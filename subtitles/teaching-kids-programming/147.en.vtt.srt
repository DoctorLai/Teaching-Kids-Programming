okay that's it so so this is the
building height so you don't

22
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:26,240
building height so you don't
 

23
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,429
building height so you don't
get any commas yeah yeah okay so

24

this ocean here ocean yeah the sea
so so when you which building can

38
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:52,800
so so when you which building can
 

39
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,069
so so when you which building can
see the ocean if you if

40
00:00:56,069 --> 00:00:56,079
see the ocean if you if
 

41
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,670
see the ocean if you if
the the buildings can see the ocean if

42
00:00:59,670 --> 00:00:59,680
the the buildings can see the ocean if
 

43
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,670
the the buildings can see the ocean if
there's no other building which is

44
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:01,680
there's no other building which is
 

45
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,270
there's no other building which is
taller which is

46
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:03,280
taller which is
 

47
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,870
taller which is
i mean which is taller or equal so

48
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:06,880
i mean which is taller or equal so
 

49
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,270
i mean which is taller or equal so
this one this one this one yeah exactly

50
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:09,280
this one this one this one yeah exactly
 

51

yeah because this
 

53
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,190
yeah because this
this is equal so no at least yeah

54
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:13,200
this is equal so no at least yeah
 

55

performance how do we perform it how do
 

95
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,630
performance how do we perform it how do
we prove once it

96
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:02,640
we prove once it
 

97
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,030
we prove once it
we check each building right yeah and we

98
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:05,040
we check each building right yeah and we
 

99
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,389
we check each building right yeah and we
check if there are buildings on the

100
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:06,399
check if there are buildings on the
 

101
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,589
check if there are buildings on the
right which is taller or equal right

102
00:02:09,589 --> 00:02:09,599
right which is taller or equal right
 

103
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:11,670
right which is taller or equal right
all right and if it's uh taller or

104
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:11,680
all right and if it's uh taller or
 

105
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,350
all right and if it's uh taller or
bigger than equal then we will always

106
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:13,360
bigger than equal then we will always
 

107
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,550
bigger than equal then we will always
give it right

108
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:14,560
give it right
 

109
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,750
give it right
so four i in range bearings yeah

110
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:17,760
so four i in range bearings yeah
 

111
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,869
so four i in range bearings yeah
and then for j in range

112
00:02:20,869 --> 00:02:20,879
and then for j in range
 

113
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,470
and then for j in range
on the right okay and then if it's

114
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:22,480
on the right okay and then if it's
 

115
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,309
on the right okay and then if it's
bigger than we skip it okay i can

116
00:02:24,309 --> 00:02:24,319
bigger than we skip it okay i can
 

117
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,229
bigger than we skip it okay i can
quickly write this code okay i watch the

118
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:26,239
quickly write this code okay i watch the
 

119
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:26,949
quickly write this code okay i watch the

if you are not given any numbers right
 

127
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,830
if you are not given any numbers right
and then return

128
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:49,840
and then return
 

129
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,670
and then return
we just determine the entity list right

130
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:51,680
we just determine the entity list right
 

131
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,030
we just determine the entity list right
and do this

132
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,040
and do this
 

133
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,509
and do this
right and then and it will be the length

134
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:55,519
right and then and it will be the length
 

135
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:56,070
right and then and it will be the length
of these

136
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:56,080
of these
 

137
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,750
of these
numbers okay

138
00:02:59,750 --> 00:02:59,760
numbers okay
 

139
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,910
numbers okay
so now look at this that has we have the

140
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:01,920
so now look at this that has we have the
 

141
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,509
so now look at this that has we have the
answer right we want to return this to

142
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:03,519
answer right we want to return this to
 

143
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:03,990
answer right we want to return this to
an answer

144
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:04,000
an answer
 

145
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,589
an answer
so let's see for i in

146
00:03:07,589 --> 00:03:07,599
so let's see for i in
 

147
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,630
so let's see for i in
range and right

148
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:10,640
range and right
 

149
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,390
range and right
we're iterating look are we going to

150
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:12,400
we're iterating look are we going to
 

151
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,550
we're iterating look are we going to
iterate in this index yeah the building

152
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:14,560
iterate in this index yeah the building
 

153
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,670
iterate in this index yeah the building
index right

154
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:15,680
index right
 

155
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,750
index right
right then we need to find it look

156
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:19,760
right then we need to find it look
 

157
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,030
right then we need to find it look
look we we have so any taller let's

158
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,040
look we we have so any taller let's
 

159
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,149
look we we have so any taller let's
let's do this

160
00:03:24,149 --> 00:03:24,159
let's do this
 

161
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,070
let's do this
any taller on the right any tall

162
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:28,080
any taller on the right any tall
 

163
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,949
any taller on the right any tall
on the right on the right on right okay

164
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:30,959
on the right on the right on right okay
 

165
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,309
on the right on the right on right okay
let's set it to false

166
00:03:32,309 --> 00:03:32,319
let's set it to false
 

167
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,630
let's set it to false
alright this is the body what's pulling

168
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:34,640
alright this is the body what's pulling
 

169
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,470
alright this is the body what's pulling
true or false

170
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:36,480
true or false
 

171
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,910
true or false
yeah so look for j in

172
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:39,920
yeah so look for j in
 

173
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,309
yeah so look for j in
range let's start fighting on the right

174
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:42,319
range let's start fighting on the right
 

175
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,030
range let's start fighting on the right
which is

176
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:43,040
which is
 

177
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,229
which is
i plus one to n right right

178
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:46,239
i plus one to n right right
 

179
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,070
i plus one to n right right
yes eric it's not there if

180
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:50,080
yes eric it's not there if
 

181
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,190
yes eric it's not there if
num j

182
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:53,200
num j
 

183
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,949
num j
bigger or equal num's i right

184
00:03:56,949 --> 00:03:56,959
bigger or equal num's i right
 

185
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,110
bigger or equal num's i right
so what does it mean here i am i here

186
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:01,120
so what does it mean here i am i here
 

187
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,270
so what does it mean here i am i here
and i start from this on the right which

188
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:03,280
and i start from this on the right which
 

189
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,750
and i start from this on the right which
is j to the n i if i check these range

190
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:05,760
is j to the n i if i check these range
 

191
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,750
is j to the n i if i check these range
if that building is taller or equal than

192
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:07,760
if that building is taller or equal than
 

193
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,710
if that building is taller or equal than
that right

194
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:08,720
that right
 

195
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,309
that right
what do i do any taller

196
00:04:12,309 --> 00:04:12,319
what do i do any taller
 

197
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:17,040
what do i do any taller
on the right

198
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,050

 

199
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:23,350

[Music]

200
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:23,360

 

201
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,590

look this is the keyboard break break

202
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:25,600
look this is the keyboard break break
 

203
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,749
look this is the keyboard break break
means that i want to

204
00:04:27,749 --> 00:04:27,759
means that i want to
 

205
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,030
means that i want to
i want to stop the iteration right

206
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:31,040
i want to stop the iteration right
 

207
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,230
i want to stop the iteration right
i want to stop this iteration so after i

208
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:34,240
i want to stop this iteration so after i
 

209
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,990
i want to stop this iteration so after i
stop iteration this any toilet would be

210
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:36,000
stop iteration this any toilet would be
 

211
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,629
stop iteration this any toilet would be
true

212
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:36,639
true
 

213
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,150
true
right then i said if not any taller

214
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,160
right then i said if not any taller
 

215
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,430
right then i said if not any taller
right any taller right or

216
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:43,440
right any taller right or
 

217
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,909
right any taller right or
on the right okay then i push this in

218
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:45,919
on the right okay then i push this in
 

219
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,830
on the right okay then i push this in
the answer dot append

220
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:49,840

 

221
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:58,310

open which i put it in the i o z

222
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:58,320

 

223
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,590

we want to check if there are any

224
00:04:59,590 --> 00:04:59,600
we want to check if there are any
 

225
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,350
we want to check if there are any
building on the right which is i plus

226
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:01,360
building on the right which is i plus
 

227
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,310
building on the right which is i plus
one to i

228
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:02,320
one to i
 

229
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,870
one to i
which is bigger than i right all right

230
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:04,880
which is bigger than i right all right
 

231
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,830
which is bigger than i right all right
yeah yeah return what

232
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:08,840

 

233
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:17,270

um

234
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:17,280

 

235
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,270

there's a loop there's another loop or

236
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:19,280
there's a loop there's another loop or
 

237
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,110
there's a loop there's another loop or
what n square all right square come on

238
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:21,120
what n square all right square come on
 

239
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,629
what n square all right square come on
what's the space complexly

240
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:22,639
what's the space complexly
 

241
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,950
what's the space complexly
if we're not considering the answer here

242
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:24,960
if we're not considering the answer here
 

243
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,909
if we're not considering the answer here
come on come on

244
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:25,919
come on come on
 

245
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,390
come on come on
yeah yeah that's right okay what's the

246
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:28,400
yeah yeah that's right okay what's the
 

247
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,590
yeah yeah that's right okay what's the
term convex now what's the space

248
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:29,600
term convex now what's the space
 

249
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,270
term convex now what's the space
complexity if we are not considering

250
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:31,280
complexity if we are not considering
 

251
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,110
complexity if we are not considering
this is an additional space because this

252
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:33,120
this is an additional space because this
 

253
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,150
this is an additional space because this
is the output we're going to need anyway

254
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:36,160
is the output we're going to need anyway
 

255
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,150
is the output we're going to need anyway
so we don't use any other space so

256
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:38,160
so we don't use any other space so
 

257
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,830
so we don't use any other space so
what's the space complexity one

258
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:39,840
what's the space complexity one
 

259
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,710
what's the space complexity one
oh one or one one okay we're done can we

260
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:42,720
oh one or one one okay we're done can we
 

261
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,749
oh one or one one okay we're done can we
do better

262
00:05:43,749 --> 00:05:43,759
do better
 

263
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,310
do better
maybe we can maybe we can

264
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:48,320
maybe we can maybe we can
 

265
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,670
maybe we can maybe we can
yes we could definitely okay so look why

266
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:51,680
yes we could definitely okay so look why
 

267
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,790
yes we could definitely okay so look why
look if we use the the thing here is

268
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:54,800
look if we use the the thing here is
 

269
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,350
look if we use the the thing here is
that

270
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:55,360
that
 

271
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,430
that
eric the thing when the previous

272
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:57,440
eric the thing when the previous
 

273
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,270
eric the thing when the previous
approach is though because

274
00:05:59,270 --> 00:05:59,280
approach is though because
 

275
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,670
approach is though because
every time we're checking this building

276
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:01,680
every time we're checking this building
 

277
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,270
every time we're checking this building
we need to check if there are

278
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:03,280
we need to check if there are
 

279
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,830
we need to check if there are
taller buildings on the right right yeah

280
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:05,840
taller buildings on the right right yeah
 

281
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,270
taller buildings on the right right yeah
so this is slow yeah

282
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:07,280
so this is slow yeah
 

283
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,309
so this is slow yeah
can we do can we pre-calculate the

284
00:06:10,309 --> 00:06:10,319
can we do can we pre-calculate the
 

285
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,189
can we do can we pre-calculate the
pre-calculate the max right does it make

286
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:13,199
pre-calculate the max right does it make
 

287
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:13,990
pre-calculate the max right does it make
sense

288
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:14,000
sense
 

289
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,110
sense
so look i mean if at this point

290
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,120
so look i mean if at this point
 

291
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,150
so look i mean if at this point
i know the max right so if the max right

292
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,160
i know the max right so if the max right
 

293
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,070
i know the max right so if the max right
is smaller than the current building

294
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:22,080
is smaller than the current building
 

295
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,590
is smaller than the current building
then we know right

296
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:23,600
then we know right
 

297
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,749
then we know right
we know we can see the option right does

298
00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:25,759
we know we can see the option right does
 

299
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:26,629
we know we can see the option right does
it make sense

300
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:26,639
it make sense
 

301
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,110
it make sense
so we can do this we can store this next

302
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:29,120
so we can do this we can store this next
 

303
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,230
so we can do this we can store this next
right array

304
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:30,240
right array
 

305
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,590
right array
for each point um on the right right so

306
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:33,600
for each point um on the right right so
 

307
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,309
for each point um on the right right so
look

308
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:36,319

 

309
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,629

look at that let's do this defined now

310
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:38,639
look at that let's do this defined now
 

311
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,469
look at that let's do this defined now
let's let's do a

312
00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:40,479
let's let's do a
 

313
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,230
let's let's do a
fine that's something i can just define

314
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:42,240
fine that's something i can just define
 

315
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,909
fine that's something i can just define
it to make sure

316
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:43,919
it to make sure
 

317
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,710
it to make sure
yeah if not this is the same yeah return

318
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:48,720
yeah if not this is the same yeah return
 

319
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,710
yeah if not this is the same yeah return
return empty empty yeah

320
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:52,720
return empty empty yeah
 

321
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,589
return empty empty yeah
so n equals what lens num right we want

322
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:55,599
so n equals what lens num right we want
 

323
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:56,309
so n equals what lens num right we want
to know this

324
00:06:56,309 --> 00:06:56,319
to know this
 

325
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,510
to know this
right the length and then we do this max

326
00:06:59,510 --> 00:06:59,520
right the length and then we do this max
 

327
00:06:59,520 --> 00:06:59,990
right the length and then we do this max
right

328
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,000
right
 

329
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,110
right
next right okay just max r okay

330
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:03,120
next right okay just max r okay
 

331
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,870
next right okay just max r okay
it's the same array which at the

332
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:04,880
it's the same array which at the
 

333
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,790
it's the same array which at the
beginning we set it to zero

334
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:06,800
beginning we set it to zero
 

335
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,830
beginning we set it to zero
times n right times n okay

336
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:09,840
times n right times n okay
 

337
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,749
times n right times n okay
all right so this is this max y is the

338
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:13,759
all right so this is this max y is the
 

339
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,430
all right so this is this max y is the
same size of the buildings

340
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:15,440
same size of the buildings
 

341
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,550
same size of the buildings
and for each each animal it means that

342
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:18,560
and for each each animal it means that
 

343
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,430
and for each each animal it means that
what's the maximum height building

344
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:21,440
what's the maximum height building
 

345
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,070
what's the maximum height building
what's the maximum building

346
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:24,080
what's the maximum building
 

347
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,830
what's the maximum building
what's the what's the tallest building

348
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:25,840
what's the what's the tallest building
 

349
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,510
what's the what's the tallest building
on the right right

350
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:27,520
on the right right
 

351
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,189
on the right right
doesn't make sense okay now let's do

352
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:29,199
doesn't make sense okay now let's do
 

353
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,990
doesn't make sense okay now let's do
this look

354
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:32,000

 

355
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,950

let's do this current maximum equals

356
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:34,960
let's do this current maximum equals
 

357
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,670
let's do this current maximum equals
zero let's start from zero okay for

358
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:37,680
zero let's start from zero okay for
 

359
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,870
zero let's start from zero okay for
i in one range

360
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:40,880
i in one range
 

361
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,589
i in one range
we start from the right most n minus one

362
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:43,599
we start from the right most n minus one
 

363
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:44,869
we start from the right most n minus one
tl

364
00:07:44,869 --> 00:07:44,879
tl
 

365
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,110
tl
minus one zero and every time i

366
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:47,120
minus one zero and every time i
 

367
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,469
minus one zero and every time i
decrement one right

368
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:48,479
decrement one right
 

369
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,589
decrement one right
yeah so this will go for locally

370
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:51,599
yeah so this will go for locally
 

371
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,710
yeah so this will go for locally
so i will be from n minus one and minus

372
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:54,720
so i will be from n minus one and minus
 

373
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,029
so i will be from n minus one and minus
minus three until zero right because not

374
00:07:57,029 --> 00:07:57,039
minus three until zero right because not
 

375
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,070
minus three until zero right because not
up to minus one

376
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:58,080
up to minus one
 

377
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,749
up to minus one
every time i decrement one right this

378
00:07:59,749 --> 00:07:59,759
every time i decrement one right this
 

379
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,749
every time i decrement one right this
one's mean way down

380
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:01,759
one's mean way down
 

381
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,510
one's mean way down
look and then now look max are current x

382
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:05,520
look and then now look max are current x
 

383
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,029
look and then now look max are current x
max our i will be equal to current max

384
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:09,039
max our i will be equal to current max
 

385
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:09,510
max our i will be equal to current max
yeah

386
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:09,520
yeah
 

387
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,749
yeah
the rightmost building the current mix

388
00:08:11,749 --> 00:08:11,759
the rightmost building the current mix
 

389
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,189
the rightmost building the current mix
look eric

390
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:13,199
look eric
 

391
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,430
look eric
the right monster this is ocean yeah

392
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:15,440
the right monster this is ocean yeah
 

393
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,749
the right monster this is ocean yeah
yeah this is ocean

394
00:08:17,749 --> 00:08:17,759
yeah this is ocean
 

395
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,189
yeah this is ocean
the rightmost building it's let's see

396
00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:21,199
the rightmost building it's let's see
 

397
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,070
the rightmost building it's let's see
the right most

398
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:22,080
the right most
 

399
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,629
the right most
building height max right will be zero

400
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:24,639
building height max right will be zero
 

401
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:25,189
building height max right will be zero
right

402
00:08:25,189 --> 00:08:25,199
right
 

403
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,150
right
because you can always see right yeah it

404
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:28,160
because you can always see right yeah it
 

405
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,749
because you can always see right yeah it
doesn't have any building on the top on

406
00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:29,759
doesn't have any building on the top on
 

407
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,230
doesn't have any building on the top on
the right

408
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:30,240
the right
 

409
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,070
the right
to this year and now we can do this

410
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:32,080
to this year and now we can do this
 

411
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,909
to this year and now we can do this
color max

412
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:33,919
color max
 

413
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,949
color max
equals max color max

414
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:36,959
equals max color max
 

415
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,149
equals max color max
yeah and then building numbers

416
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:40,159
yeah and then building numbers
 

417
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,670
yeah and then building numbers
nums i right does it make sense

418
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:43,680
nums i right does it make sense
 

419
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,070
nums i right does it make sense
yeah does it make sense look at it so

420
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:46,080
yeah does it make sense look at it so
 

421
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,949
yeah does it make sense look at it so
look

422
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:46,959
look
 

423
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,630
look
we are scanning the building we're

424
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:48,640
we are scanning the building we're
 

425
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,150
we are scanning the building we're
scanning the building from the right to

426
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:50,160
scanning the building from the right to
 

427
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,590
scanning the building from the right to
the left

428
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:51,600
the left
 

429
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,310
the left
yeah so every time we remember because

430
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:54,320
yeah so every time we remember because
 

431
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,509
yeah so every time we remember because
we're going through the right to the

432
00:08:55,509 --> 00:08:55,519
we're going through the right to the
 

433
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,509
we're going through the right to the
left we're remembering the max

434
00:08:57,509 --> 00:08:57,519
left we're remembering the max
 

435
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,710
left we're remembering the max
buildings met taller buildings on the

436
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:00,720
buildings met taller buildings on the
 

437
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,829
buildings met taller buildings on the
sofa does it make sense

438
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:03,839
sofa does it make sense
 

439
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,550
sofa does it make sense
yeah yeah so with this now we can do

440
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:06,560
yeah yeah so with this now we can do
 

441
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,310
yeah yeah so with this now we can do
this answer

442
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:08,320
this answer
 

443
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,350
this answer
equals this and then four let's do it

444
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:11,360
equals this and then four let's do it
 

445
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,949
equals this and then four let's do it
from the left to the right yeah

446
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:12,959
from the left to the right yeah
 

447
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,070
from the left to the right yeah
for i in range range

448
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:16,080
for i in range range
 

449
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,630
for i in range range
and yeah we go through this index yeah

450
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:18,640
and yeah we go through this index yeah
 

451
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,829
and yeah we go through this index yeah
look and then

452
00:09:19,829 --> 00:09:19,839
look and then
 

453
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:27,590
look and then
if

454
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:27,600

 

455
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,350

can you tell me if current building

456
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:29,360
can you tell me if current building
 

457
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,790
can you tell me if current building
height is bigger than what

458
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:30,800
height is bigger than what
 

459
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,550
height is bigger than what
the white max y yeah

460
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:34,560
the white max y yeah
 

461
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,550
the white max y yeah
yeah because we already know this array

462
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:36,560
yeah because we already know this array
 

463
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,230
yeah because we already know this array
max drive i right

464
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:38,240
max drive i right
 

465
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,230
max drive i right
right let's make sense if current

466
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:40,240
right let's make sense if current
 

467
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,269
right let's make sense if current
building is

468
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:41,279
building is
 

469
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,910
building is
maximum it's more than the maximum on

470
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:43,920
maximum it's more than the maximum on
 

471
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,710
maximum it's more than the maximum on
the right

472
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:44,720
the right
 

473
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,829
the right
then we push this index right right

474
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:47,839
then we push this index right right
 

475
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,310
then we push this index right right
append i right does it make sense and

476
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:50,320
append i right does it make sense and
 

477
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,150
append i right does it make sense and
return what

478
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:52,160
return what
 

479
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:57,590
return what
answer what's the time complexity

480
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:57,600
answer what's the time complexity
 

481
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,389
answer what's the time complexity
here is a loop and here is another loop

482
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:00,399
here is a loop and here is another loop
 

483
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,750
here is a loop and here is another loop
the number previously was

484
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:01,760
the number previously was
 

485
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,509
the number previously was
two loops together now i have two

486
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:03,519
two loops together now i have two
 

487
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,190
two loops together now i have two
separate loops so what's the term

488
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:05,200
separate loops so what's the term
 

489
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:10,470
separate loops so what's the term
university

490
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:10,480

 

491
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,310

yeah that's right because this is ln and

492
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:12,320
yeah that's right because this is ln and
 

493
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,230
yeah that's right because this is ln and
this is d independent right

494
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:14,240
this is d independent right
 

495
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,269
this is d independent right
two o n you can say it's two to n right

496
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:17,279
two o n you can say it's two to n right
 

497
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,030
two o n you can say it's two to n right
but we drop a constant right does it

498
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:19,040
but we drop a constant right does it
 

499
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,949
but we drop a constant right does it
make sense so it's on

500
00:10:20,949 --> 00:10:20,959
make sense so it's on
 

501
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,710
make sense so it's on
right what's the space complexity

502
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:24,720
right what's the space complexity
 

503
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:32,710
right what's the space complexity
what's the space complexity

504
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:32,720
what's the space complexity
 

505
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,670
what's the space complexity
no look we are using this right here oh

506
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:35,680
no look we are using this right here oh
 

507
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:35,990
no look we are using this right here oh
n

508
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:36,000
n
 

509
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,310
n
yeah o n because we are using this not

510
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:38,320
yeah o n because we are using this not
 

511
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,269
yeah o n because we are using this not
not

512
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:39,279
not
 

513
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,590
not
we are not counting this output anyway

514
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:41,600
we are not counting this output anyway
 

515
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,829
we are not counting this output anyway
so police we need to store the number of

516
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:43,839
so police we need to store the number of
 

517
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,150
so police we need to store the number of
the

518
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:44,160
the
 

519
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,710
the
the maximum right but can we do better

520
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:46,720
the maximum right but can we do better
 

521
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,630
the maximum right but can we do better
without storing it do we actually need

522
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:48,640
without storing it do we actually need
 

523
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,069
without storing it do we actually need
to store the max height

524
00:10:50,069 --> 00:10:50,079
to store the max height
 

525
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,509
to store the max height
on the right all right do we need to

526
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:53,519
on the right all right do we need to
 

527
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,389
on the right all right do we need to
store the next

528
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:54,399
store the next
 

529
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,550
store the next
next right on the i mean on the right i

530
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:56,560
next right on the i mean on the right i
 

531
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:05,509
next right on the i mean on the right i
mean every time we start on

532
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:05,519

 

533
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,750

can we just do it on the go like can we

534
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:07,760
can we just do it on the go like can we
 

535
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,430
can we just do it on the go like can we
just do it here

536
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:09,440
just do it here
 

537
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,949
just do it here
yeah yeah because look current max is

538
00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:12,959
yeah yeah because look current max is
 

539
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,630
yeah yeah because look current max is
the max right that doesn't make sense

540
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:14,640
the max right that doesn't make sense
 

541
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:14,949
the max right that doesn't make sense
look

542
00:11:14,949 --> 00:11:14,959
look
 

543
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,949
look
current max is the maximum we will we

544
00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:16,959
current max is the maximum we will we
 

545
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,870
current max is the maximum we will we
can just use it here

546
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:18,880
can just use it here
 

547
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,470
can just use it here
does it make sense yeah

548
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:22,480
does it make sense yeah
 

549
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,230
does it make sense yeah
so how can we do this we can do this

550
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:24,240
so how can we do this we can do this
 

551
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,670
so how can we do this we can do this
look uh in

552
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:25,680
look uh in
 

553
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,949
look uh in
current max yeah max then uh we don't

554
00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:28,959
current max yeah max then uh we don't
 

555
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,110
current max yeah max then uh we don't
need this yeah kind of max

556
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:31,120
need this yeah kind of max
 

557
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,630
need this yeah kind of max
so color max equals zero

558
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:34,640
so color max equals zero
 

559
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,269
so color max equals zero
right and then look at zebra no we don't

560
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:37,279
right and then look at zebra no we don't
 

561
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,310
right and then look at zebra no we don't
need this yeah

562
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:38,320
need this yeah
 

563
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,990
need this yeah
uh we just do this for range for i in

564
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:42,000
uh we just do this for range for i in
 

565
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,310
uh we just do this for range for i in
and maybe here answer answer answer

566
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:44,320
and maybe here answer answer answer
 

567
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,590
and maybe here answer answer answer
equals left

568
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:45,600
equals left
 

569
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,150
equals left
for i in when we start from like right

570
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:48,160
for i in when we start from like right
 

571
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:48,949
for i in when we start from like right
look and

572
00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:48,959
look and
 

573
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,150
look and
if nums

574
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:52,160
if nums
 

575
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,509
if nums
i bigger than color max right

576
00:11:55,509 --> 00:11:55,519
i bigger than color max right
 

577
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,870
i bigger than color max right
does it make sense when we answer

578
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:58,880
does it make sense when we answer
 

579
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,389
does it make sense when we answer
stop append append

580
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:02,399
stop append append
 

581
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,550
stop append append
i and then comma max

582
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:06,560
i and then comma max
 

583
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,590
i and then comma max
equals max current max

584
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:11,600
equals max current max
 

585
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,030
equals max current max
and what what what's your play here huh

586
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:15,040
and what what what's your play here huh
 

587
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,910
and what what what's your play here huh
what should i put here column x equals

588
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:17,920
what should i put here column x equals
 

589
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,750
what should i put here column x equals
max current max we are getting we want

590
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:19,760
max current max we are getting we want
 

591
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,590
max current max we are getting we want
to store the maximum of current

592
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:21,600
to store the maximum of current
 

593
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,550
to store the maximum of current
which is columns carbon max is the max

594
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:24,560
which is columns carbon max is the max
 

595
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,230
which is columns carbon max is the max
building next total building on the

596
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:26,240
building next total building on the
 

597
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:26,790
building next total building on the
right

598
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:26,800
right
 

599
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,389
right
so now i'm at this no it will be lamb's

600
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:30,399
so now i'm at this no it will be lamb's
 

601
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,910
so now i'm at this no it will be lamb's
eye right because this is the

602
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:31,920
eye right because this is the
 

603
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,509
eye right because this is the
current building right does it make

604
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:33,519
current building right does it make
 

605
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,670
current building right does it make
sense this is the same as

606
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:35,680
sense this is the same as
 

607
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,710
sense this is the same as
if nums i bigger than current max

608
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:38,720
if nums i bigger than current max
 

609
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,670
if nums i bigger than current max
then i updated column x equals max times

610
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:41,680
then i updated column x equals max times
 

611
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,430
then i updated column x equals max times
i doesn't make sense

612
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:45,440

 

613
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,190

and look because we are going through

614
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:47,200
and look because we are going through
 

615
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,710
and look because we are going through
the right to the left so every time

616
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:48,720
the right to the left so every time
 

617
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,829
the right to the left so every time
we're pushing this book

618
00:12:49,829 --> 00:12:49,839
we're pushing this book
 

619
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,069
we're pushing this book
so for example the rightmost if it's

620
00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:52,079
so for example the rightmost if it's
 

621
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,069
so for example the rightmost if it's
four that we're pushing the array as

622
00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:54,079
four that we're pushing the array as
 

623
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:54,470
four that we're pushing the array as
four

624
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:54,480
four
 

625
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,190
four
three two one it's all it's in a reverse

626
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:57,200
three two one it's all it's in a reverse
 

627
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,710
three two one it's all it's in a reverse
order right

628
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:58,720
order right
 

629
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,389
order right
yeah so what should we do we can answer

630
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:00,399
yeah so what should we do we can answer
 

631
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,069
yeah so what should we do we can answer
what we should we should reverse this

632
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:02,079
what we should we should reverse this
 

633
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,790
what we should we should reverse this
return all of them do it now we can

634
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:04,800
return all of them do it now we can
 

635
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,509
return all of them do it now we can
answer

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,910
this answer
uh i'm not sure but just this all you

668
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:43,920
uh i'm not sure but just this all you
 

669
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,629
uh i'm not sure but just this all you
can do this two pointer thing to reverse

670
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:46,639
can do this two pointer thing to reverse
 

671
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,710
can do this two pointer thing to reverse
manually yeah if you want to but but

672
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:48,720
manually yeah if you want to but but
 

673
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,670
manually yeah if you want to but but
this is the

674
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:49,680
this is the
 

675
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,470
this is the
clean syntax to reverse it does it make

676
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:52,480
clean syntax to reverse it does it make
 

677
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,750
clean syntax to reverse it does it make
sense

678
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:53,760
sense
 

679
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,430
sense
does it make sense yeah okay

680
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:57,440
does it make sense yeah okay
 

681
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,990
does it make sense yeah okay
so can we i mean what's the time come

682
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:00,000
so can we i mean what's the time come
 

683
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,829
so can we i mean what's the time come
next yes breaks complexity here

684
00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:03,839
next yes breaks complexity here
 

685
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,829
next yes breaks complexity here
oh and here we only have one loop now

686
00:14:05,829 --> 00:14:05,839
oh and here we only have one loop now
 

687
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,350
oh and here we only have one loop now
right it's one

688
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:07,360
right it's one
 

689
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,910
right it's one
end right yeah what's the space

690
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:09,920
end right yeah what's the space
 

691
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,310
end right yeah what's the space
complexity

692
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:12,320
complexity
 

693
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,110
complexity
what's the space compressor area are we

694
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:15,120
what's the space compressor area are we
 

695
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,310
what's the space compressor area are we
using any space here

696
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:16,320
using any space here
 

697
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:22,150
using any space here
no so what's the space company

698
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:22,160

 

699
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,550

okay so these are the different ways of

700
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:24,560
okay so these are the different ways of
 

701
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,670
okay so these are the different ways of
doing it and we have

702
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:25,680
doing it and we have
 

703
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,829
doing it and we have
another way of doing it which is called

704
00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:27,839
another way of doing it which is called
 

705
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,269
another way of doing it which is called
monotone

706
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:29,279
monotone
 

707
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,870
monotone
monitor decreasing monotone decreasing

708
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:32,880
monitor decreasing monotone decreasing
 

709
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,949
monitor decreasing monotone decreasing
step this is a new concept

710
00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:34,959
step this is a new concept
 

711
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:39,030
step this is a new concept
so what's monotone monotone

712
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:39,040
so what's monotone monotone
 

713
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,590
so what's monotone monotone
turners decreasing decreasing step

714
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:43,600
turners decreasing decreasing step
 

715
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,750
turners decreasing decreasing step
what's the stack can you it's a

716
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:47,760
what's the stack can you it's a
 

717
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,490
what's the stack can you it's a
step

718
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:49,500
step
 

719
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,110
step
[Music]

720
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:51,120
[Music]
 

721
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,470
[Music]
stack yeah what's that is the one

722
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:54,480
stack yeah what's that is the one
 

723
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,230
stack yeah what's that is the one
first but blocked

724
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:58,240
first but blocked
 

725
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,069
first but blocked
it's like a pile of things so you put a

726
00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:00,079
it's like a pile of things so you put a
 

727
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,990
it's like a pile of things so you put a
thing in you put a thing

728
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:02,000
thing in you put a thing
 

729
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,110
thing in you put a thing
look you're pressing one two three four

730
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:05,120
look you're pressing one two three four
 

731
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,710
look you're pressing one two three four
right and when you take it out you'll be

732
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:06,720
right and when you take it out you'll be
 

733
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,710
right and when you take it out you'll be
four three two one all right

734
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:08,720
four three two one all right
 

735
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,990
four three two one all right
yes so you pick up put a bigger plate on

736
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:12,000
yes so you pick up put a bigger plate on
 

737
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,550
yes so you pick up put a bigger plate on
first but the bigger play you always

738
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:14,560
first but the bigger play you always
 

739
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,990
first but the bigger play you always
take in the last right

740
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:16,000
take in the last right
 

741
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,670
take in the last right
you put it one two three four in this

742
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:17,680
you put it one two three four in this
 

743
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,030
you put it one two three four in this
order but when you take it out you'll be

744
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:19,040
order but when you take it out you'll be
 

745
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,030
order but when you take it out you'll be
four three two one doesn't make sense

746
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,040
four three two one doesn't make sense
 

747
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,030
four three two one doesn't make sense
yeah because this is the bottom step

748
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:23,040
yeah because this is the bottom step
 

749
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,710
yeah because this is the bottom step
this is the top of the step

750
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:24,720
this is the top of the step
 

751
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,030
this is the top of the step
so the thing here is the monotonous

752
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:27,040
so the thing here is the monotonous
 

753
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,710
so the thing here is the monotonous
decreasing step what's monotonous

754
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:30,720
decreasing step what's monotonous
 

755
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,110
decreasing step what's monotonous
monotonous means the thin finger you're

756
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:33,120
monotonous means the thin finger you're
 

757
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,949
monotonous means the thin finger you're
always increasing or you always

758
00:15:34,949 --> 00:15:34,959
always increasing or you always
 

759
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:35,910
always increasing or you always
decreasing

760
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:35,920
decreasing
 

761
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,150
decreasing
look please remember eric i told you

762
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:38,160
look please remember eric i told you
 

763
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,189
look please remember eric i told you
this concept

764
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:39,199
this concept
 

765
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,790
this concept
before look y equals x the graph is this

766
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:42,800
before look y equals x the graph is this
 

767
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,790
before look y equals x the graph is this
right array array look this same i'm

768
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:44,800
right array array look this same i'm
 

769
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,030
right array array look this same i'm
going to don't draw this is not drawing

770
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:47,040
going to don't draw this is not drawing
 

771
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,310
going to don't draw this is not drawing
lesson come on

772
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:48,320
lesson come on
 

773
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,949
lesson come on
this is x this is y this so this graph

774
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:50,959
this is x this is y this so this graph
 

775
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,430
this is x this is y this so this graph
is y equals x yeah

776
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:53,440
is y equals x yeah
 

777
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,790
is y equals x yeah
is this smaller than us increasing

778
00:15:58,790 --> 00:15:58,800

 

779
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,829

maybe yes because when x increases y

780
00:16:01,829 --> 00:16:01,839
maybe yes because when x increases y
 

781
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,870
maybe yes because when x increases y
also increased right yeah awesome

782
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:04,880
also increased right yeah awesome
 

783
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,150
also increased right yeah awesome
so is this monotonous decreasing

784
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:08,160
so is this monotonous decreasing
 

785
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,509
so is this monotonous decreasing
nope why not why increase x

786
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:11,519
nope why not why increase x
 

787
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,150
nope why not why increase x
x increasing y decreasing so monotonous

788
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:14,160
x increasing y decreasing so monotonous
 

789
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,030
x increasing y decreasing so monotonous
means

790
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:15,040
means
 

791
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,550
means
you're always increasing or you're

792
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:16,560
you're always increasing or you're
 

793
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,389
you're always increasing or you're
always decreasing right

794
00:16:18,389 --> 00:16:18,399
always decreasing right
 

795
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,069
always decreasing right
does it make sense that's what it means

796
00:16:20,069 --> 00:16:20,079
does it make sense that's what it means
 

797
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,230
does it make sense that's what it means
monotone mono terminals

798
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:22,240
monotone mono terminals
 

799
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,509
monotone mono terminals
single right all right doesn't make

800
00:16:25,509 --> 00:16:25,519
single right all right doesn't make
 

801
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:26,629
single right all right doesn't make
sense

802
00:16:26,629 --> 00:16:26,639
sense
 

803
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,670
sense
so monitor the decreasing step is that

804
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:29,680
so monitor the decreasing step is that
 

805
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,870
so monitor the decreasing step is that
every time we making sure the stack

806
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:32,880
every time we making sure the stack
 

807
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,670
every time we making sure the stack
the elements in the stack is always

808
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:35,680
the elements in the stack is always
 

809
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,910
the elements in the stack is always
decreasing so so look

810
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:37,920
decreasing so so look
 

811
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,189
decreasing so so look
so let's say three five

812
00:16:41,189 --> 00:16:41,199
so let's say three five
 

813
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,230
so let's say three five
four two

814
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:44,240
four two
 

815
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,590
four two
one okay so what's the answer here maybe

816
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:47,600
one okay so what's the answer here maybe
 

817
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,829
one okay so what's the answer here maybe
i have a maybe i have at least

818
00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:51,839
i have a maybe i have at least
 

819
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,629
i have a maybe i have at least
four two four one okay so what's the

820
00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:54,639
four two four one okay so what's the
 

821
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:55,990
four two four one okay so what's the
answer here

822
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:56,000
answer here
 

823
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,749
answer here
what's the answer which building can see

824
00:16:57,749 --> 00:16:57,759
what's the answer which building can see
 

825
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:02,230
what's the answer which building can see
that on the right

826
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:02,240

 

827
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,750

this is zero index 41.

828
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:05,760
this is zero index 41.
 

829
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,549
this is zero index 41.
sorry so it's four not this one

830
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:08,559
sorry so it's four not this one
 

831
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:09,990
sorry so it's four not this one
definitely yeah

832
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:10,000
definitely yeah
 

833
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,710
definitely yeah
not this one right so it's it's this one

834
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:12,720
not this one right so it's it's this one
 

835
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,309
not this one right so it's it's this one
yeah you can see this from here

836
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:14,319
yeah you can see this from here
 

837
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,029
yeah you can see this from here
and only this one yeah these two right

838
00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:17,039
and only this one yeah these two right
 

839
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,549
and only this one yeah these two right
so you'll be one

840
00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:18,559
so you'll be one
 

841
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,189
so you'll be one
thing oh yeah yeah yeah this one see i

842
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:21,199
thing oh yeah yeah yeah this one see i
 

843
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:22,230
thing oh yeah yeah yeah this one see i
told you

844
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:22,240
told you
 

845
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,590
told you
okay four to one yeah you're all right

846
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:23,600
okay four to one yeah you're all right
 

847
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,829
okay four to one yeah you're all right
four to one okay okay

848
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:25,839
four to one okay okay
 

849
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,510
four to one okay okay
yeah so can we look at can i simulate

850
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:29,520
yeah so can we look at can i simulate
 

851
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,350
yeah so can we look at can i simulate
this monotonous decreasing stack so i

852
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:31,360
this monotonous decreasing stack so i
 

853
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,270
this monotonous decreasing stack so i
have a stack

854
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:33,280
have a stack
 

855
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,029
have a stack
i have a stack okay yeah yeah

856
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:37,039
i have a stack okay yeah yeah
 

857
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,470
i have a stack okay yeah yeah
so look i'm going through

858
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:40,480
so look i'm going through
 

859
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,630
so look i'm going through
i'm going through three i put a three

860
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:42,640
i'm going through three i put a three
 

861
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,710
i'm going through three i put a three
here i put a three in here

862
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:44,720
here i put a three in here
 

863
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,270
here i put a three in here
all right yeah there's nothing uh

864
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:47,280
all right yeah there's nothing uh
 

865
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,230
all right yeah there's nothing uh
there's nothing

866
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:48,240
there's nothing
 

867
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,270
there's nothing
in a stack so i put it put it uh put it

868
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:51,280
in a stack so i put it put it uh put it
 

869
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,870
in a stack so i put it put it uh put it
in a stack okay

870
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:52,880
in a stack okay
 

871
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,669
in a stack okay
okay now look for

872
00:17:57,669 --> 00:17:57,679
okay now look for
 

873
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,390
okay now look for
when i i want to put the four in so i

874
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:00,400
when i i want to put the four in so i
 

875
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,430
when i i want to put the four in so i
want before that

876
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:01,440
want before that
 

877
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,070
want before that
i want to make sure all the elements in

878
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:04,080
i want to make sure all the elements in
 

879
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,750
i want to make sure all the elements in
the stack

880
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:05,760
the stack
 

881
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,110
the stack
are strictly bigger

882
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:09,120
are strictly bigger
 

883
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,190
are strictly bigger
if it's smaller i just don't want it

884
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:11,200
if it's smaller i just don't want it
 

885
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,470
if it's smaller i just don't want it
does it make sense

886
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:12,480
does it make sense
 

887
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,950
does it make sense
so i only put a four so is three bigger

888
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:14,960
so i only put a four so is three bigger
 

889
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,510
so i only put a four so is three bigger
than four

890
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:15,520
than four
 

891
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,029
than four
is three smaller or equal than four

892
00:18:19,029 --> 00:18:19,039
is three smaller or equal than four
 

893
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,990
is three smaller or equal than four
yes what's bigger no i mean three is

894
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:22,000
yes what's bigger no i mean three is
 

895
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,190
yes what's bigger no i mean three is
smaller than the fourth

896
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:23,200
smaller than the fourth
 

897
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,270
smaller than the fourth
so i take it out because i don't want

898
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:25,280
so i take it out because i don't want
 

899
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,710
so i take it out because i don't want
any

900
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:26,720
any
 

901
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,630
any
numbers they are smaller or equal than

902
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:28,640
numbers they are smaller or equal than
 

903
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,470
numbers they are smaller or equal than
common number yeah and it's empty and

904
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:30,480
common number yeah and it's empty and
 

905
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,310
common number yeah and it's empty and
put the four here

906
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:32,320
put the four here
 

907
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:37,110
put the four here
one is four smaller now right

908
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:37,120
one is four smaller now right
 

909
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,190
one is four smaller now right
four is bigger right let's try i put one

910
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:39,200
four is bigger right let's try i put one
 

911
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,470
four is bigger right let's try i put one
in so always

912
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:40,480
in so always
 

913
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,230
in so always
this direction it's always decreasing

914
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:42,240
this direction it's always decreasing
 

915
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,870
this direction it's always decreasing
right two

916
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:44,880
right two
 

917
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,909
right two
you take one out yeah because i one

918
00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:47,919
you take one out yeah because i one
 

919
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,669
you take one out yeah because i one
one and not two is not if i put the two

920
00:18:49,669 --> 00:18:49,679
one and not two is not if i put the two
 

921
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,430
one and not two is not if i put the two
here so it's always decreasing yeah when

922
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:51,440
here so it's always decreasing yeah when
 

923
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,029
here so it's always decreasing yeah when
you read it from the bottom to the top

924
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:53,039
you read it from the bottom to the top
 

925
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,870
you read it from the bottom to the top
it's always decreasing for two and then

926
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:54,880
it's always decreasing for two and then
 

927
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,230
it's always decreasing for two and then
one

928
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:56,240
one
 

929
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,830
one
it's okay yeah because two is bigger

930
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:57,840
it's okay yeah because two is bigger
 

931
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,510
it's okay yeah because two is bigger
than it right i only take a smaller one

932
00:18:59,510 --> 00:18:59,520
than it right i only take a smaller one
 

933
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,390
than it right i only take a smaller one
yeah

934
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:00,400
yeah
 

935
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,830
yeah
okay so the answer is four to one

936
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:03,840
okay so the answer is four to one
 

937
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,430
okay so the answer is four to one
yeah does it make sense

938
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:07,440

 

939
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,830

do you get it all right you together

940
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:09,840
do you get it all right you together
 

941
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,430
do you get it all right you together
this is why is common

942
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:11,440
this is why is common
 

943
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,750
this is why is common
monotonous why is it common can you

944
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:13,760
monotonous why is it common can you
 

945
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,549
monotonous why is it common can you
explain to me

946
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:14,559
explain to me
 

947
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,590
explain to me
why this why this is monotonous all

948
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:17,600
why this why this is monotonous all
 

949
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,669
why this why this is monotonous all
right

950
00:19:19,669 --> 00:19:19,679
right
 

951
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,070
right
all right okay so uh yeah you know

952
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:24,080
all right okay so uh yeah you know
 

953
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,310
all right okay so uh yeah you know
where you

954
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:28,320

 

955
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,270

ta-da so what why is this explain to me

956
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:31,280
ta-da so what why is this explain to me
 

957
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,110
ta-da so what why is this explain to me
why is this what's my mother i think

958
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:33,120
why is this what's my mother i think
 

959
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:33,669
why is this what's my mother i think
this is

960
00:19:33,669 --> 00:19:33,679
this is
 

961
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,230
this is
x and this is y and this graph is y

962
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:36,240
x and this is y and this graph is y
 

963
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,510
x and this is y and this graph is y
equals x right

964
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:37,520
equals x right
 

965
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,789
equals x right
so what's one answer say uh

966
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:40,799
so what's one answer say uh
 

967
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:45,909
so what's one answer say uh
when x is increasing y is increasing

968
00:19:45,909 --> 00:19:45,919

 

969
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,390

okay so let's look at this square for y

970
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:48,400
okay so let's look at this square for y
 

971
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,789
okay so let's look at this square for y
equals x square

972
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:50,799
equals x square
 

973
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,190
equals x square
okay y equals x square right look all

974
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:53,200
okay y equals x square right look all
 

975
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,070
okay y equals x square right look all
right

976
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:54,080
right
 

977
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,669
right
is this monotonous increasing or

978
00:19:55,669 --> 00:19:55,679
is this monotonous increasing or
 

979
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,909
is this monotonous increasing or
decreasing no why is that

980
00:19:57,909 --> 00:19:57,919
decreasing no why is that
 

981
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,990
decreasing no why is that
because uh you know where like

982
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:02,000
because uh you know where like
 

983
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,590
because uh you know where like
what it's like

984
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:05,600
what it's like
 

985
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,350
what it's like
the it decreases then yeah on the right

986
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:09,360
the it decreases then yeah on the right
 

987
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,070
the it decreases then yeah on the right
or the

988
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:10,080
or the
 

989
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,630
or the
on the right half of the graph is

990
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:12,640
on the right half of the graph is
 

991
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,470
on the right half of the graph is
monetary increasing but on the left

992
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:14,480
monetary increasing but on the left
 

993
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,990
monetary increasing but on the left
right left part is one thing

994
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:16,000
right left part is one thing
 

995
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,270
right left part is one thing
decreasing yeah when x is bigger y is

996
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:19,280
decreasing yeah when x is bigger y is
 

997
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,510
decreasing yeah when x is bigger y is
smaller along this part when x is bigger

998
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:21,520
smaller along this part when x is bigger
 

999
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,870
smaller along this part when x is bigger
x is y is bigger right all right so this

1000
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:24,880
x is y is bigger right all right so this
 

1001
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,310
x is y is bigger right all right so this
is not monotonous increasing or

1002
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:26,320
is not monotonous increasing or
 

1003
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:26,950
is not monotonous increasing or
decreasing

1004
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:26,960
decreasing
 

1005
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,510
decreasing
so let's stack here eric can can i have

1006
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:29,520
so let's stack here eric can can i have
 

1007
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,750
so let's stack here eric can can i have
your attention please

1008
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:31,760
your attention please
 

1009
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,789
your attention please
can i find your attention please so

1010
00:20:34,789 --> 00:20:34,799
can i find your attention please so
 

1011
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,909
can i find your attention please so
the monotony decreasing means that we

1012
00:20:37,909 --> 00:20:37,919
the monotony decreasing means that we
 

1013
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:38,470
the monotony decreasing means that we
want to

1014
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:38,480
want to
 

1015
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,789
want to
maintain a stack that all the stack

1016
00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:40,799
maintain a stack that all the stack
 

1017
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:41,750
maintain a stack that all the stack
elements

1018
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:41,760
elements
 

1019
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,870
elements
right are strictly decreasing right all

1020
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:44,880
right are strictly decreasing right all
 

1021
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,270
right are strictly decreasing right all
right

1022
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:45,280
right
 

1023
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,549
right
yeah okay doesn't make sense how are we

1024
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:48,559
yeah okay doesn't make sense how are we
 

1025
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,230
yeah okay doesn't make sense how are we
doing this we push before we push the

1026
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:50,240
doing this we push before we push the
 

1027
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,669
doing this we push before we push the
new element into the stack

1028
00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:51,679
new element into the stack
 

1029
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,789
new element into the stack
we pop out we pop out all the elements

1030
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:54,799
we pop out we pop out all the elements
 

1031
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,470
we pop out we pop out all the elements
that are smaller or equal than the

1032
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:56,480
that are smaller or equal than the
 

1033
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,750
that are smaller or equal than the
current stack right

1034
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:57,760
current stack right
 

1035
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,990
current stack right
current current element right yeah and

1036
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:00,000
current current element right yeah and
 

1037
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,149
current current element right yeah and
if they are smaller i just pop it out so

1038
00:21:02,149 --> 00:21:02,159
if they are smaller i just pop it out so
 

1039
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,110
if they are smaller i just pop it out so
that it the remaining element on the

1040
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:05,120
that it the remaining element on the
 

1041
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,230
that it the remaining element on the
stack

1042
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:06,240
stack
 

1043
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,870
stack
is is what is bigger or smaller than the

1044
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:08,880
is is what is bigger or smaller than the
 

1045
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,390
is is what is bigger or smaller than the
current element

1046
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:10,400
current element
 

1047
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,909
current element
if i pop all the elements that are

1048
00:21:11,909 --> 00:21:11,919
if i pop all the elements that are
 

1049
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,590
if i pop all the elements that are
smaller or equal than the color anyway

1050
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:13,600
smaller or equal than the color anyway
 

1051
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:13,990
smaller or equal than the color anyway
and then

1052
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:14,000
and then
 

1053
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,190
and then
the remaining is bigger right yeah okay

1054
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:17,200
the remaining is bigger right yeah okay
 

1055
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:23,590
the remaining is bigger right yeah okay
okay let's do it let's do this

1056
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:23,600

 

1057
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,430

define f lumps

1058
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:27,440
define f lumps
 

1059
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,549
define f lumps
okay if not

1060
00:21:30,549 --> 00:21:30,559
okay if not
 

1061
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,710
okay if not
this is the special case when numbers is

1062
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:32,720
this is the special case when numbers is
 

1063
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,669
this is the special case when numbers is
empty now with

1064
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:33,679
empty now with
 

1065
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,430
empty now with
10 return here okay let's do this stack

1066
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:37,440
10 return here okay let's do this stack
 

1067
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,110
10 return here okay let's do this stack
equals 20 right look

1068
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:41,120
equals 20 right look
 

1069
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,870
equals 20 right look
for index and hide

1070
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:44,880
for index and hide
 

1071
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,149
for index and hide
in innumerable yeah still remember

1072
00:21:48,149 --> 00:21:48,159
in innumerable yeah still remember
 

1073
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,430
in innumerable yeah still remember
normally

1074
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:51,440

 

1075
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,029

eric do you still remember this in

1076
00:21:53,029 --> 00:21:53,039
eric do you still remember this in
 

1077
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,110
eric do you still remember this in
numeric function

1078
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:55,120
numeric function
 

1079
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,149
numeric function
uh maybe okay look

1080
00:21:58,149 --> 00:21:58,159
uh maybe okay look
 

1081
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,870
uh maybe okay look
maybe look at the numerator function

1082
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:00,880
maybe look at the numerator function
 

1083
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,590
maybe look at the numerator function
look is

1084
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:01,600
look is
 

1085
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,549
look is
look at this already is 5 3 2 right yeah

1086
00:22:04,549 --> 00:22:04,559
look at this already is 5 3 2 right yeah
 

1087
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,549
look at this already is 5 3 2 right yeah
so in illuminate i and s will become

1088
00:22:06,549 --> 00:22:06,559
so in illuminate i and s will become
 

1089
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,710
so in illuminate i and s will become
what i will become i will be index right

1090
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:08,720
what i will become i will be index right
 

1091
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,669
what i will become i will be index right
is 0 1

1092
00:22:09,669 --> 00:22:09,679
is 0 1
 

1093
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,510
is 0 1
2 h u will become 5 32 that's why

1094
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:13,520
2 h u will become 5 32 that's why
 

1095
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,590
2 h u will become 5 32 that's why
it is look does it make sense

1096
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:17,600

 

1097
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,630

yeah okay okay let's say normally if you

1098
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:20,640
yeah okay okay let's say normally if you
 

1099
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,110
yeah okay okay let's say normally if you
don't

1100
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:21,120
don't
 

1101
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,950
don't
immunize you can enumerate over the

1102
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:22,960
immunize you can enumerate over the
 

1103
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,149
immunize you can enumerate over the
value you can

1104
00:22:24,149 --> 00:22:24,159
value you can
 

1105
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,470
value you can
go through the value which is 531 but i

1106
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:26,480
go through the value which is 531 but i
 

1107
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,830
go through the value which is 531 but i
want to have the index

1108
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:27,840
want to have the index
 

1109
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,430
want to have the index
right yeah i want to have the index

1110
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:31,440
right yeah i want to have the index
 

1111
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,310
right yeah i want to have the index
so it's it's a clean way of doing this

1112
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:34,320
so it's it's a clean way of doing this
 

1113
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,029
so it's it's a clean way of doing this
so in this way it means i will be 0.2

1114
00:22:37,029 --> 00:22:37,039
so in this way it means i will be 0.2
 

1115
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,029
so in this way it means i will be 0.2
and h will be the value by 3 2.

1116
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:39,039
and h will be the value by 3 2.
 

1117
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,430
and h will be the value by 3 2.
so i can have access to the iron h at

1118
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:41,440
so i can have access to the iron h at
 

1119
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,870
so i can have access to the iron h at
the same time otherwise you

1120
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:42,880
the same time otherwise you
 

1121
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,830
the same time otherwise you
you need to write the i for i in now

1122
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:45,840
you need to write the i for i in now
 

1123
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,390
you need to write the i for i in now
wrench

1124
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:46,400
wrench
 

1125
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,350
wrench
in range right that's num right and then

1126
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:49,360
in range right that's num right and then
 

1127
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,190
in range right that's num right and then
actually will be

1128
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:51,200
actually will be
 

1129
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,630
actually will be
nums i doesn't make sense

1130
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:54,640
nums i doesn't make sense
 

1131
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,390
nums i doesn't make sense
this is the same thing as what for

1132
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:58,400
this is the same thing as what for
 

1133
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,669
this is the same thing as what for
i in look array wrench

1134
00:23:01,669 --> 00:23:01,679
i in look array wrench
 

1135
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,110
i in look array wrench
wrench lens num and then i was

1136
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:05,120
wrench lens num and then i was
 

1137
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,390
wrench lens num and then i was
asked what's that i just told you

1138
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:08,400
asked what's that i just told you
 

1139
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,710
asked what's that i just told you
what's equivalent to this one actually

1140
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:10,720
what's equivalent to this one actually
 

1141
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,510
what's equivalent to this one actually
would be what

1142
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:11,520
would be what
 

1143
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,870
would be what
equals what the height yeah

1144
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:14,880
equals what the height yeah
 

1145
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,710
equals what the height yeah
what what's that i have an index what's

1146
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:16,720
what what's that i have an index what's
 

1147
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,549
what what's that i have an index what's
edge i

1148
00:23:18,549 --> 00:23:18,559
edge i
 

1149
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,630
edge i
noms i come on that's why it is

1150
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:22,640
noms i come on that's why it is
 

1151
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,830
noms i come on that's why it is
yeah you iterate with the x right

1152
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:25,840
yeah you iterate with the x right
 

1153
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,750
yeah you iterate with the x right
yeah yeah this is the index this is this

1154
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:27,760
yeah yeah this is the index this is this
 

1155
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,830
yeah yeah this is the index this is this
alright i can also be

1156
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:29,840
alright i can also be
 

1157
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,909
alright i can also be
writing in this way if you prefer this

1158
00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:31,919
writing in this way if you prefer this
 

1159
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,070
writing in this way if you prefer this
look away

1160
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:34,080
look away
 

1161
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,669
look away
i equals zero and then i can do this for

1162
00:23:37,669 --> 00:23:37,679
i equals zero and then i can do this for
 

1163
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,190
i equals zero and then i can do this for
for h in num i italy over the

1164
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:41,200
for h in num i italy over the
 

1165
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,909
for h in num i italy over the
lambs right and every time i do this h

1166
00:23:43,909 --> 00:23:43,919
lambs right and every time i do this h
 

1167
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,669
lambs right and every time i do this h
equals my and then i do this i plus

1168
00:23:45,669 --> 00:23:45,679
equals my and then i do this i plus
 

1169
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,750
equals my and then i do this i plus
equal one so this is my preferred way of

1170
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:47,760
equal one so this is my preferred way of
 

1171
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,190
equal one so this is my preferred way of
doing because you are creating this

1172
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:49,200
doing because you are creating this
 

1173
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,310
doing because you are creating this
variable and you're doing

1174
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:50,320
variable and you're doing
 

1175
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,029
variable and you're doing
adding new manually and this is okay

1176
00:23:53,029 --> 00:23:53,039
adding new manually and this is okay
 

1177
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,029
adding new manually and this is okay
this is the most elegant way because i

1178
00:23:55,029 --> 00:23:55,039
this is the most elegant way because i
 

1179
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,190
this is the most elegant way because i
can iterate over the index and the value

1180
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:57,200
can iterate over the index and the value
 

1181
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,630
can iterate over the index and the value
at the same time because they come in

1182
00:23:58,630 --> 00:23:58,640
at the same time because they come in
 

1183
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,990
at the same time because they come in
the pair right

1184
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:00,000
the pair right
 

1185
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,190
the pair right
yes okay so now

1186
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:03,200
yes okay so now
 

1187
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,070
yes okay so now
look i always iterate inh before that i

1188
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:06,080
look i always iterate inh before that i
 

1189
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:06,950
look i always iterate inh before that i
need to check

1190
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:06,960
need to check
 

1191
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,990
need to check
wire wire stack this and

1192
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:10,000
wire wire stack this and
 

1193
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,029
wire wire stack this and
the there they are elements in the stack

1194
00:24:13,029 --> 00:24:13,039
the there they are elements in the stack
 

1195
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,830
the there they are elements in the stack
and we are pushing the index right and

1196
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:15,840
and we are pushing the index right and
 

1197
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,830
and we are pushing the index right and
what

1198
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:16,840
what
 

1199
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:20,870
what
nums what's the top of the stack

1200
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:20,880
nums what's the top of the stack
 

1201
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,789
nums what's the top of the stack
um here is the stack what's the top of

1202
00:24:22,789 --> 00:24:22,799
um here is the stack what's the top of
 

1203
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,830
um here is the stack what's the top of
the stack what's this

1204
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:25,840

00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,870
minus one this index yeah and the
numbers look

1210
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:32,880
numbers look
 

1211
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,070
numbers look
if it's smaller or equal than current

1212
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:36,080
if it's smaller or equal than current
 

1213

if it's smaller or equal than current
height right

1214
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:37,360
height right
 

1215
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,789
height right
what do we do we want to can we get rid

1216
00:24:40,789 --> 00:24:40,799
what do we do we want to can we get rid
 

1217
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:41,590
what do we do we want to can we get rid
of it yeah

1218
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:41,600
of it yeah
 

1219
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,070
of it yeah
so if we want to erase the last one how

1220
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:44,080
so if we want to erase the last one how
 

1221
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,510
so if we want to erase the last one how
do we what's the

1222
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:45,520
do we what's the
 

1223
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,350
do we what's the
functional st come on you know

1224
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:49,360
functional st come on you know
 

1225
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,390
functional st come on you know
talk yes pop just pop pop is

1226
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:52,400
talk yes pop just pop pop is
 

1227
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,510
talk yes pop just pop pop is
is talk we know the last element is

1228
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:55,520
is talk we know the last element is
 

1229
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,190
is talk we know the last element is
a one constant but if at least you want

1230
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:57,200
a one constant but if at least you want
 

1231
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,830
a one constant but if at least you want
to remove the first one what's called

1232
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:58,840
to remove the first one what's called
 

1233
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:03,909
to remove the first one what's called
power

1234
00:25:03,909 --> 00:25:03,919

 

1235
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,430

if you want to remove the first one it's

1236
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:05,440
if you want to remove the first one it's
 

1237
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,190
if you want to remove the first one it's
pop one

1238
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:09,200

 

1239
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,310

yeah and popping the first one is linear

1240
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:12,320
yeah and popping the first one is linear
 

1241
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,510
yeah and popping the first one is linear
time yeah

1242
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:13,520
time yeah
 

1243
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,590
time yeah
this this is slightly different than the

1244
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:15,600
this this is slightly different than the
 

1245
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,590
this this is slightly different than the
dq double ndq which is

1246
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:17,600
dq double ndq which is
 

1247
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,230
dq double ndq which is
you can push and pop on both sides which

1248
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:20,240
you can push and pop on both sides which
 

1249
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,990
you can push and pop on both sides which
are all one constant okay

1250
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:22,000
are all one constant okay
 

1251
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,990
are all one constant okay
so after that look and then the

1252
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:24,000
so after that look and then the
 

1253
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,909
so after that look and then the
remaining of the stack

1254
00:25:25,909 --> 00:25:25,919
remaining of the stack
 

1255
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,430
remaining of the stack
ah what other elements that are bigger

1256
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:29,440
ah what other elements that are bigger
 

1257
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,590
ah what other elements that are bigger
right they are bigger or smaller than

1258
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:31,600
right they are bigger or smaller than
 

1259
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,000
right they are bigger or smaller than
the current element

1260
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,010

this is to remove the smallest element

1264
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:39,120
this is to remove the smallest element
 

1265
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,390
this is to remove the smallest element
before

1266
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:40,400
before
 

1267
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,390
before
current height so the remaining is one

1268
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:44,400
current height so the remaining is one
 

1269
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,990
current height so the remaining is one

thing is look i have

1272
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:49,200
thing is look i have
 

1273
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,190
thing is look i have
four and now i want to five here and i

1274
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:51,200
four and now i want to five here and i
 

1275
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,789
four and now i want to five here and i
want to remove this

1276
00:25:52,789 --> 00:25:52,799
want to remove this
 

1277
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,630
want to remove this
the remaining thing is what is that

1278
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:54,640
the remaining thing is what is that
 

1279
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,029
the remaining thing is what is that
right i know if that six six is not

1280
00:25:57,029 --> 00:25:57,039
right i know if that six six is not
 

1281
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,710
right i know if that six six is not
removed right so the remaining are

1282
00:25:58,710 --> 00:25:58,720
removed right so the remaining are
 

1283
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,510
removed right so the remaining are
bigger than the

1284
00:25:59,510 --> 00:25:59,520
bigger than the
 

1285
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,630
bigger than the
current height equation remember yeah

1286
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:02,640
current height equation remember yeah
 

1287
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,310
current height equation remember yeah
right so now i need to put st dot what

1288
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:06,320
right so now i need to put st dot what
 

1289
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:15,269
right so now i need to put st dot what
what i want to push this height

1290
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:15,279

 

1291
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:16,710

yeah we want to push the index and

1292
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:16,720
yeah we want to push the index and
 

1293
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,630
yeah we want to push the index and

they this is the final

1300
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:23,440
they this is the final
 

1301
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,909
they this is the final
remember the final stage in a step which

1302
00:26:25,909 --> 00:26:25,919
remember the final stage in a step which
 

1303
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:26,470
remember the final stage in a step which
is which

1304
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:26,480
is which
 

1305
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,669
is which
can be uh simulated using a list right

1306
00:26:29,669 --> 00:26:29,679
can be uh simulated using a list right
 

1307
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,149
can be uh simulated using a list right
in python you can use the list to to

1308
00:26:32,149 --> 00:26:32,159
in python you can use the list to to
 

1309
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:33,750
in python you can use the list to to
simulate the stack because this is the

1310
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:33,760
simulate the stack because this is the
 

1311
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,590
simulate the stack because this is the
top of stack yeah you can pop it in your

1312
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:35,600
top of stack yeah you can pop it in your
 

1313
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,750
top of stack yeah you can pop it in your
squishy right does it make sense and

1314
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:37,760
squishy right does it make sense and
 

1315
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,950
squishy right does it make sense and
then look

1316
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:38,960
then look
 

1317
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,789
then look
okay so can can you explain to me just

1318
00:26:40,789 --> 00:26:40,799
okay so can can you explain to me just
 

1319
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,149
okay so can can you explain to me just
this one can you explain to me what

1320
00:26:42,149 --> 00:26:42,159
this one can you explain to me what
 

1321
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:43,830
this one can you explain to me what
oscars

1322
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:43,840
oscars
 

1323
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,870
oscars
so like you know uh say like

1324
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:46,880
so like you know uh say like
 

1325
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:55,820
so like you know uh say like
uh yeah yeah yeah

1326
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:55,830

 

1327
00:26:55,830 --> 00:27:01,190

[Music]

1328
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:01,200
[Music]
 

1329
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,950
[Music]
so you know then you put this bit

1330
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:04,960
so you know then you put this bit
 

1331
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,430
so you know then you put this bit
okay look at that current stack is that

1332
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:07,440
okay look at that current stack is that
 

1333
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,870
okay look at that current stack is that
three

1334
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:08,880
three
 

1335
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,390
three
five uh

1336
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:12,400
five uh
 

1337
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,750
five uh
two uh

1338
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:15,760
two uh
 

1339
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,549
two uh
one okay and then now let's say i have

1340
00:27:18,549 --> 00:27:18,559
one okay and then now let's say i have
 

1341
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:21,269
one okay and then now let's say i have
an email four h is four

1342
00:27:21,269 --> 00:27:21,279
an email four h is four
 

1343
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,950
an email four h is four
so what happened here what happened here

1344
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:22,960
so what happened here what happened here
 

1345
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,310
so what happened here what happened here
if i have four coming in

1346
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:24,320
if i have four coming in
 

1347
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,149
if i have four coming in
what happened so a four yeah because if

1348
00:27:28,149 --> 00:27:28,159
what happened so a four yeah because if
 

1349
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,230
what happened so a four yeah because if
because it's uh the top of the stack is

1350
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:30,240
because it's uh the top of the stack is
 

1351
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,750
because it's uh the top of the stack is
st minus one right

1352
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:31,760
st minus one right
 

1353
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,909
st minus one right
so that means it's it's as

1354
00:27:35,909 --> 00:27:35,919
so that means it's it's as
 

1355
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,630
so that means it's it's as
small as so we pop it out pop it out and

1356
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:38,640
small as so we pop it out pop it out and
 

1357
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:38,950
small as so we pop it out pop it out and
then

1358
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:38,960
then
 

1359
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,510
then
and put four in it and then put this one

1360
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:41,520
and put four in it and then put this one
 

1361
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,870
and put four in it and then put this one
no no you're not poking

1362
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:42,880
no no you're not poking
 

1363
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,909
no no you're not poking
too far in you you keep popping until

1364
00:27:45,909 --> 00:27:45,919
too far in you you keep popping until
 

1365
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,149
too far in you you keep popping until
the end top of element is bigger than

1366
00:27:48,149 --> 00:27:48,159
the end top of element is bigger than
 

1367
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:49,190
the end top of element is bigger than
that right

1368
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:49,200
that right
 

1369
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,789
that right
you're not popping one you keep popping

1370
00:27:50,789 --> 00:27:50,799
you're not popping one you keep popping
 

1371
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,789
you're not popping one you keep popping
that's a why why

1372
00:27:52,789 --> 00:27:52,799
that's a why why
 

1373
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,950
that's a why why
why there's anime in a step and the top

1374
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:54,960
why there's anime in a step and the top
 

1375
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,870
why there's anime in a step and the top
of the step is smaller than

1376
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:56,880
of the step is smaller than
 

1377
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,350
of the step is smaller than
four right it's smaller than four and i

1378
00:27:59,350 --> 00:27:59,360
four right it's smaller than four and i
 

1379
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,230
four right it's smaller than four and i
get rid of it and here is bigger

1380
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:02,240
get rid of it and here is bigger
 

1381
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,149
get rid of it and here is bigger
yeah and here is bigger then i don't pop

1382
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:04,159
yeah and here is bigger then i don't pop
 

1383
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:05,830
yeah and here is bigger then i don't pop
it and i put a four in this is probably

1384
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:05,840
it and i put a four in this is probably
 

1385
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,470
it and i put a four in this is probably
for it

1386
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:06,480
for it
 

1387
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,870
for it
so what what happened here is that this

1388
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:08,880
so what what happened here is that this
 

1389
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,669
so what what happened here is that this
is my

1390
00:28:09,669 --> 00:28:09,679
is my
 

1391
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:11,909
is my
it's the stack will be always decreasing

1392
00:28:11,909 --> 00:28:11,919
it's the stack will be always decreasing
 

1393
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:13,350
it's the stack will be always decreasing
this is st right

1394
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:13,360
this is st right
 

1395
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,990
this is st right
that's t0 as t1 is there so it's all be

1396
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:16,000
that's t0 as t1 is there so it's all be
 

1397
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,430
that's t0 as t1 is there so it's all be
decreasing right

1398
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:17,440
decreasing right
 

1399
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,029
decreasing right
that's called the monotone decreasing

1400
00:28:19,029 --> 00:28:19,039
that's called the monotone decreasing
 

1401
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,630
that's called the monotone decreasing
step does it make sense yeah

1402
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:20,640
step does it make sense yeah
 

1403
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,630
step does it make sense yeah
yeah okay what's here what's this part

1404
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:22,640
yeah okay what's here what's this part
 

1405
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,070
yeah okay what's here what's this part
okay come on

thank you let's let's do it return st
okay what which

1412
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:40,080
okay what which
 

1413
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,070
okay what which
which measure is the best and which one

1414
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:42,080
which measure is the best and which one
 

1415
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,230
which measure is the best and which one
you like why we

1416
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:44,240
you like why we
 

1417
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,549
you like why we
what's the term complexity of this one

1418
00:28:46,549 --> 00:28:46,559
what's the term complexity of this one
 

1419
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:47,909
what's the term complexity of this one
all right what's the term complexity of

1420
00:28:47,909 --> 00:28:47,919
all right what's the term complexity of
 

1421
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:51,669
all right what's the term complexity of
this one

1422
00:28:51,669 --> 00:28:51,679

 

1423
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:59,110

um oh and yes what's a space complexity

1424
00:28:59,110 --> 00:28:59,120
um oh and yes what's a space complexity
 

1425
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,110
um oh and yes what's a space complexity
are we using any additional space

1426
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:01,120
are we using any additional space
 

1427
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,389
are we using any additional space
somewhere

1428
00:29:02,389 --> 00:29:02,399
somewhere
 

1429
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:06,389
somewhere
just yeah straight yeah

1430
00:29:06,389 --> 00:29:06,399
just yeah straight yeah
 

1431
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,789
just yeah straight yeah
and which one is the best it's the

1432
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:08,799
and which one is the best it's the
 

1433
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:09,430
and which one is the best it's the
optimum

1434
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:09,440
optimum
 

1435
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,549
optimum
number one before the one before o o n

1436
00:29:12,549 --> 00:29:12,559
number one before the one before o o n
 

1437
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,070
number one before the one before o o n
and o one right we don't need the space

1438
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:14,080
and o one right we don't need the space
 

1439
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,070
and o one right we don't need the space
but keeping the maximum all right right

1440
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:16,080
but keeping the maximum all right right
 

1441
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,590
but keeping the maximum all right right
yeah and which one do you like
