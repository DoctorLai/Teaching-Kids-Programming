hello mr eric mr ryan how are you
what's final research tree can you tell

4
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:06,240
what's final research tree can you tell
 

5
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,910
what's final research tree can you tell
me what's funny

6
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:11,920

 

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,270

numbers yes and on the left of the root

8
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:15,280
numbers yes and on the left of the root
 

9
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,189
numbers yes and on the left of the root
it's smaller and on the right of the

10
00:00:17,189 --> 00:00:17,199
it's smaller and on the right of the
 

11
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,950
it's smaller and on the right of the
root it's bigger

12
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:18,960
root it's bigger
 

13
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,349
root it's bigger
yeah okay so the only

14
00:00:21,349 --> 00:00:21,359
yeah okay so the only
 

15
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,830
yeah okay so the only
the left tree the notes on the left tree

16
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:23,840
the left tree the notes on the left tree
 

17
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,509
the left tree the notes on the left tree
are strictly smaller than the parents

18
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:25,519
are strictly smaller than the parents
 

19
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,109
are strictly smaller than the parents
and on the other side the right the

20
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:27,119
and on the other side the right the
 

21
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,189
and on the other side the right the
downs on the right tree are strictly

22
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:29,199
downs on the right tree are strictly
 

23
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,870
downs on the right tree are strictly
bigger than a

24
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:30,880
bigger than a
 

25
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,590
bigger than a
parent which which order which order

26
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:33,600
parent which which order which order
 

27
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,310
parent which which order which order
gives you know you know the least in

28
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:36,320
gives you know you know the least in
 

29
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,790
gives you know you know the least in
order if we travel the final stage 3 in

30
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:38,800
order if we travel the final stage 3 in
 

31
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,510
order if we travel the final stage 3 in
which order and we get

32
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:41,520
which order and we get
 

33
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,190
which order and we get
to get the

34
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:43,200
to get the
 

35
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,150
to get the
list in order the sequence in order yeah

36
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:46,160
list in order the sequence in order yeah
 

37
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,750
list in order the sequence in order yeah
which order is it

38
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:47,760
which order is it
 

39
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,990
which order is it
i give a few sorry

40
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:50,000
i give a few sorry
 

41
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,150
i give a few sorry
we are done in order which is two three

42
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:52,160
we are done in order which is two three
 

43
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,709
we are done in order which is two three
four so it is what this is now this is

44
00:00:54,709 --> 00:00:54,719
four so it is what this is now this is
 

45
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,670
four so it is what this is now this is
leveraged right so it's l and r okay in

46
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:57,680
leveraged right so it's l and r okay in
 

47
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,029
leveraged right so it's l and r okay in
order okay

48
00:00:59,029 --> 00:00:59,039
order okay
 

49
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,869
order okay
and which order gives the reverse order

50
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:02,879
and which order gives the reverse order
 

51
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,390
and which order gives the reverse order
gives the four

52
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:04,400
gives the four
 

53
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,830
gives the four
rn

54
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:05,840
rn
 

55
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,910
rn
ah and there this is called reversing

56
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:07,920
ah and there this is called reversing
 

57
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,149
ah and there this is called reversing
order okay you can't reverse enough

58
00:01:10,149 --> 00:01:10,159
order okay you can't reverse enough
 

59
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,590
order okay you can't reverse enough
okay so today's task is very simple

60
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:13,600
okay so today's task is very simple
 

61
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,070
okay so today's task is very simple

so if there's one one one note
 

85
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,310
so if there's one one one note
how many ways can we construct the

86
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:44,320
how many ways can we construct the
 

87
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,990
how many ways can we construct the
binary search tree

88
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,000
binary search tree
 

89
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,550
binary search tree
if there's one note one

90
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:48,560
if there's one note one
 

91
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,510
if there's one note one
it's just one yeah if it's two notes

92
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:51,520
it's just one yeah if it's two notes
 

93
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,190
it's just one yeah if it's two notes
two

235
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,189

so and when n equals three we got a five

236
00:05:03,189 --> 00:05:03,199
so and when n equals three we got a five
 

237
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,550
so and when n equals three we got a five
answer yes five the answer equals five

238
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:06,560
answer yes five the answer equals five
 

239
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,510
answer yes five the answer equals five
so how how do we i mean do you have any

240
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:09,520
so how how do we i mean do you have any
 

241
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,670
so how how do we i mean do you have any
idea how to become

242
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:11,680
idea how to become
 

243
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,390
idea how to become
we can't using a counter using the calls

244
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:14,400
we can't using a counter using the calls
 

245
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,970
we can't using a counter using the calls
based on what how do we count

246
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:15,980
based on what how do we count
 

247
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,270
based on what how do we count

dynamic programming but yeah we use the

250
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:20,400
dynamic programming but yeah we use the
 

251
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,990
dynamic programming but yeah we use the
anime program but you need to tell me

252
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:22,000
anime program but you need to tell me
 

253
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,830
anime program but you need to tell me
how

yeah but we first we need to find out
 

257
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,390
yeah but we first we need to find out
the way to compute the value okay to

258
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:32,400
the way to compute the value okay to
 

259
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,070
the way to compute the value okay to
compute based on the number of loads

260
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:34,080
compute based on the number of loads
 

261
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,590
compute based on the number of loads
yeah yeah

262
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:35,600
yeah yeah
 

263
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,469

okay so
 

277
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,790
okay so
let's define a g function g n

278
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:00,800
let's define a g function g n
 

279
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,350
let's define a g function g n
g function

280
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:03,360
g function
 

281
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,469
g function
g n means the number of ways we can

282
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:06,479
g n means the number of ways we can
 

283
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,230
g n means the number of ways we can
represent okay this is not gone the

284
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:08,240
represent okay this is not gone the
 

285
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,990
represent okay this is not gone the
number of ways would represent these the

286
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:10,000
number of ways would represent these the
 

287
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,909
number of ways would represent these the
number of uh financial

288
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:11,919
number of uh financial
 

289
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,309
number of uh financial
unique financial tree with endnote okay

290
00:06:14,309 --> 00:06:14,319
unique financial tree with endnote okay
 

291
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,309
unique financial tree with endnote okay
this is the answer we are going to

292
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:16,319
this is the answer we are going to
 

293
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,550
this is the answer we are going to
look for okay

294

the answer we're going to look for okay
so now

300
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:26,000

 

301
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,150

g n is the number of unique

302
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:28,160
g n is the number of unique
 

303
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,590
g n is the number of unique
uh

304
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:29,600
uh
 

305
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,110
uh
this is the answer we're going to look

306
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:31,120
this is the answer we're going to look
 

307
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,150
this is the answer we're going to look
for okay so um

308
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:36,160

 

309
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,189

we define another function f i n means

310
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:39,199
we define another function f i n means
 

311
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,070
we define another function f i n means
that if there are n nodes and if we

312
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:42,080
that if there are n nodes and if we
 

313
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,550
that if there are n nodes and if we
place the i as the root

314
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:44,560
place the i as the root
 

315
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,430
place the i as the root
okay

316
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:45,440
okay
 

317
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,469
okay
if we place the i as the root here

318
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:48,479
if we place the i as the root here
 

319
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,710
if we place the i as the root here
is that n knows so can you tell me first

320
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:50,720
is that n knows so can you tell me first
 

321
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,350
is that n knows so can you tell me first
question is how many notes if i prefer

322
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:53,360
question is how many notes if i prefer
 

323
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,430
question is how many notes if i prefer
the i in the root how many notes on the

324
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:55,440
the i in the root how many notes on the
 

325
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,670
the i in the root how many notes on the
left-hand side

326
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:57,680
left-hand side
 

327
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,150

n

340
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:13,520

 

341
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,870

minus

342
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:14,880
minus
 

343
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,029
minus
i

344
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:17,039
i
 

345
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,029
i
so f i n

346
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:19,039
so f i n
 

347
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,550
so f i n
is it equal to g

348
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:22,560
is it equal to g
 

349
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,230
is it equal to g
i minus y

350
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:24,240
i minus y
 

351
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,670
i minus y
and g

352
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:25,680
and g
 

353
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,830
and g
n minus i so

354
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:27,840
n minus i so
 

355
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,110
n minus i so
is it plus or multiple multiple multiple

356
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:31,120
is it plus or multiple multiple multiple
 

357
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,550
is it plus or multiple multiple multiple
yes because look these two are

358
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:32,560
yes because look these two are
 

359
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,150
yes because look these two are
independent yeah the combination should

360
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:34,160
independent yeah the combination should
 

361
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,710
independent yeah the combination should
be multiplied together so this is the

362
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:36,720
be multiplied together so this is the
 

363
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,270
be multiplied together so this is the
function and then

364
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:39,280
function and then
 

365
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,150
function and then
uh

366
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:40,160
uh
 

367
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,629
uh
g n

368
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:42,639
g n
 

369
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,189
g n
there are n notes and how many ways i

370
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:45,199
there are n notes and how many ways i
 

371
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,589
there are n notes and how many ways i
can put the i i put a

372
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:47,599
can put the i i put a
 

373
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,749
can put the i i put a
uh put a note uh

374
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:49,759
uh put a note uh
 

375
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,790
uh put a note uh
you know how many how many possibilities

376
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:52,800
you know how many how many possibilities
 

377
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,990
you know how many how many possibilities
can we choose to place the root note if

378
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:56,000
can we choose to place the root note if
 

379
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,550
can we choose to place the root note if
there are unknowns

380
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:00,560

 

381
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,150

how many if that and if i have three

382
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:02,160
how many if that and if i have three
 

383
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,230
how many if that and if i have three
notes how many how many different ways

384
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:04,240
notes how many how many different ways
 

385
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,029
notes how many how many different ways
we can put the dude

386
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:07,039
we can put the dude
 

387
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,510
we can put the dude
come on that's an easy question

388
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:09,520
come on that's an easy question
 

389
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,830
come on that's an easy question
no no i mean the root three yes okay so

390
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:11,840
no no i mean the root three yes okay so
 

391
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,110
no no i mean the root three yes okay so
look this because each each node can be

392
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:15,120
look this because each each node can be
 

393
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,830
look this because each each node can be
chosen as the loot right so this way we

394
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:17,840
chosen as the loot right so this way we
 

395
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,790
chosen as the loot right so this way we
can say

396
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:18,800
can say
 

397
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,150
can say
is what

398
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:20,160
is what
 

399
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,150
is what
s

400
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:22,160
s
 

401
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:29,270
s
f1 n plus f2 n plus t t of s and n right

402
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:29,280
f1 n plus f2 n plus t t of s and n right
 

403
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,469
f1 n plus f2 n plus t t of s and n right
yeah

404
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:30,479
yeah
 

405
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,430
yeah
yeah simple yeah so this one

406
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:33,440
yeah simple yeah so this one
 

407
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,589
yeah simple yeah so this one
we can use the mathematics symbol to

408
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:35,599
we can use the mathematics symbol to
 

409
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,670
we can use the mathematics symbol to
simplify look yeah this one

410
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:39,680
simplify look yeah this one
 

411
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,670
simplify look yeah this one
we can do it as this symbol look

412
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:41,680
we can do it as this symbol look
 

413
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,149
we can do it as this symbol look
remember we talked about this symbol

414
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:44,159
remember we talked about this symbol
 

415
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,269
remember we talked about this symbol
yeah like e for the opposite of e

416
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:47,279
yeah like e for the opposite of e
 

417
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,310
yeah like e for the opposite of e
right

418
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:48,320
right
 

419
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,230
right
this one yeah opposite of e this one

420
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:50,240
this one yeah opposite of e this one
 

421
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,110
this one yeah opposite of e this one
will be

422
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:51,120
will be
 

423
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,389
will be
i equals 1 to n

424
00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:54,399
i equals 1 to n
 

425
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,750
i equals 1 to n
s

426
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:55,760
s
 

427
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,550
s
i

428
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:56,560
i
 

429
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,470
i
n right so look f 1 n plus f 2 n plus s

430
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:00,480
n right so look f 1 n plus f 2 n plus s
 

431
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,030
n right so look f 1 n plus f 2 n plus s
3 and plus t of f and then e course

432
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,040
3 and plus t of f and then e course
 

433
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,389
3 and plus t of f and then e course
equals this yeah

434
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:04,399
equals this yeah
 

435
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,509
equals this yeah
sum this leaves us some

436
00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:07,519
sum this leaves us some
 

437
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,990
sum this leaves us some
sum of f i n where i is from i plus i

438
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:12,000
sum of f i n where i is from i plus i
 

439
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,750
sum of f i n where i is from i plus i
equals 1 to n right

440
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:13,760
equals 1 to n right
 

441
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,190
equals 1 to n right
correct so this is look so look if we

442
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:17,200
correct so this is look so look if we
 

443
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,670
correct so this is look so look if we
use this one substitute these two here

444
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:19,680
use this one substitute these two here
 

445
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,550
use this one substitute these two here
so what do we get so we can just do this

446
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:22,560
so what do we get so we can just do this
 

447
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,670
so what do we get so we can just do this
so g

448
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:25,680

 

449
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,790

g n equals sum of i equals 1 to n

450
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:30,800
g n equals sum of i equals 1 to n
 

451
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,509
g n equals sum of i equals 1 to n
g

452
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:31,519
g
 

453
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,310
g
i minus 1 times g

454
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:34,320
i minus 1 times g
 

455
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,630
i minus 1 times g
n minus i okay so this is the function

456
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:36,640
n minus i okay so this is the function
 

457
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,630
n minus i okay so this is the function
we get dynamic programming function

458
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:38,640
we get dynamic programming function
 

459
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,190
we get dynamic programming function
what's the g zero

460
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:41,200
what's the g zero
 

461
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,710
what's the g zero
c zero equals one g zero equals

462
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:44,720
c zero equals one g zero equals
 

463
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,790
c zero equals one g zero equals
g zero and g one equals one

464
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:46,800
g zero and g one equals one
 

465
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,670
g zero and g one equals one
yeah the face cases look t t1 is one

466
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:49,680
yeah the face cases look t t1 is one
 

467
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,389
yeah the face cases look t t1 is one
yeah

468
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:50,399
yeah
 

469
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,310
yeah
okay so look these labels are from one

470
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:52,320
okay so look these labels are from one
 

471
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,910
okay so look these labels are from one
to n if i

472
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:53,920
to n if i
 

473
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,430
to n if i
yeah

474
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:55,440
yeah
 

475
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,509
yeah
okay okay can you yeah

476
00:09:57,509 --> 00:09:57,519
okay okay can you yeah
 

477
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:58,990
okay okay can you yeah
okay okay let's go

478
00:09:58,990 --> 00:09:59,000
okay okay let's go
 

479
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,030
okay okay let's go
[Music]

480
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:01,040
[Music]
 

481
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,520
[Music]
back okay

482
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:02,530
back okay
 

483
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:02,949
back okay
[Music]

484
00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:02,959
[Music]
 

485
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,069
[Music]
n equals g so

486
00:10:04,069 --> 00:10:04,079
n equals g so
 

487
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,590
n equals g so
minor if i uh if we we

488
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:07,600
minor if i uh if we we
 

489
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,550
minor if i uh if we we
shift this n right because if we label

490
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:10,560
shift this n right because if we label
 

491
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,750
shift this n right because if we label
this as 0 to n minus 1 right if we label

492
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:13,760
this as 0 to n minus 1 right if we label
 

493
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,069
this as 0 to n minus 1 right if we label
it and then this would be

494
00:10:16,069 --> 00:10:16,079
it and then this would be
 

495
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,590
it and then this would be
g

496
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:17,600
g
 

497
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,710
g
i and n minus i minus one and this is

498
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:20,720
i and n minus i minus one and this is
 

499
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,389
i and n minus i minus one and this is
the same thing yeah if we shift this

500
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:22,399
the same thing yeah if we shift this
 

501
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,030
the same thing yeah if we shift this
okay g i times g n minus i minus one

502
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:25,040
okay g i times g n minus i minus one
 

503
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,150
okay g i times g n minus i minus one
okay

504
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:26,160
okay
 

505
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,150
okay
so we can implement this function using

506
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:28,160
so we can implement this function using
 

507
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,990
so we can implement this function using
dynamic programming how many ways we can

okay so look remember this f n what's

526
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:55,519
okay so look remember this f n what's
 

527
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,110
okay so look remember this f n what's
this f1 equals fn minus 1 plus sn minus

let's say if i want to calculate f4 we

542
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:14,399
let's say if i want to calculate f4 we
 

543
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,230
let's say if i want to calculate f4 we
need to know which two values f3 and

544
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:18,240
need to know which two values f3 and
 

545
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,710
need to know which two values f3 and
f3 in order to calculate f3 we need to

546
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:20,720
f3 in order to calculate f3 we need to
 

547
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,750
f3 in order to calculate f3 we need to
know which value f1 and f2 f2 and f1

548
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:23,760
know which value f1 and f2 f2 and f1
 

549
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,949
know which value f1 and f2 f2 and f1
okay keep going look so look at this f2

550
00:11:26,949 --> 00:11:26,959
okay keep going look so look at this f2
 

551
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,430
okay keep going look so look at this f2
f2 are calculated multiple times so if

552
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:29,440
f2 are calculated multiple times so if
 

553
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,069
f2 are calculated multiple times so if
we're using this top down

554
00:11:32,069 --> 00:11:32,079
we're using this top down
 

555
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,150
we're using this top down
take the top down we need to use the

556
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:34,160
take the top down we need to use the
 

557
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,430
take the top down we need to use the
time uh

558
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:35,440
time uh
 

559
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,069
time uh
top dial use the recursion but in order

560
00:11:38,069 --> 00:11:38,079
top dial use the recursion but in order
 

561
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,470
top dial use the recursion but in order
to avoid calculating please over and

562
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:40,480
to avoid calculating please over and
 

563
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,470
to avoid calculating please over and
over okay what keyword should we give to

564
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:42,480
over okay what keyword should we give to
 

565
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,069
over okay what keyword should we give to
the fountain

566
00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:46,079

 

567
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,389

come on you just moved it

568
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:48,399
come on you just moved it
 

569
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,069
come on you just moved it
you just loaded

570
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:50,079
you just loaded
 

571
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,509
you just loaded
what do you mean

572
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:51,519
what do you mean
 

573
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,829
what do you mean
we need to give what what what key was

574
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:53,839
we need to give what what what key was
 

575
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,629
we need to give what what what key was
should we label the function

576
00:11:56,629 --> 00:11:56,639
should we label the function
 

577
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,030
should we label the function
so we don't calculate it

578
00:11:59,030 --> 00:11:59,040
so we don't calculate it
 

579
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,949
so we don't calculate it
yeah minimization and in this case which

580
00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:00,959
yeah minimization and in this case which
 

581
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,629
yeah minimization and in this case which
he was

582
00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:02,639
he was
 

583
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,509
he was
grow

584
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:03,519
grow
 

585
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,350
grow
come on it's there somewhere on the ball

586
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:05,360
come on it's there somewhere on the ball
 

587
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,829
come on it's there somewhere on the ball
come on cash exactly

588
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:07,839
come on cash exactly
 

589
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,990
come on cash exactly
so you're wrong why

590
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:10,000
so you're wrong why
 

591
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,110
so you're wrong why
so f2 is once calculated we save it so

592
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:13,120
so f2 is once calculated we save it so
 

593
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,110
so f2 is once calculated we save it so
next time look if f4 we're not

594
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:15,120
next time look if f4 we're not
 

595
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,310
next time look if f4 we're not
calculated at all we know f2 and then

596
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:18,320
calculated at all we know f2 and then
 

597
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,590
calculated at all we know f2 and then
when we get to f3 we need f2 again so in

598
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:21,600
when we get to f3 we need f2 again so in
 

599
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,069
when we get to f3 we need f2 again so in
do we need to kick in release f2 again

600
00:12:24,069 --> 00:12:24,079
do we need to kick in release f2 again
 

601
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,230
do we need to kick in release f2 again
no because we already catch over here so

602
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:26,240
no because we already catch over here so
 

603
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,310
no because we already catch over here so
instead we just look it up

604
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:28,320
instead we just look it up
 

605
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,389
instead we just look it up
in a notebook which is for cash yeah

606
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:30,399
in a notebook which is for cash yeah
 

607
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,870
in a notebook which is for cash yeah
let's define the cash yeah you can

608
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:32,880
let's define the cash yeah you can
 

609
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,870
let's define the cash yeah you can
implement the cash by yourself right in

610
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:34,880
implement the cash by yourself right in
 

611
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,509
implement the cash by yourself right in
the function you can check if n is in

612
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:37,519
the function you can check if n is in
 

613
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,629
the function you can check if n is in
the notebook

614
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:38,639
the notebook
 

615
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,710
the notebook
then if we see no book we just return

616
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:40,720
then if we see no book we just return
 

617
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,470
then if we see no book we just return
the one the entry in the notebook and

618
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:42,480
the one the entry in the notebook and
 

619
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,870
the one the entry in the notebook and
before we retain the function we save

620
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:44,880
before we retain the function we save
 

621
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,269
before we retain the function we save
the value in the notebook yeah like f

622
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:47,279
the value in the notebook yeah like f
 

623
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,710
the value in the notebook yeah like f
and equals

624
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:48,720
and equals
 

625
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,269
and equals
the notebook and equals fn and return

626
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:51,279
the notebook and equals fn and return
 

627
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,910
the notebook and equals fn and return
notebook n okay

628
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:53,920
notebook n okay
 

629
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,310
notebook n okay
and the button yeah bottom up is what we

630
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:56,320
and the button yeah bottom up is what we
 

631
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,870
and the button yeah bottom up is what we
calculated as zero and now we catch it

632
00:12:58,870 --> 00:12:58,880
calculated as zero and now we catch it
 

633
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,030
calculated as zero and now we catch it
f1 and based on the previous two values

634
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,040
f1 and based on the previous two values
 

635
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,550
f1 and based on the previous two values
we calculated f2 f3f24 until we reach fn

636
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:04,560
we calculated f2 f3f24 until we reach fn
 

637
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,509
we calculated f2 f3f24 until we reach fn

can you tell me what
 

727
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,189
can you tell me what
oh square is correct can you tell me

728
00:14:39,189 --> 00:14:39,199
oh square is correct can you tell me
 

729
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,269
oh square is correct can you tell me
what's one square how would we get that

730
00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:41,279
what's one square how would we get that
 

731
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,949
what's one square how would we get that
um

732
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:42,959
um
 

733
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,470
um
i didn't say it

734
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:44,480
i didn't say it
 

735
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,949
i didn't say it
well that square is correct i didn't say

736
00:14:46,949 --> 00:14:46,959
well that square is correct i didn't say
 

737
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,269
well that square is correct i didn't say
it what did you say yeah yeah yeah ryan

738
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:49,279
it what did you say yeah yeah yeah ryan
 

739
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,269
it what did you say yeah yeah yeah ryan
what why is our n square

740
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:51,279
what why is our n square
 

741
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,350
what why is our n square
because

742
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:53,360
because
 

743
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:59,590
because
how many

744
00:14:59,590 --> 00:14:59,600

 

745
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,430

yeah because we need to calculate n

746
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:01,440
yeah because we need to calculate n
 

747
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,150
yeah because we need to calculate n
values the g value how many g values we

748
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:04,160
values the g value how many g values we
 

749
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,230
values the g value how many g values we
calculate they are n right

750
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:06,240
calculate they are n right
 

751
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,550
calculate they are n right
and for each one we need to give a loop

752
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:08,560
and for each one we need to give a loop
 

753
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,870
and for each one we need to give a loop
so let's n g n squared and n squared

754
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:10,880
so let's n g n squared and n squared
 

755
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,350
so let's n g n squared and n squared
what's our space complexity n

756
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:13,360
what's our space complexity n
 

757
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,110
what's our space complexity n
yeah we're done why

758
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:15,120
yeah we're done why
 

759
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,629
yeah we're done why
how many n values are we how many

760
00:15:18,629 --> 00:15:18,639
how many n values are we how many
 

761
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:19,750
how many n values are we how many

one o n is correct why is it ln
 

765
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,189
one o n is correct why is it ln
how many g values do we need to

766
00:15:25,189 --> 00:15:25,199
how many g values do we need to
 

767
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,590
how many g values do we need to
calculate one

768
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:27,600
calculate one
 

769
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,590

it means that um

830
00:16:37,189 --> 00:16:37,199
it means that um
 

831
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,069
it means that um
zero times n plus one is zero

832
00:16:40,069 --> 00:16:40,079
zero times n plus one is zero
 

833
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,389
zero times n plus one is zero
no no no no it's if this i talked about

this before remember this this is the
 

837
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,269
this before remember this this is the
list of n plus one element so each one

838
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:47,279
list of n plus one element so each one
 

839
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,069
list of n plus one element so each one
is zero yeah that's the least yeah i

840
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:50,079
is zero yeah that's the least yeah i
 

841
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,389
is zero yeah that's the least yeah i
meant that yeah okay

842
00:16:52,389 --> 00:16:52,399
meant that yeah okay
 

843
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,030
meant that yeah okay
so now the first one is g zero equals

844
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:55,040
so now the first one is g zero equals
 

845
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,350
so now the first one is g zero equals
one

846
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:57,360

 

847
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,389

g zero

848
00:16:58,389 --> 00:16:58,399
g zero
 

849
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:59,269
g zero
um

850
00:16:59,269 --> 00:16:59,279
um
 

851
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,310
um
g one g zero equals one

852
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:02,320
g one g zero equals one
 

853
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,870
g one g zero equals one
what value what value i'm giving it

854
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:04,880
what value what value i'm giving it
 

855
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,510
what value what value i'm giving it
one one yes

856
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:07,520
one one yes
 

857
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,949
one one yes
now we just need to iterate for i in

858
00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:10,959
now we just need to iterate for i in
 

859
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:11,800
now we just need to iterate for i in
range

860
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:11,810
range
 

861
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:12,949
range
[Music]

862
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:12,959
[Music]
 

863
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,270
[Music]
m plus one and then

864
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:15,280
m plus one and then
 

865
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,590
m plus one and then
i now i is the

866
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:17,600
i now i is the
 

867
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,150
i now i is the
the number of nodes the number of nodes

868
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:20,160
the number of nodes the number of nodes
 

869
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,909
the number of nodes the number of nodes
yeah and then four

870
00:17:21,909 --> 00:17:21,919
yeah and then four
 

871
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,350
yeah and then four
for j

872
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:23,360
for j
 

873
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,230
for j
in range range i

874
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:26,240
in range range i
 

875
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,429
in range range i
range i

876
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:27,439
range i
 

877
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,029
range i
so now we can say g

878
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:31,039

 

879
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:36,630

j plus equals uh no no no g i plus

880
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:36,640
j plus equals uh no no no g i plus
 

881
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,510
j plus equals uh no no no g i plus
equals gj

882
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:39,520
equals gj
 

883
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,430
equals gj
times g

884
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:41,440
times g
 

885
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,029
times g
what i minus j minus one okay

886
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:45,039
what i minus j minus one okay
 

887
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,110
what i minus j minus one okay
so it's a bit harder to understand in

888
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:47,120
so it's a bit harder to understand in
 

889
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,630
so it's a bit harder to understand in
this case

890
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:48,640
this case
 

891
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,549
this case
yeah because but

892
00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:50,559
yeah because but
 

893
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,070
yeah because but
look i i

894
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:52,080
look i i
 

895
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,150
look i i
in the loop the first loop is the number

896
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:54,160
in the loop the first loop is the number
 

897
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,029
in the loop the first loop is the number
of the notes the number of notes and the

898
00:17:57,029 --> 00:17:57,039
of the notes the number of notes and the
 

899
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,150
of the notes the number of notes and the
second loop is saying that which which

900
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:00,160
second loop is saying that which which
 

901
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,470
second loop is saying that which which
load which is going to be the root okay

902
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:02,480
load which is going to be the root okay
 

903
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,590
load which is going to be the root okay
which is going to be the loop so gi the

904
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:05,600
which is going to be the loop so gi the
 

905
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,870
which is going to be the loop so gi the
answer of gi would be equals to one

906
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:08,880
answer of gi would be equals to one
 

907
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,510
answer of gi would be equals to one
i place the gj and then i price this is

908
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:11,520
i place the gj and then i price this is
 

909
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,190
i place the gj and then i price this is
the formula right and then finally i

910
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:13,200
the formula right and then finally i
 

911
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,549
the formula right and then finally i
return return gn right this is uh an

912
00:18:16,549 --> 00:18:16,559
return return gn right this is uh an
 

913
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,150
return return gn right this is uh an
answer we're looking for what's the time

914
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:18,160
answer we're looking for what's the time
 

915
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,750
answer we're looking for what's the time
complexity if you're looking this for

916
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:19,760
complexity if you're looking this for
 

917
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,510
complexity if you're looking this for
loop come on

918
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:21,520
loop come on
 

919
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,270
loop come on
how many for loops

920
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:23,280
how many for loops
 

921
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,029
how many for loops
um

922
00:18:25,029 --> 00:18:25,039
um
 

923
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:29,909
um
so what's the terminal

924
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:29,919

 

925
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,350

roughly one square divided by two

926
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:31,360
roughly one square divided by two
 

927
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,430
roughly one square divided by two
because the j the second inner loop j

928
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:33,440
because the j the second inner loop j
 

929
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,990
because the j the second inner loop j
goes to up to n it doesn't go go to n

930
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:36,000
goes to up to n it doesn't go go to n
 

931
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,390
goes to up to n it doesn't go go to n
right go to the i it doesn't go to the

932
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:38,400
right go to the i it doesn't go to the
 

933
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,789
right go to the i it doesn't go to the
end so it's roughly and square divided

934
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:40,799
end so it's roughly and square divided
 

935
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,110
end so it's roughly and square divided
by two of our job constant okay what's

936
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:43,120
by two of our job constant okay what's
 

937
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,350
by two of our job constant okay what's
the space complexity here

938
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:45,360
the space complexity here
 

939
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,110
the space complexity here
come on it's very easy

940
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:47,120
come on it's very easy
 

941
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,630
come on it's very easy
all right you see so the butter up

942
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:50,640
all right you see so the butter up
 

943
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,950
all right you see so the butter up
if we look at the code the butter up we

944
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:52,960
if we look at the code the butter up we
 

945
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,029
if we look at the code the butter up we
can easily see that space and time

946
00:18:55,029 --> 00:18:55,039
can easily see that space and time
 

947
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,029
can easily see that space and time
complexity yeah because it is easier to

948
00:18:57,029 --> 00:18:57,039
complexity yeah because it is easier to
 

949
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,350
complexity yeah because it is easier to
understand but for the top down we are

950
00:18:59,350 --> 00:18:59,360
understand but for the top down we are
 

951
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,350
understand but for the top down we are
using recursion so you need to think

952
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:01,360
using recursion so you need to think
 

953
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,110
using recursion so you need to think
about it right but

954
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:03,120
about it right but
 

955
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,270
about it right but
both solutions give the same

956
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:05,280
both solutions give the same
 

957
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,270
both solutions give the same
time complexity and space complexity

958
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:07,280
time complexity and space complexity
 

959
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,150
time complexity and space complexity
okay

960
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:08,160
okay
 

961
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,110
okay
yeah

962
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:09,120
yeah
 

963
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,110
yeah
okay so this is pretty much the today

964
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:11,120
okay so this is pretty much the today
 

965
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,430
okay so this is pretty much the today
but today we're going to talk about

966
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:13,440
but today we're going to talk about
 

967
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,150
but today we're going to talk about
uh actually this is a very interesting

968
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:16,160
uh actually this is a very interesting
 

969

question and many other similar problems
okay so what's canon numbers so

984
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:39,760
okay so what's canon numbers so
 

985
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,029
okay so what's canon numbers so
continuous numbers okay let's call it g

g n equals 1 equals

988
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:47,679

 

989
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:52,870

equals m plus 1 1 c 2 n c it might be

990
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:52,880
equals m plus 1 1 c 2 n c it might be
 

991
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,789
equals m plus 1 1 c 2 n c it might be
right so m

992
00:19:54,789 --> 00:19:54,799
right so m
 

993
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,190
right so m

that three two three apples i want to

1016
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:26,640
that three two three apples i want to
 

1017
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,470
that three two three apples i want to
pick two apples how many ways three

1018
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:28,480
pick two apples how many ways three
 

1019
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,270
pick two apples how many ways three
three

1020
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:29,280
three
 

1021
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,110
three
it's the same as three three one right

1022
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:33,120
it's the same as three three one right
 

1023
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,870
it's the same as three three one right
it's the same as picking one apples out

1024
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:34,880
it's the same as picking one apples out
 

1025
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,149
it's the same as picking one apples out
of three because look every time you

1026
00:20:36,149 --> 00:20:36,159
of three because look every time you
 

1027
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,230
of three because look every time you
pick two apples you also

1028
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:38,240
pick two apples you also
 

1029
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,070
pick two apples you also
have a solution for picking one apples

1030
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:40,080
have a solution for picking one apples
 

1031
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,909
have a solution for picking one apples
right so this is c2n times n let's let's

1032
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:43,919
right so this is c2n times n let's let's
 

1033
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,830
right so this is c2n times n let's let's
let's check this if

1034
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:46,840

 

1035
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:53,270

g g3 okay t3 is equal to three plus one

1036
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:53,280
g g3 okay t3 is equal to three plus one
 

1037
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,710
g g3 okay t3 is equal to three plus one
and c

1038
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:54,720
and c
 

1039
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,190
and c
two times three and three okay so what's

1040
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:57,200
two times three and three okay so what's
 

1041
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,590
two times three and three okay so what's
this under four times one

1042
00:20:59,590 --> 00:20:59,600
this under four times one
 

1043
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,830
this under four times one
c six

1044
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:00,840
c six
 

1045
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,830
c six
three what's this number six times five

1046
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:03,840
three what's this number six times five
 

1047
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,510
three what's this number six times five
times four and three times two times one

1048
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:07,520
times four and three times two times one
 

1049
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,510
times four and three times two times one
and then we have a four

1050
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:09,520
and then we have a four
 

1051
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,110
and then we have a four
okay so these

1052
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:11,120
okay so these
 

1053
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,549
okay so these
cancel out

1054
00:21:12,549 --> 00:21:12,559
cancel out
 

1055
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,830
cancel out
these cancel out look what do we have

1056
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:14,840
these cancel out look what do we have
 

1057
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,830
these cancel out look what do we have
now look eric look

1058
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:17,840
now look eric look
 

1059
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,350
now look eric look
come on yeah

1060
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:19,360
come on yeah
 

1061
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,310
come on yeah
what's the answer of this

1062
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:22,320
what's the answer of this
 

1063
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,710
what's the answer of this
g3 will be equals to five look we just

1064
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:24,720
g3 will be equals to five look we just
 

1065
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,270
g3 will be equals to five look we just
cancel out everything except the five so

1066
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:27,280
cancel out everything except the five so
 

1067
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,789
cancel out everything except the five so
this is the catenal numbers okay n plus

1068
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:30,799
this is the catenal numbers okay n plus
 

1069
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,789
this is the catenal numbers okay n plus
one c two and n

1070
00:21:32,789 --> 00:21:32,799
one c two and n
 

1071
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,950
one c two and n
and then it has the recursion uh

1072
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:34,960
and then it has the recursion uh
 

1073
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,590
and then it has the recursion uh
depending on the previous one g n plus

1074
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:37,600
depending on the previous one g n plus
 

1075
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,549
depending on the previous one g n plus
one

1076
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:38,559
one
 

1077
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:42,830
one
equals equals one equals the

1078
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:42,840
equals equals one equals the
 

1079
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,470
equals equals one equals the
two

1080
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:44,480

and i i think it's it i'm not sure i
have to check it out

1092
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:54,080
have to check it out
 

1093
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,669
have to check it out
i have to look it up

1094
00:21:57,669 --> 00:21:57,679

so that would be if you know if if we
 

1105
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,070
so that would be if you know if if we
have this function

1106
