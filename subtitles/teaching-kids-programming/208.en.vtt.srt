00:00:03,429 --> 00:00:03,439
oh hey hi
 

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,309
oh hey hi
hello me sorry mr ryan how are you today

4
00:00:06,309 --> 00:00:06,319
hello me sorry mr ryan how are you today
 

5
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:08,230
hello me sorry mr ryan how are you today
okay so we talk about the binary tree

6
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:08,240
okay so we talk about the binary tree
 

7
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,509
okay so we talk about the binary tree
and we have a different

8
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:09,519
and we have a different
 

9
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,110
and we have a different
uh traversal algorithm okay

10
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:13,120
uh traversal algorithm okay
 

11
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,550
uh traversal algorithm okay
so let's say one two

12
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:16,560
so let's say one two
 

13
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,590
so let's say one two
three four this is about three yeah

14
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:19,600
three four this is about three yeah
 

15
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,910
three four this is about three yeah
five six seven

16
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:23,920
five six seven
 

17
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,710
five six seven
what's the pre-order one two three five

18
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:26,720
what's the pre-order one two three five
 

19
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,109
what's the pre-order one two three five
four

20
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:27,119
four
 

21
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,109
four
and then one two three four five six

22
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:29,119
and then one two three four five six
 

23
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,029
and then one two three four five six
seven so preorder is

24
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:31,039
seven so preorder is
 

25
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,630
seven so preorder is
not left right

26
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:34,640

 

27
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,310

four five six seven yeah what's in order

28
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:38,320
four five six seven yeah what's in order
 

29
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,670
four five six seven yeah what's in order
now three two four

30
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:41,680
now three two four
 

31
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:56,790
now three two four
one six five

32
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:56,800

 

33
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,150

okay what's the point for such order

34
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:00,160
okay what's the point for such order
 

35
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,710
okay what's the point for such order
one two five three four six seven

36
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:02,720

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,230
okay so in order yeah
it's one way to remember that is that

46
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:14,240
it's one way to remember that is that
 

47
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,270
it's one way to remember that is that
the node

48
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:15,280
the node
 

49
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,550
the node
is visited in the middle yeah yeah i

50
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:18,560
is visited in the middle yeah yeah i
 

51
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,670
is visited in the middle yeah yeah i
knew that another one is air

52
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:21,680
knew that another one is air
 

53
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,830
knew that another one is air
is ah and air what's what does it call

57
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,030
it
over like reverse in order so can you

58
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:29,040
over like reverse in order so can you
 

59
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,789
over like reverse in order so can you
tell me what's reversed in order

60
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:30,799
tell me what's reversed in order
 

61
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,910
tell me what's reversed in order
we're back in order yeah that

we can recursively travel the left tree
 

87
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,150
we can recursively travel the left tree

visit the left tree and what happened
 

101
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,949
visit the left tree and what happened
what happened then and then we

00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:04,959
what happened then and then we
 

103
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,309

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,630
look what's in order left no
right we visited the left tree then we

00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:14,640
right we visited the left tree then we
 

111
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,390
right we visited the left tree then we
visited the night

depending if you want to return the list
 

117
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,470
depending if you want to return the list
of notes or the list of

of notes or the list of
 

119
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:53,310

129
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:20,469

recursion and let's just stack yeah we

130
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:20,479
recursion and let's just stack yeah we
 

131
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:22,870
recursion and let's just stack yeah we
use the stack okay so

132
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:22,880
use the stack okay so
 

133
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,670
use the stack okay so
we're going back anywhere that's that's

134
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:25,680
we're going back anywhere that's that's
 

135
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,790
we're going back anywhere that's that's
good question yeah

136
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:26,800
good question yeah
 

137
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,110
good question yeah
because the recursion the computer

138
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:29,120
because the recursion the computer
 

139
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,230
because the recursion the computer
maintain a stack for you but we can also

140
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:32,240
maintain a stack for you but we can also
 

141
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,070
maintain a stack for you but we can also
we can we can implement these

142
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:36,080
we can we can implement these
 

143
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,150
we can we can implement these
using iterator of course by using a

144
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:38,160
using iterator of course by using a
 

145
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,350
using iterator of course by using a
stack okay so how do we do this

146
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:43,360

 

147
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,590

it's like uh what if we we just put one

166
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:12,000
it's like uh what if we we just put one
 

167

in
 

169
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,110
in
first is burst out okay

so what if you just put one in the
segment

174
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:20,639
segment
 

175
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,790
segment
and then you take it out until we first

176
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:22,800
and then you take it out until we first
 

177
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,670
and then you take it out until we first
get it

178
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:23,680
get it
 

179
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,670
get it
okay okay come on listen

180
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:27,680

 

181
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,430

how do we use the stack to solve this

182
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:29,440
how do we use the stack to solve this
 

183
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,790
how do we use the stack to solve this
problem uh uh

184
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:30,800
problem uh uh
 

185
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,150
problem uh uh
in order okay so stack okay so

186
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:34,160
in order okay so stack okay so
 

187
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,590
in order okay so stack okay so
we have a stack and we have a current

188
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:37,600
we have a stack and we have a current
 

189
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,909
we have a stack and we have a current
current thingy okay current variable you

190
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:39,919
current thingy okay current variable you
 

191
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,749
current thingy okay current variable you
have to keep the current node the node

192
00:05:41,749 --> 00:05:41,759
have to keep the current node the node
 

193
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,110
have to keep the current node the node
we are visiting

194
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:43,120
we are visiting
 

195
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,909
we are visiting
so what do we do we put that current

196
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:45,919
so what do we do we put that current
 

197
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:46,870
so what do we do we put that current
equals load

198
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:46,880
equals load
 

199
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,590
equals load
now current equals root okay so we put a

200
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:49,600
now current equals root okay so we put a
 

201
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,670
now current equals root okay so we put a
one here

202
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:51,680
one here
 

203
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,189
one here
yeah and then we keep put putting the

204
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:55,199
yeah and then we keep put putting the
 

205
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:55,670
yeah and then we keep put putting the
left

206
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:55,680
left
 

207
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,110
left
if possible what's left what's on left

208
00:05:59,110 --> 00:05:59,120
if possible what's left what's on left
 

209
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,390
if possible what's left what's on left
keep going no no no too far five is not

210
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:02,400
keep going no no no too far five is not
 

211
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,469
keep going no no no too far five is not
on the left we keep going okay so we put

212
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:04,479
on the left we keep going okay so we put
 

213
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:05,350
on the left we keep going okay so we put
a two here we

214
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:05,360
a two here we
 

215
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,830
a two here we
put a four four here okay and

216
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:09,840
put a four four here okay and
 

217
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,950
put a four four here okay and
and then what should we do now we should

218
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:12,960
and then what should we do now we should
 

219
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,830
and then what should we do now we should
read it we should take it out take this

220
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:15,840
read it we should take it out take this
 

221
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,790
read it we should take it out take this
four out

222
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:16,800
four out
 

223
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,749
four out
okay we take this for us so the answer

224
00:06:19,749 --> 00:06:19,759
okay we take this for us so the answer
 

225
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:19,990
okay we take this for us so the answer
is

226
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:20,000
is
 

227
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,110
is
four here yeah take a four hours and

228
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:23,120
four here yeah take a four hours and
 

229
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,790
four here yeah take a four hours and
then we

230
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:24,800
then we
 

231
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,230
then we
and we what do we do

and we what do we do
right go to the right okay

234
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:32,479
right go to the right okay
 

235
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,270
right go to the right okay
what should we do now we go to we we

236
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:35,280
what should we do now we go to we we
 

237
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,870
what should we do now we go to we we
take these four out

238
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:36,880
take these four out
 

239
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,510
take these four out
yeah i'm putting me on so we put in the

240
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:39,520
yeah i'm putting me on so we put in the
 

241
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,309
yeah i'm putting me on so we put in the
answer

242
00:06:42,309 --> 00:06:42,319

 

243
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,430

and what uh what's next what's next

244
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:45,440
and what uh what's next what's next
 

245
00:06:45,440 --> 00:07:01,029
and what uh what's next what's next
should we do

246
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:01,039

 

247
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,469

on right left when you push this one

248
00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:04,479
on right left when you push this one
 

249
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,390
on right left when you push this one
uh we push this one two four

250
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:08,400
uh we push this one two four
 

251
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,270
uh we push this one two four
and then we take these four out we take

252
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:11,280
and then we take these four out we take
 

253
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,870
and then we take these four out we take
this four out what's that

254
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:12,880
this four out what's that
 

255
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,790
this four out what's that
next what what's the what's the fall

256
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:16,800
next what what's the what's the fall
 

257
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,150
next what what's the what's the fall
fourth one isn't the answer yeah four is

258
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:20,160
fourth one isn't the answer yeah four is
 

259
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,270
fourth one isn't the answer yeah four is
really nice but

260
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:21,280
really nice but
 

261
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,510
really nice but
four doesn't have a right right doesn't

262
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:23,520
four doesn't have a right right doesn't
 

263
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,430
four doesn't have a right right doesn't
have a right

264
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:25,440
have a right
 

265
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,469
have a right
yeah so again we take these two out

266
00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:30,479
yeah so again we take these two out
 

267
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,510
yeah so again we take these two out
two out and then the one out

268
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:33,520
two out and then the one out
 

269
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,629
two out and then the one out
take this two out and then we uh

270
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:36,639
take this two out and then we uh
 

271
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,469
take this two out and then we uh
no no no we put it nice and we take them

272
00:07:40,469 --> 00:07:40,479
no no no we put it nice and we take them
 

273
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:41,350
no no no we put it nice and we take them
it's right

274
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:41,360
it's right
 

275
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,469
it's right
which is what right is one five five

276
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:44,479
which is what right is one five five
 

277
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,510
which is what right is one five five
five yeah and then five

278
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:47,520
five yeah and then five
 

279
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,550
five yeah and then five
but five easy has a left left note

280
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:50,560
but five easy has a left left note
 

281
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,189
but five easy has a left left note
it doesn't have so i i don't put i i

282
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:53,199
it doesn't have so i i don't put i i

five out

288
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:57,120
five out
 

289
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,469
five out
and then what's next we we shall

290
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:00,479
and then what's next we we shall
 

291
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,990
and then what's next we we shall
we take one out yeah it will make three

292
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:04,000
we take one out yeah it will make three
 

293
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,790
we take one out yeah it will make three
we take one out and we go to the right

294
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:06,800
we take one out and we go to the right
 

295
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,510
we take one out and we go to the right
yeah

296
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:07,520
yeah
 

297
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,469
yeah
so basically go to the right three yeah

298
00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:10,479
so basically go to the right three yeah
 

299
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:11,510
so basically go to the right three yeah
we go to the

300
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:11,520
we go to the
 

301
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,589
we go to the
three and then we push it's left in

302
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:13,599
three and then we push it's left in
 

303
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,270
three and then we push it's left in
there

304
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:15,280
there
 

305
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,430

and then we what uh uh actually we need
 

309
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,950
and then we what uh uh actually we need
to push the three in

310
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:22,960
to push the three in
 

311
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,230
to push the three in
right we turn the three in and and

312
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:26,240
right we turn the three in and and
 

313
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,510
right we turn the three in and and
put the six we take the six we take the

314
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:29,520
put the six we take the six we take the
 

315
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,189
put the six we take the six we take the
three we go to the right

316
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:31,199
three we go to the right
 

317
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,389
three we go to the right
and then which is seven okay you forgot

318
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:34,399
and then which is seven okay you forgot
 

319
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,750
and then which is seven okay you forgot
to pick six

320
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:35,760
to pick six
 

321
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:44,949
to pick six
yeah in the list four

322
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:44,959

 

323
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,230

three seven
 

341
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,070
three seven
okay so listen listen

342
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:14,080
okay so listen listen
 

343
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,430
okay so listen listen
listen the approach is that we keep

344
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:17,440
listen the approach is that we keep
 

345
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,870
listen the approach is that we keep
pushing the left

346
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:18,880
pushing the left
 

347
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:25,780
pushing the left
note if possible

348
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:25,790

351
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,870

yeah then we go to the right okay that's

352
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:42,880
yeah then we go to the right okay that's
 

353
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,110
yeah then we go to the right okay that's
a bit of we push the left nose

354
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:45,120
a bit of we push the left nose
 

355
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,070
a bit of we push the left nose
as many as we want and then if we can't

356
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:48,080
as many as we want and then if we can't
 

357
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,350
as many as we want and then if we can't
push the left we

358
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:49,360
push the left we
 

359
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,630
push the left we
pocket one we pop one from the

360
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:52,640
pocket one we pop one from the
 

361
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,990
pocket one we pop one from the
stack we pop one that's from the stack

362
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:56,000
stack we pop one that's from the stack
 

363
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,230
stack we pop one that's from the stack
we put it in the answer yeah

364
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:58,240
we put it in the answer yeah
 

365
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,430
we put it in the answer yeah
and then we go to the right

366
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:01,440
and then we go to the right
 

367
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,470
and then we go to the right
okay we go to the right okay does that

368
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:04,480
okay we go to the right okay does that
 

369
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,069
okay we go to the right okay does that
make sense

370
00:10:06,069 --> 00:10:06,079
make sense
 

371
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,310
make sense
let me write a code okay so so you

372
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:08,320
let me write a code okay so so you
 

373
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,590
let me write a code okay so so you
understand because it's better to

374
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:09,600
understand because it's better to
 

375
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,710
understand because it's better to
explain with the code

376
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:10,720
explain with the code
 

377
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:30,230
explain with the code
define fine in order

00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:30,240

 

379
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,470

and then now we have a step step in a

380
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:32,480
and then now we have a step step in a
 

381
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,230
and then now we have a step step in a
cell in python

382
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:34,240
cell in python
 

383
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,910
cell in python
what kind of data structure are we used

384
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:35,920
what kind of data structure are we used
 

385
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,509
what kind of data structure are we used

i will set it to the beginning of route

396
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:00,320
i will set it to the beginning of route
 

397
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,190
i will set it to the beginning of route
and answer

398

and answer
 

399
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,310
and answer
i will have equals to the empty days

okay now why okay while your current
 

405
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:20,150
okay now why okay while your current
is not empty or the stack is

406
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:20,160

 

407
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,949

then i push it i put a stack put a left

408
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:22,959
then i push it i put a stack put a left
 

409
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,790
then i push it i put a stack put a left
into the stack okay so s t

410
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:24,800
into the stack okay so s t
 

411
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,590
into the stack okay so s t

as we want to put it in the stack
 

449
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,990

all right this makes sense yeah yeah and
 

451
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,670
all right this makes sense yeah yeah and
then we now we currently

then we now we currently
 

453
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,110
then we now we currently
we equal the pop we take one

454
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:21,120
we equal the pop we take one
 

455
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,470
we equal the pop we take one
we take one from the top right

we take one from the top right
 

457
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,629
we take one from the top right
yeah this is four and i put it into the

00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:26,639
yeah this is four and i put it into the
 

459
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,030
yeah this is four and i put it into the
answer answer don't append one

460
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:29,040
answer answer don't append one
 

461

i take current is what color is now

i take current is what color is now
 

471
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,590
i take current is what color is now
so it doesn't do this and then you go

472
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:05,600
so it doesn't do this and then you go
 

473
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,990
so it doesn't do this and then you go
pop again which is two

474
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,000
pop again which is two
 

475
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,190
pop again which is two
right and then two's right it will be

476
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:11,200
right and then two's right it will be
 

477
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,310
right and then two's right it will be
five everybody

i'm pushing the nose if if the left in

512
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:19,680
i'm pushing the nose if if the left in
 

513
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,949
i'm pushing the nose if if the left in
the current node

514
00:14:20,949 --> 00:14:20,959
the current node
 

515
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,030
the current node
look if a camera now is not empty we try

516
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,040
look if a camera now is not empty we try
 

517
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,150
look if a camera now is not empty we try
to go to the left and push it into the

518
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:26,160
to go to the left and push it into the
 

519
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,069
to go to the left and push it into the
stack and after that we take one from

520
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:30,079
stack and after that we take one from
 

521
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,430
stack and after that we take one from
the top of stack

522
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:31,440
the top of stack
 

523
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,710
the top of stack
to the bottom and then this is the uh

524
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:34,720
to the bottom and then this is the uh
 

525
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,030
to the bottom and then this is the uh
the

526
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:35,040
the
 

527
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,750
the
answer will put uh i will put this

528
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:37,760
answer will put uh i will put this
 

529
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,310
answer will put uh i will put this
append

530
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:38,320
append
 

531
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,230
append
the current note into the answer that's

532
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:40,240
the current note into the answer that's
 

533
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,230
the current note into the answer that's
and then we go to the right yeah why we

534
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:42,240
and then we go to the right yeah why we
 

535
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,590
and then we go to the right yeah why we
need to go to the right

536
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:43,600
need to go to the right
 

537
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,990
need to go to the right
oh because we can't be going to the left

538
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:46,000
oh because we can't be going to the left
 

539
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,790
oh because we can't be going to the left
anymore

540
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:46,800
anymore
 

541
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,310
anymore
because the left already in the stack

542
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:50,320
because the left already in the stack
 

543
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:50,629
because the left already in the stack
right

544
00:14:50,629 --> 00:14:50,639
right
 

545
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,710
right
we push the left tree in a step we take

546
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:52,720
we push the left tree in a step we take
 

547
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,670
we push the left tree in a step we take
it out

548
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:53,680
it out
 

549
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,470
it out
we take it out and then this node will

550
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:56,480
we take it out and then this node will
 

551
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,189
we take it out and then this node will
be the root

552
00:14:57,189 --> 00:14:57,199
be the root
 

553
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,150
be the root
note and then we we visit the right tree

554
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:00,160
note and then we we visit the right tree
 

555
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:00,790
note and then we we visit the right tree
yeah

556
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:00,800
yeah
 

557
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,269
yeah
