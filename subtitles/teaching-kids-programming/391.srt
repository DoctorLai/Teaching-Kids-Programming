1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
oh hello

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:06,399
hello mr mr ryan hi ryan

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,400
okay we have been talking about tic tac

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:09,679
toe for two days yeah but we haven't

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,599
talked about

6
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,880
actually the strategy to play a

7
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,000
tic-tac-toe

8
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,039
game you know as a computer right so

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,960
human

10
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,199
as a human how do you play the title

11
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,400
come on if you want to play what's your

12
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,359
strategy

13
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,519
um you if you get to um

14
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,519
okay

15
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,559
okay so the agent is the we talk about

16
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,320
this agent and then the class is the

17
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:36,160
opponent okay

18
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,719
wait so it's

19
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,719
like every agent gets sick first yeah

20
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,840
okay so first possibility to win okay so

21
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,280
yeah

22
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,760
and then what's next okay so what's your

23
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,680
strategy right and then and then the

24
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:55,039
opponent either

25
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,879
put only camper around where yeah yeah

26
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,199
and then it doesn't really actually

27
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,640
matter okay so don't pick one come on

28
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,239
it's like you're playing different with

29
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,000
the right hand okay now you're playing

30
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,819
the cross so what are you going to put

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,400
here

32
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:08,799
[Music]

33
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,799
anyway

34
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,600
there's actually a big difference okay

35
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,439
look

36
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,960
this there's only one center it's like a

37
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,119
little bikini you have one center but

38
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,799
look this is the inner meter this is the

39
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,360
corner so which one you prefer the

40
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:24,240
corner or the middle

41
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,840
five middle five middle

42
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,079
you sure not the corner

43
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,240
corner corner is better right because

44
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,079
look you have two chances of winning

45
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,600
here but we start

46
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,520
with the cross remember we are playing

47
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,280
the opponent here

48
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,280
you only have one right because this one

49
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,880
is already broke right

50
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,680
there's no it's not possible for at

51
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,560
least to win that's uh but for if i put

52
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,720
it here

53
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,119
i might have two

54
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,360
two possibilities in the future if i

55
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:57,840
play in the middle

56
00:01:53,360 --> 00:02:00,560
i only have one possibility why okay

57
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,920
i don't really like to win everything is

58
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,600
i just don't want the payment to win

59
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,600
okay that's a very interesting thought

60
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,039
you don't want the opponent to win i

61
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,080
don't like to win but you just don't

62
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:14,720
like opponent to win yes but then

63
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,879
okay yeah so that's kind of strategy yes

64
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,640
yes but that talk

65
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,560
you don't want the opponent to win that

66
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,120
means that you need to win sometimes

67
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:27,360
yeah yeah and the thing is i don't

68
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:29,920
really um i ideally go with winning i

69
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,239
normally focus on the employments um

70
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,120
well now okay yeah yeah that's very good

71
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,040
that's very creative that's good okay so

72
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,840
i understand okay so now there are two

73
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,000
strategies here so first of all is to

74
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,959
occupy the center because that gives us

75
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,720
more flexibility in the future for for

76
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,360
example if we put in the middle

77
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,519
then we have look enough we have how

78
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,680
many choice one two

79
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,920
three four four choice four possibility

80
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,840
in the future okay so as an opponent

81
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,519
then i will occupy the corner because

82
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,680
that gives us more

83
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,920
choice okay what's next

84
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,040
your cross you're paying me agent what's

85
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,560
next

86
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,840
ryan what would you put the next across

87
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,480
what would you put

88
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,800
i would put it on down

89
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,800
yeah yeah which one

90
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,800
um

91
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,440
where

92
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,400
where which one here

93
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,319
here or here or here yeah you only have

94
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,040
one two three four five six seven seven

95
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,040
choices pick one

96
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:38,080
bottom left corner okay what why is that

97
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,000
this is because you also have a chance

98
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,840
of winning but you're also blocking

99
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
where okay so that's what that's very

100
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,159
good so here

101
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,720
we have two choice of winning and we are

102
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,319
blocking this one right okay okay and

103
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,640
then what's next

104
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,239
there's a cup left

105
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,840
you put it in the

106
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,920
top right corner because

107
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,599
yeah because look if i don't put it then

108
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,720
i will lose yeah right that's very

109
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,560
obvious okay and then i'll cross

110
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,560
you put it in the top

111
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,159
yeah yeah again if i don't put it down

112
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,040
then i will lose right

113
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,720
okay and then obviously here right

114
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,959
if i don't put it loose i know what's

115
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,959
next

116
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:21,759
i'll put it in the

117
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,600
left yeah

118
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,600
right right right

119
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,639
why is that why why this world for this

120
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,040
one

121
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,040
because

122
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,960
it doesn't matter right it doesn't

123
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,400
matter at this point because they

124
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,919
yeah you have to put blocky there

125
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,919
otherwise you'll lose okay and then

126
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,600
if we play smart

127
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,919
intelligently the best result you can

128
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,800
get is the draw if you play with the

129
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:13,919
computer it's always a draw yeah there's

130
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,160
no chance you can win the computer

131
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,600
because this game is so small and then

132
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,280
possibilities

133
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,639
the number of possibilities we can just

134
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,800
compute

135
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,639
how many possibilities for this state if

136
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,880
we are talking about the state there are

137
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,479
there are how many squares are there

138
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,840
how many squares

139
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,840
um

140
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,720
nice square okay for nine squares each

141
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,840
one how many possibilities do we have

142
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,880
for this

143
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,039
one two three

144
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,440
how many possibilities for occupying the

145
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,720
state of each square

146
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,440
how many states

147
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,440
how many states

148
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,320
the cross the circle

149
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,400
there are three states for each one so

150
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,639
how many states are there for a grade

151
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,960
for for the t center

152
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,759
come on each one has three possibilities

153
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:07,120
so there are nine of them so what's the

154
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,479
the total number of states how many

155
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,520
three

156
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:13,840
three three so i multiplied seven three

157
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,120
to the power of nine right because each

158
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,199
one i have three

159
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,840
possibilities cross certain and

160
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,479
unoccupied so the number of the state is

161
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,319
3 to the power of 9. this is actually a

162
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:27,360
very small number okay i don't know but

163
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,360
it's a very small number

164
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,800
what's the power of 3 to the power of 9

165
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,639
okay

166
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,720
let me just calculate it what's the

167
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,400
power of three to the nine

168
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,680
huh what's the power of three to the

169
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,759
nine

170
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:43,280
three to the nine

171
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:47,280
is one six one one nine six eight three

172
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:49,759
okay so it's one nine six eight yeah

173
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,919
this is the total number of states yeah

174
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,000
so look this is so small that uh we can

175
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,759
just use the computer to prove using it

176
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,160
okay yeah

177
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,599
yeah we can just try each possibilities

178
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,080
and i know that

179
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:04,720
that's why this game is

180
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,599
i mean the best you can get is a

181
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,400
a a draw okay so

182
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:12,240
so to sum up the the strategy you follow

183
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,520
is what okay so let me write it down

184
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,880
okay so

185
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:19,280
first of all we prefer the meter

186
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:22,080
we found the meter if there is a center

187
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,360
available we prefer the center okay

188
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,639
the next one

189
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,560
is what

190
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,599
if

191
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:32,319
okay so the next one is what if

192
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:35,280
if the opponent is winning if the

193
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,800
opponent next winning is paid for uh us

194
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,080
by placing us

195
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,080
you know

196
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:43,680
in the squad then we need to occupy that

197
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:45,840
one right yeah so if opponent is winning

198
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,840
um

199
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,879
okay the thing is that look

200
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,879
so we probably should move this the

201
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:56,639
second to the first one right

202
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:59,280
right why why is that look if the

203
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:02,160
if the thing is that

204
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,400
okay so if the thing is that uh okay so

205
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,400
now

206
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:10,080
now

207
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,080
would you prefer the center on here

208
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:14,569
[Music]

209
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:30,560
so you see this this rules is not always

210
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,120
true right this is there's an exception

211
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,599
all right yeah there's an exception so

212
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,000
this is called the the rules so we we

213
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,200
can implement these rules this is kind

214
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,399
of strategy

215
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,560
which we can implement

216
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,560
that

217
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,839
we can implement the strategy as the

218
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,480
function rules so how does that work so

219
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,480
look like we can say okay

220
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,160
this is a tree this is a decision tree

221
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,320
we call it decision tree okay so we are

222
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,399
now then we can say okay

223
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,760
is center of variable is center

224
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,360
available

225
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,640
available

226
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,480
if yes then go play the center

227
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,760
complete the center

228
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,240
if not

229
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,920
if not then

230
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,000
okay then we place the inner center

231
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:17,440
placement and then the end okay at the

232
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,839
end if not then we can say okay is

233
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,240
corner available right if yes then we

234
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,640
place in the corner and otherwise

235
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,760
continue so this this this is kind of

236
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,680
like the

237
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,519
the graph the

238
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,200
the graph for you to implement the

239
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,519
strategy right so we just check each

240
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,920
condition and if yes we do this

241
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,839
corresponding action right we talk about

242
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:41,200
the actions yeah this is one kind of

243
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:43,839
thing okay so now uh

244
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,880
this is okay if the search state is

245
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,480
small it's a search noise uh searches

246
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,440
stay small and not

247
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,440
complicated but if uh you know the chess

248
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,640
ball yeah it's a chess ball they're

249
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,839
different

250
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,680
pieces

251
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,760
you know the chest

252
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,160
you know the chance

253
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,040
chest is eight times a right

254
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,880
yeah

255
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,279
there another few pieces yeah pieces

256
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,279
many pieces so the number of state is

257
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:11,519
bigger a lot bigger than the tic-tac-toe

258
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,360
for the title we only have two

259
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,920
two pieces but for the chest we harmony

260
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,200
check how many pieces we have a king

261
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,160
we have a queen

262
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,320
we have a you know chromes exactly

263
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,240
i don't know that maybe eight yeah look

264
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,680
and then it's only eight times eight

265
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,920
okay so i don't know if this layer a a

266
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,560
if there are eight pieces then each one

267
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,959
has eight states there on including an

268
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,959
occupied with nine let's say nine so

269
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,560
nine times what

270
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,560
nine times

271
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:44,000
nine to the power of

272
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:46,800
64. so that's a very big that's a very

273
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,760
big number which we can't prove us right

274
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:52,160
because this example is so big like even

275
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:55,200
using the latest computer we can't just

276
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:57,680
just exhaust it search everything every

277
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,440
possible situation right all right

278
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,680
yeah so we certainly need a more

279
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,079
intelligent algorithm okay so how can we

280
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,880
how can we represent these uh

281
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:09,839
this uh state in the search so i show

282
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,760
you we will talk about the scan tree

283
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,720
what does that mean

284
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:18,640
the game tree okay

285
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:20,160
a country okay so at the beginning

286
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,320
at the beginning

287
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:26,839
at the beginning we are here so we are

288
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:30,720
have empty ball yeah and people yeah

289
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:33,920
now okay so now

290
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,760
now the first layer is cross so for

291
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,680
cross there how many possibilities are

292
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,320
there come on

293
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:43,839
look this is a starting point nine okay

294
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,120
so i could place i could place

295
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,640
here

296
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,640
look i could place

297
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,440
here right i could place

298
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,920
here etcetera okay

299
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,880
okay and once this game

300
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:03,120
crosses peaking here so what's the next

301
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:06,000
another cross so where can i put the

302
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:08,240
cross i'll put a circle

303
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,600
these are available right so if i put it

304
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:15,360
here then the game will become

305
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:18,160
what yeah yeah i could play place here

306
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,160
so you become

307
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,800
you will become a yeah accessory yeah

308
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:26,320
you see what i mean yeah

309
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,360
yeah okay so so these will go wrong so

310
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,920
this one

311
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,480
on the first layer the cross

312
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,720
the second the next layer

313
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,120
yeah the next next turn

314
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,880
and the next turn cross etc so each

315
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,680
player takes them okay

316
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,480
yeah

317
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,000
yeah

318
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,519
expand text

319
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,320
okay so now how do we evaluate the state

320
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:51,680
right how do we view it so at some point

321
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,120
here look if we go here go here i need

322
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,120
some

323
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,040
if after

324
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,160
the death is nine

325
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:02,399
look because they only almost nine yeah

326
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,639
nice lot here look

327
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:08,079
if if it's somewhere here or can you

328
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,920
tell me what should i give it to

329
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:12,800
who is winning

330
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,800
who is winning here

331
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:21,040
who is winning

332
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:24,079
x x x okay x is agent

333
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:26,320
and then this is

334
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:29,360
opponent

335
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:32,320
okay we talk about when x is winning

336
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,760
the utility function will give us

337
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,240
infinity

338
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,480
when this is winning

339
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,800
we give it negative infinity when this

340
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,800
is a draw so let's say we draw another

341
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,959
one which is the draw

342
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,120
which is somewhere something like that

343
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:49,920
okay i'm just

344
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,680
okay so for example

345
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:55,120
this is a draw right

346
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:57,519
so we give it a a score yellow okay

347
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,279
yeah so that so these are called

348
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,040
terminal states

349
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,560
because it's the leaf you know this is

350
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,399
like a tree yeah

351
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:07,360
we call it chemical yeah

352
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:09,040
what's three remember

353
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,040
yeah like entry

354
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,880
we talk about binary tree but here this

355
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,360
is not binary anymore because they look

356
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:18,560
how many states for each kid i mean how

357
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,240
many the maximum number of kids is nine

358
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,800
right for the first layer we have nine

359
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,920
kids nine possibilities so this is like

360
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,800
uh

361
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:29,680
the three with at most nine kids

362
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,440
but this the turbulent note

363
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,000
is that

364
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,639
is what it could be that nine

365
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,560
slots occupy or there's a some

366
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:41,440
somebody's winning utility function and

367
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:44,160
and state yeah so look we give a score

368
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,160
to each terminal leaves but so look if

369
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:49,360
if like say

370
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,160
x is winning uh at agent is the maximize

371
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,959
so

372
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,360
here

373
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,560
very come on this is very important we

374
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,560
top we

375
00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:00,320
the x

376
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:02,800
x here x is looking for

377
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:07,040
to maximize the values here so let's say

378
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:10,880
x is maximized try to maximize maximize

379
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:14,720
and the opponent here is try to minimize

380
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:18,240
okay so look this now here

381
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,199
x is x uh x is playing a field right so

382
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,120
you will

383
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,600
i i as a

384
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,639
agent i would that the agent would like

385
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,399
to maximize get the maximize maximum

386
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:32,000
value of this we know

387
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:35,040
but here at this point then the opponent

388
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,880
yeah opponent is playing opponent is

389
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:41,839
is minimizing the values here so look i

390
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:44,160
i play one i make a move um i need to

391
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,440
choose the maximum value i can get from

392
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,120
this this

393
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,680
yeah this state

394
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,720
and then now i choose one one move and

395
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,199
then you

396
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,880
opponent yeah needs to play again and

397
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:58,079
you have a few

398
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,920
choice a few solutions a few moves next

399
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,759
and you want to pick the minimum

400
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,839
right so

401
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:06,160
don't get it

402
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,839
two player one is trying to maximize the

403
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,000
other one you try to minimize right

404
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:12,160
because we're saying when agent is

405
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,720
winning we give a

406
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:17,440
infinity score when opponent is winning

407
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,839
we give a negative score when it's a

408
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,160
draw we give a zero okay so let's

409
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,880
perfectly fit into this country right so

410
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,480
at each layer one is maximizing the

411
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,759
other one is minimizing okay and then

412
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:32,000
now we can we we can

413
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:35,040
let's say we we can do this okay and

414
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,120
then you need to tell me the score i

415
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,600
draw a tree and then you tell me

416
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:42,480
tell me what uh what's the score okay i

417
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,959
only give the terminal value

418
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,480
determine the value tell me the least

419
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:48,320
value okay let's say

420
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,199
i have a node

421
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:53,120
okay

422
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:53,120
yeah let's just simplify a little bit

423
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:03,759
okay another one

424
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:06,000
and this is this is kind of like binary

425
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,000
yeah

426
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,400
okay

427
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:16,839
okay let's say

428
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,439
two three five

429
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:21,520
six seven

430
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,919
one

431
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:27,199
zero

432
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:29,919
minus five minus two three

433
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,520
one minus five minus three

434
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,960
okay so now

435
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,600
here

436
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:38,400
i want to get the maximum here

437
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:41,200
and i want to get a minimum here

438
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,799
okay what's the minimum of two and three

439
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,400
two two

440
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:48,400
what's the mean five and six five okay

441
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,960
what's that now i'm here i want to get

442
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,600
the maximum of two and five five

443
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,640
okay you get it seven one minimum

444
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,600
one

445
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:00,480
zero and five minimum minus five

446
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,559
minus two three minus two one minus

447
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,200
three minus three and now

448
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:06,320
one and minus five meaning maximum

449
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,600
one

450
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:11,440
minus two minus three maximum

451
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,720
minus two okay and then now i want to

452
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,880
get the

453
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,760
what was next so this is to get the

454
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:20,000
maximum okay uh

455
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,000
so this this is to get the maximum of

456
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,679
this now and here that will be getting

457
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,200
the minimum okay so i need probably need

458
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,559
to draw one more layer so i want to get

459
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,720
the minimum here

460
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,160
which is minus two okay

461
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,280
yeah

462
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,960
yeah so in this this way the country who

463
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,039
wins

464
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,520
minus wins is

465
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:43,039
let's say let's uh this is zero let's

466
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:45,039
draw okay and then agent is this way

467
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:47,120
and an opponent is this way and then

468
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:50,080
it's minus two so it means that this

469
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,960
game is more preferable to to opponent

470
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,240
okay

471
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,320
yeah

472
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:57,280
make sense right this is like getting

473
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,559
cheap okay so we call it this trick we

474
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,400
call it

475
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:05,039
min max three

476
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:07,600
mean max country right because look

477
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:09,520
yeah one player takes the maximum value

478
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,360
the other player takes the minimum menu

479
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,320
and the maximum value minimum value

480
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,799
maximum value minimum right it's like a

481
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,840
the two player they they are they they

482
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,640
are

483
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,799
their

484
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,200
target is

485
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:25,120
stands against each other their

486
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,160
purpose is different you want to go to

487
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,400
the south

488
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,160
another one want to go to the north

489
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,240
yeah that's the way it is the agent

490
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,679
wants to go to the right the opponents

491
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,960
go to the left

492
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,640
the agent wants to go to the right

493
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,440
that's why he needs to look for the

494
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:41,919
maximum value of the of the notes

495
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:44,000
yeah and then

496
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,160
the minima wants to go to the right left

497
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,120
here so he will try to minimize the

498
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,520
value

499
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,720
minimize the weight okay so look yeah

500
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,280
make sense

501
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,880
okay now that we can we can implement

502
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,760
this using the can

503
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,080
uh

504
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:01,480
uh mean max algorithm okay let's

505
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,480
implement this

506
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,120
define

507
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,960
mean

508
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,200
max

509
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,799
the first of all we have a okay sale

510
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,200
function and then

511
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:20,840
stay we have a state

512
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,840
can i please

513
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,919
so we have a depth okay so the number of

514
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,559
the the depth of the tree look entry and

515
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,240
now we have which turn is it

516
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,240
yeah which turn is it

517
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,840
if it's trying to maximize or try to

518
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,840
minimize

519
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,039
okay now look

520
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:42,559
if

521
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:44,559
if cell stop is n okay we have a we also

522
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,600
have to pass the state okay can state

523
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:49,360
okay

524
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:52,320
if the c of r is n is n is terminal okay

525
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,760
somebody ended here

526
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,600
then we need to

527
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:58,400
return the evaluation this is the

528
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,000
terminal uh note now we need to give it

529
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:04,000
a score so we return the utility

530
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:06,880
function yeah remember your cdt function

531
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,840
it is functional state okay

532
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:12,400
that means that look we are getting yeah

533
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:15,919
this is the three countries and then

534
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:18,480
as here this is ended it's ending this

535
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:21,360
is the end state and state

536
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,960
now we need to evaluate it right we need

537
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,200
to evaluate remember we talked about

538
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,960
utility function this is only applies to

539
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,960
the end and states

540
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,280
okay and then now

541
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,440
we can do this then we can say if turn

542
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,400
yeah if 10 let's say

543
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,760
if

544
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:39,280
this is the

545
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:41,120
maximize it yeah if this is the agent we

546
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,840
are trying to maximize it

547
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:46,480
yeah maximize it

548
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:49,840
then we have a score here score we want

549
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:52,320
to maximize it so let's give it a uh

550
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:55,840
minus infinity okay minus infinity

551
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:57,280
measure infinity now we need to try for

552
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,400
action

553
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:02,640
action in save the action remember save

554
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,960
the actions

555
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,720
from the current state

556
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,919
so we are now doing the action and we

557
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:12,720
need to give a new state here new state

558
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:15,039
equals self.success okay i set the

559
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,600
success with the

560
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:19,760
central success with the current state

561
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,400
yeah and then look this success function

562
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:24,720
we talked about you given a stay and we

563
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,200
given an action and it will give me a

564
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,520
new state okay and remember this

565
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,440
function will return a copy of the state

566
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,679
okay so it doesn't modify this state it

567
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,159
will return instead it will return a new

568
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:38,240
state now we have a new state

569
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:41,200
then i i want to get a score right so i

570
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:44,559
will score new score

571
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:47,120
new score equal very good look yeah

572
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:49,600
look cells don't mean max okay now this

573
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:52,640
is the question according to

574
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:55,280
the tree we talk about trees one way to

575
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,440
traverse the tree is to do the recursion

576
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,440
mean

577
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:02,640
and then that's plus one right so we

578
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:04,799
have to go going down one more level and

579
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,840
a ten would be minus ten right because

580
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:10,720
now

581
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:13,120
look if 10 try to maximize so minus 10

582
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:16,240
will be try to minimize yeah

583
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,679
and understand will be new state

584
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,919
all right

585
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:22,640
look there's a p 4 here if you're trying

586
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:25,280
to modify the original state and here we

587
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:27,520
need to revert the changes but now we

588
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:30,159
are copying we retain a new copy of the

589
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:32,960
state and here will be new new score and

590
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:36,480
then a new state new score is a new

591
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:38,240
score bigger than the score right we

592
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,000
find a bigger score then we try to

593
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,200
replace it score

594
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,840
equals

595
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,520
new score

596
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,520
right and then

597
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,440
after return we can just return the

598
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,120
score okay

599
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,880
return let's go

600
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,960
okay as

601
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:58,159
this is quite similar look

602
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:00,880
if 10 this is maximized alright and here

603
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:03,360
what are we trying to do here this this

604
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,039
block of code is trying to maximize and

605
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:08,240
what's what's here

606
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:10,000
what's here what should i put here

607
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,679
the obviously try to minimize what i'm

608
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,039
we are trying to minimize here so it

609
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,360
will be the same

610
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:17,279
similar score instead of at the

611
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,600
beginning minus infinity we are giving

612
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:21,679
the maximum infinity

613
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:24,480
maximum and then look this is the same

614
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:25,360
for act in certain actions then this is

615
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,240
the same

616
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,559
but

617
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,080
here if new score needs to change we

618
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,000
need to change the sign it's smaller

619
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,360
than score and score equal neutral and

620
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,679
we tend to go okay

621
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,360
mean max function we can actually

622
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:40,480
separate this mean max into two

623
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:42,640
functions mean five min and five max so

624
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,159
look if tan

625
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,400
mean max now which

626
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:48,400
if this is maximized so this will be

627
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,320
minimized so instead of the same

628
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,400
function we just minimalize here right

629
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:55,440
and then in the minimize we change this

630
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:58,240
here call this function maximize

631
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,240
make sense yeah

632
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,840
so now i'm writing everything inside

633
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,320
this function this function mean max

634
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:07,120
depending on the parameter 10

635
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,880
right when the turn is agent

636
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,480
you try to maximize

637
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:14,000
when the turn

638
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:16,640
is opponent you try to minimize

639
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,720
we can get rid of this parameter and

640
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:22,720
instead

641
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:24,799
instead we can we can do what we can

642
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,480
we can call in the max function we call

643
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,480
the mean in the mean function we cannot

644
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,159
mix okay and now we look at this

645
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,080
function return the score we can add one

646
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:34,320
more thing to return which is the action

647
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,159
so which action takes you you need to

648
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,279
play which move which which store you

649
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,679
need to play

650
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:42,000
you need to place together explore so we

651
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:43,440
instead of writing retaining a single

652
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,240
function right written in a single

653
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:48,720
function we can return

654
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,400
we can return the action as well as a

655
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,440
tuple right

656
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,960
okay

657
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,120
yeah

658
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,360
so if we implement this

659
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,440
the computer

660
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:02,159
knows how to

661
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:05,120
exhausted all the possible moves and

662
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:07,039
then try to get a best move

663
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:09,679
that's why

664
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:12,559
this is the game the computer is perfect

665
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:14,400
and we can't beat it

666
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:16,240
right as i said because this game is so

667
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,919
small like like

668
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,520
when you play at the beginning yeah you

669
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,320
play using the left hand with the right

670
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,679
hand

671
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,400
the best outcome we can get is a draw

672
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:26,000
right

673
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,640
if you play this game

674
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,679
again against computer

675
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:34,400
the best result is a draw

676
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:36,960
yeah no matter who plays first yeah yeah

677
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:39,200
because it's so small right as i said 3

678
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,360
to the power of nine right this is so

679
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:44,000
small i can just exhausted using this mi

680
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:46,240
max look this is min max yeah so like a

681
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,559
middle would do what he's gonna stay

682
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,480
right and then he can just exhausted

683
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:52,960
search of possible moves

684
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:55,200
possible moves yeah

685
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,520
action is like a move possible move and

686
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,050
it finds the best move right

687
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,320
yeah

688
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:02,720
[Music]

689
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,960
because the num the maximum that's the

690
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,960
maximum that is nine right the maximum

691
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,880
death is nine okay

692
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,200
okay so one more one last thing is what

693
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,480
if this is the chess game right

694
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,960
yeah

695
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,840
this chest the search space is so big

696
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,760
right

697
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,480
so so

698
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,840
how do you play a chess

699
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,279
how do you play how do we play your

700
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,520
chess how do we play we play a tic

701
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,880
tackle do we need to think about our

702
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,559
opponent's move

703
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,799
yeah as i said

704
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:34,320
we think about it yeah if if we think

705
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:36,720
okay the components move is next and

706
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:39,279
your checkmate or your fighter can see

707
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,960
you know three three uh

708
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:42,240
cross in a row

709
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,760
then we need to

710
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,679
block it right

711
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,919
that's uh that's the thinking the chance

712
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,919
is the same i play one i make one more

713
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:52,080
you make one move i make another one you

714
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:54,559
make another one so that's the thinking

715
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:57,279
right so but but for the chess state

716
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:58,720
that the you know the the search ball is

717
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,520
so big

718
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,760
so

719
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,840
there's a if you keep thinking if you're

720
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:06,720
thinking the search base another tree

721
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,960
exponential growth exponential you can

722
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,200
always finish all the searches right you

723
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,840
can't finish it because it's so big so

724
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:17,279
in excess we can set the max limit to

725
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:18,960
the search so we call it that

726
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:21,039
that's

727
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,480
d p t h that's

728
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:24,399
limit search

729
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,440
we talked about that mentioned that

730
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:27,760
before right

731
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:32,240
that's limited what does it mean okay so

732
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:33,279
let's say let's stop when the country

733
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,960
is

734
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:36,480
is what is that

735
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,360
like i say

736
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,200
death six okay so what does it mean so i

737
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:43,200
make one move you make one move i make

738
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,559
another one you make another one i make

739
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,240
another one you make another one and

740
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,919
that's it stop

741
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,640
that's the agreement we're not we'll

742
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:53,039
look no further because this let's uh

743
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,279
it's too far in the future right so i

744
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:57,600
stopped i i set a high limit to stop at

745
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:59,360
death's limit at six then we will

746
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,440
shorten the time to search right do you

747
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,600
understand because look this tree maybe

748
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,840
grow so big you'll be spending time

749
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,760
somewhere like if i said how they mean

750
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,200
like okay i'm stopping here and i don't

751
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:13,039
care what happened in the future let's

752
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,960
call destiny search right yeah yeah

753
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:16,559
any questions so far today

754
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,880

it's a what

761
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,840
it's a game tree so one layer is trying

762
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,360
to maximize it the other one is trying

763
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,760
to minimize it yeah

764
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:40,480
