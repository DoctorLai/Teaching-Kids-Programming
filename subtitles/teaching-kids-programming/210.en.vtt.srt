00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,310

today we'll talk about binary the weight

4
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:10,320
today we'll talk about binary the weight
 

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,589
today we'll talk about binary the weight
the weight maximum weight maximum risk

6
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:13,599
the weight maximum weight maximum risk
 

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,430
the weight maximum weight maximum risk
okay so by number three you already know

8
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:15,440
okay so by number three you already know
 

9
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,109
okay so by number three you already know
by mystery yeah the notes

10
00:00:17,109 --> 00:00:17,119
by mystery yeah the notes
 

11
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,750
by mystery yeah the notes
final three is one of the graphs yes

12
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:19,760
final three is one of the graphs yes
 

13
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,429
final three is one of the graphs yes
graph

14
00:00:21,429 --> 00:00:21,439
graph
 

15
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,390
graph
like how many notes can how many

16
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:24,400
like how many notes can how many
 

17
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,470
like how many notes can how many
children can the note have

18
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:26,480
children can the note have
 

19
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,509
children can the note have
two maximum yeah maximum yeah what

20
00:00:29,509 --> 00:00:29,519
two maximum yeah maximum yeah what
 

21
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,389
two maximum yeah maximum yeah what
exactly what are you about to say okay

22
00:00:32,389 --> 00:00:32,399
exactly what are you about to say okay
 

23
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,030
exactly what are you about to say okay
so the

24
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:33,040
so the
 

25
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,350
so the
let's define it look at that okay let's

26
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:35,360
let's define it look at that okay let's
 

27
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,150
let's define it look at that okay let's
do it

28
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:36,160
do it
 

29
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,430
do it
so it is nothing let's define the width

30
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:39,440
so it is nothing let's define the width
 

31
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,549
so it is nothing let's define the width
the next the width is the lever

32
00:00:42,549 --> 00:00:42,559
the next the width is the lever
 

33
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,830
the next the width is the lever
for level is the distance between

34
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:45,840
for level is the distance between
 

35
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,389
for level is the distance between
the left left mouse note and the right

36
00:00:48,389 --> 00:00:48,399
the left left mouse note and the right
 

37
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,670
the left left mouse note and the right
most note

38
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:49,680
most note
 

39
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,270
most note
okay and we're going to find the maximum

40
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:51,280
okay and we're going to find the maximum
 

41
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,350
okay and we're going to find the maximum
width which is the maximum

42
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:53,360
width which is the maximum
 

43
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,910
width which is the maximum
width of all levels yeah so for example

44
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:55,920
width of all levels yeah so for example
 

45
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,830
width of all levels yeah so for example
how many

46
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:57,840
how many
 

47
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,950
how many
how many the distance between one

48
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:00,960
how many the distance between one
 

49
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,510
how many the distance between one
leftmost no one and one is zero right

50
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:03,520
leftmost no one and one is zero right
 

51
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,149
leftmost no one and one is zero right
because

52
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:04,159
because
 

53
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,670
because
it's just one note right for the first

54
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:05,680
it's just one note right for the first
 

55
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,830
it's just one note right for the first
level yeah all right

56
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:07,840
level yeah all right
 

57
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,469
level yeah all right
that is the level two the number one

58
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:10,479
that is the level two the number one
 

59
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:15,109
that is the level two the number one
what's the distance

60
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:15,119

 

61
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,590

uh two two right because

62
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:19,600
uh two two right because
 

63
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,149
uh two two right because
there are two yeah two yeah and how many

64
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:22,159
there are two yeah two yeah and how many
 

65
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,510
there are two yeah two yeah and how many
notes can you

66
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:23,520
notes can you
 

67
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,990
notes can you
the distance between the notes in level

68
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:26,000
the distance between the notes in level
 

69
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,710
the distance between the notes in level
three

70
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:28,720

 

71
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,550

so you can put the one now here and the

72
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:30,560
so you can put the one now here and the
 

73
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,270
so you can put the one now here and the
most for yeah one two three four yeah

74
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:33,280
most for yeah one two three four yeah
 

75
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,590
most for yeah one two three four yeah
okay and

76
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:37,600
okay and
 

77
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,710
okay and
okay so if i have another note here so

78
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:40,720
okay so if i have another note here so
 

79
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,230
okay so if i have another note here so
what's the difference between this and

80
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:42,240
what's the difference between this and
 

81
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,230
what's the difference between this and
this

82
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:44,240
this
 

83
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,210
this
interesting yeah

84
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:46,220

91
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,230

three that's right yeah

92
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:56,240
three that's right yeah
 

93
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,429
three that's right yeah
so it's like that yeah you see

94
00:01:59,429 --> 00:01:59,439
so it's like that yeah you see
 

95
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,550
so it's like that yeah you see
here another two yeah okay

96
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:02,560
here another two yeah okay
 

97
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,749
here another two yeah okay
so one one two three four

98
00:02:05,749 --> 00:02:05,759
so one one two three four
 

99
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,190
so one one two three four
five six seven

100
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:09,200

 

101
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,510

yeah so you can squeeze all the nose

102
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:11,520
yeah so you can squeeze all the nose
 

103
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,229
yeah so you can squeeze all the nose
there

104
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:12,239
there
 

105
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,309
there
but then i know we want to calculate the

106
00:02:14,309 --> 00:02:14,319
but then i know we want to calculate the
 

107
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,350
but then i know we want to calculate the
distance

108
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:15,360
distance
 

109
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,710
distance
needs to be including the the leftmost

110
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:18,720
needs to be including the the leftmost
 

111
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,110
needs to be including the the leftmost
note and the rightmost note okay

112
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:21,120
note and the rightmost note okay
 

113
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,910
note and the rightmost note okay
so given these how do we calculate it i

114
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:23,920
so given these how do we calculate it i
 

115
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,390
so given these how do we calculate it i
mean

116
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:24,400
mean
 

117
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,750
mean
what's that how many ways of invisible

118
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:27,760
what's that how many ways of invisible
 

119
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,510
what's that how many ways of invisible
knives yeah yeah how many ways

120
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:29,520

121
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,630
knives yeah yeah how many ways
are we going to uh can we do to

122
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:32,640
are we going to uh can we do to
 

123
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:48,070

so let's uh how can we use the breakfast
 

173
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,589
so let's uh how can we use the breakfast
search to

174
00:03:53,589 --> 00:03:53,599
search to
 

175
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,750
search to
calculate the distance uh okay

176
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:57,760
calculate the distance uh okay
 

177
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,070
calculate the distance uh okay
so how can we do this we in order to

178
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,080
so how can we do this we in order to
 

179
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,190
so how can we do this we in order to
find the distance we

180
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:01,200
find the distance we
 

181
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,589
find the distance we
one way of doing this is that we need to

182
00:04:03,589 --> 00:04:03,599
one way of doing this is that we need to
 

183
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,429
one way of doing this is that we need to
have a way to calculate that

184
00:04:05,429 --> 00:04:05,439
have a way to calculate that
 

185
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,589
have a way to calculate that
coordinate yeah let's say that

186
00:04:07,589 --> 00:04:07,599
coordinate yeah let's say that
 

187
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,190
coordinate yeah let's say that
coordinate

188
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:09,200
coordinate
 

189
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,030
coordinate
of the left most and the right mode

190
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:11,040
of the left most and the right mode
 

191
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,949
of the left most and the right mode
right all right

192
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:12,959
right all right
 

193
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,429
right all right
and we can find out that the right most

194
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:15,439
and we can find out that the right most
 

195
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,310
and we can find out that the right most
for a note

196
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:16,320
for a note
 

197
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,229
for a note
if this is this is parent

198
00:04:20,229 --> 00:04:20,239
if this is this is parent
 

199
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:22,790
if this is this is parent
that the closing difference between its

200
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:22,800
that the closing difference between its
 

201
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,830
that the closing difference between its
left and right

202
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:23,840
left and right
 

203
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,950
left and right
is what is what

204
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:28,960
is what is what
 

205
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,749
is what is what
how many notes are i mean right next to

206
00:04:31,749 --> 00:04:31,759
how many notes are i mean right next to
 

207
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:32,710
how many notes are i mean right next to
it right

208
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:32,720
it right
 

209
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,749
it right
yeah okay so if we define the way of

210
00:04:35,749 --> 00:04:35,759
yeah okay so if we define the way of
 

211
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:36,790
yeah okay so if we define the way of
these

212
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:36,800
these
 

213
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,749
these
then we know that the right note is plus

214
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:39,759
then we know that the right note is plus
 

215
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,030
then we know that the right note is plus
one of the left note right yeah

216
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:43,040
one of the left note right yeah
 

217
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,350
one of the left note right yeah
so one way of doing this is if we go to

218
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:45,360
so one way of doing this is if we go to
 

219
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,469
so one way of doing this is if we go to
the

220
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:46,479
the
 

221
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,150
the
left what do we do

222
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:50,160

 

223
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,390

we can multiply by two yeah if this is

224
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:52,400
we can multiply by two yeah if this is
 

225
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,749
we can multiply by two yeah if this is
zero

226
00:04:53,749 --> 00:04:53,759
zero
 

227
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,070
zero
we can times zero here right it's still

228
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:56,080
we can times zero here right it's still
 

229
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,670
we can times zero here right it's still
zero right here is one

230
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:57,680
zero right here is one
 

231
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:05,430
zero right here is one
and you times two here is two all right

232
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:05,440

 

233
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,230

does it make sense okay let's take an

234
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:08,240
does it make sense okay let's take an
 

235
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,310
does it make sense okay let's take an
example like uh let's say

236
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:10,320
example like uh let's say
 

237
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,510
example like uh let's say
easy one okay let's say if we want to

238
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:13,520
easy one okay let's say if we want to
 

239
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,469
easy one okay let's say if we want to
if you want to calculate the distance

240
00:05:16,469 --> 00:05:16,479
if you want to calculate the distance
 

241
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,310
if you want to calculate the distance
between five and four

242
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:18,320
between five and four
 

243
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,990
between five and four
okay if we want to find the difference

244
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:20,000
okay if we want to find the difference
 

245
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,430
okay if we want to find the difference
between five and four

246
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:21,440
between five and four
 

247
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,390
between five and four
right and i alright yeah look this is

248
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:24,400
right and i alright yeah look this is
 

249
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,749
right and i alright yeah look this is
zero

250
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:25,759
zero
 

251
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,629
zero
this is what this times two

252
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:30,639
this is what this times two
 

253
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,029
this is what this times two
times t zero zero zero and here is zero

254
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:35,039
times t zero zero zero and here is zero
 

255
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,150
times t zero zero zero and here is zero
right times too much of at one this is

256
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:38,160
right times too much of at one this is
 

257
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,550
right times too much of at one this is
what

258
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:40,560

 

259
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,430

one okay if i turn if what's the value

260
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:43,440
one okay if i turn if what's the value
 

261
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,950
one okay if i turn if what's the value
of this

262
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:44,960
of this
 

263
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,590
of this
i mean if i times two this is times two

264
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:47,600
i mean if i times two this is times two
 

265
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,189
i mean if i times two this is times two
if i have no here that would be two

266
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:49,199
if i have no here that would be two
 

267
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:49,830
if i have no here that would be two
right

268
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:49,840
right
 

269
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,790
right
times two here will be two right and

270
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:52,800
times two here will be two right and
 

271
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,590
times two here will be two right and
then here

272
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:53,600
then here
 

273
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,710
then here
what was that times 2 plus 1

274
00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:58,720
what was that times 2 plus 1
 

275
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,909
what was that times 2 plus 1
3 3 okay so i know this is 3

276
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:01,919
3 3 okay so i know this is 3
 

277
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,029
3 3 okay so i know this is 3
and this is 0 so the distance is what 3

278
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:05,039
and this is 0 so the distance is what 3
 

279
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,710
and this is 0 so the distance is what 3
minus zero plus one

280
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:06,720
minus zero plus one
 

281
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,110
minus zero plus one
so like can we verify it yeah

282
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:11,120
so like can we verify it yeah
 

283
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,870
so like can we verify it yeah
okay yeah so look you can have four

284
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:14,880
okay yeah so look you can have four
 

285
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,590
okay yeah so look you can have four
right

286
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:15,600
right
 

287
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,749
right
so this initial value doesn't matter can

288
00:06:17,749 --> 00:06:17,759
so this initial value doesn't matter can
 

289
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,070
so this initial value doesn't matter can
we do use the one here

290
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,080
we do use the one here
 

291
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,590
we do use the one here
one here okay let's do this one

292
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:23,600
one here okay let's do this one
 

293
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,189
one here okay let's do this one
times two is two right two times two

294
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:27,199
times two is two right two times two
 

295
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,870
times two is two right two times two
is four right two times four

296
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:30,880
is four right two times four
 

297
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,830
is four right two times four
four plus one right five right one times

298
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:33,840
four plus one right five right one times
 

299
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,230
four plus one right five right one times
two

300
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:34,240
two
 

301
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,670
two
plus one is for three yeah

302
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:37,680
plus one is for three yeah
 

303
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,590
plus one is for three yeah
yeah three times two six

304
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:41,600
yeah three times two six
 

305
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,710
yeah three times two six
and that's seven so seven

306
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:44,720
and that's seven so seven
 

307
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,670
and that's seven so seven
minus four plus one equals one

308
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:49,680
minus four plus one equals one
 

309
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,510
minus four plus one equals one
okay so it's it's okay yeah the initial

310
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:51,520
okay so it's it's okay yeah the initial
 

311
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,870
okay so it's it's okay yeah the initial
value so look yeah if

312
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:52,880
value so look yeah if
 

313
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,710
value so look yeah if
it goes to the left you multiply by two

314
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:54,720
it goes to the left you multiply by two
 

315
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,070
it goes to the left you multiply by two
if it goes to the right

316
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:56,080
if it goes to the right
 

317
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,309
if it goes to the right
you multiply by two plus one right does

318
00:06:58,309 --> 00:06:58,319
you multiply by two plus one right does
 

319
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,430
you multiply by two plus one right does
it make sense

320
00:06:59,430 --> 00:06:59,440
it make sense
 

321
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,629
it make sense
okay so in this case in this case

322
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:02,639
okay so in this case in this case
 

323
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,909
okay so in this case in this case
we we can do this uh buffer search

324
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:05,919
we we can do this uh buffer search
 

325
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,150
we we can do this uh buffer search
and then exploring the nodes of the same

326
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:08,160
and then exploring the nodes of the same
 

327
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,189
and then exploring the nodes of the same
level

328
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:09,199
level
 

329
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,870
level
at once yeah and each one

330
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:12,880
at once yeah and each one
 

331
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,469
at once yeah and each one
at each level we can we can know the

332
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:16,479
at each level we can we can know the
 

333
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,550
at each level we can we can know the
distance between the leftmost node and

334
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:18,560
distance between the leftmost node and
 

335
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,110
distance between the leftmost node and
the rightmost and when we expanding the

336
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:21,120
the rightmost and when we expanding the
 

337
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,309
the rightmost and when we expanding the
uh children into the next level we if

338
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:24,319
uh children into the next level we if
 

339
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,469
uh children into the next level we if
it's the left node we multiply by two if

340
00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:26,479
it's the left node we multiply by two if
 

341
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,790
it's the left node we multiply by two if
it's a right node we multiply by two

342
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:28,800
it's a right node we multiply by two
 

343
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,230
it's a right node we multiply by two
and one and one

344
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:32,240
and one and one
 

345
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,990
and one and one
plus one and plus one yeah that's it

346
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:34,000
plus one and plus one yeah that's it
 

347
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,830
plus one and plus one yeah that's it
okay let's do this

348
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:35,840
okay let's do this
 

349
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:41,670
okay let's do this
let's do this coding

350
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:41,680

 

351
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,110

define max with

352
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:45,120
define max with
 

353
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:54,629
define max with
me good okay

354
00:07:54,629 --> 00:07:54,639

 

355
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,909

if it's an empty tree what's the answer

356
00:07:57,909 --> 00:07:57,919
if it's an empty tree what's the answer
 

357
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,510
if it's an empty tree what's the answer
of the

358
00:07:59,510 --> 00:07:59,520
of the
 

359
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,670
of the
what's the answer yeah

360
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:03,680
what's the answer yeah
 

361
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,710
what's the answer yeah
okay and then q equals

362
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:06,720
okay and then q equals
 

363
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,270
okay and then q equals
dq and at the beginning we need to put a

364
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:11,280
dq and at the beginning we need to put a
 

365
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:11,749
dq and at the beginning we need to put a
root

366
00:08:11,749 --> 00:08:11,759
root
 

367
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,070
root
in and then the initial value let's put

368
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:14,080
in and then the initial value let's put
 

369
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,270
in and then the initial value let's put
a one okay or zero

370
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:15,280
a one okay or zero
 

371
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,990
a one okay or zero
okay let's put it one okay i could be

372
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:18,000
okay let's put it one okay i could be
 

373
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,710
okay let's put it one okay i could be
better

374
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:18,720
better
 

375
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,950
better
okay okay all right

376
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:22,960
okay okay all right
 

377
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,469
okay okay all right
[Music]

378
00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:24,479
[Music]
 

379
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,830
[Music]
so can you tell me how do we implement

380
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:27,840
so can you tell me how do we implement
 

381
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,070
so can you tell me how do we implement
how to implement the breakfast search we

382
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,080
how to implement the breakfast search we
 

383
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,029
how to implement the breakfast search we
need to check

384
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:31,039
need to check
 

385
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:35,190
need to check
when there are notes when

386
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:35,200
when there are notes when
 

387
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,949
when there are notes when
how do we check how do we implement the

388
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:36,959
how do we check how do we implement the
 

389
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:38,790
how do we check how do we implement the
breakfast search we are the beginning of

390
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:38,800
breakfast search we are the beginning of
 

391
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,670
breakfast search we are the beginning of
the room

392
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:41,680
the room
 

393
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,230
the room
yeah so at what condition we how how do

394
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:44,240
yeah so at what condition we how how do
 

395
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,590
yeah so at what condition we how how do
we do this

396
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:45,600
we do this
 

397
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,110
we do this
how how do we usually implement a

398
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:47,120
how how do we usually implement a
 

399
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,790
how how do we usually implement a
perfect search here

400
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:48,800
perfect search here
 

401
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,790
perfect search here
yeah i know so we put the root in and

402
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:50,800
yeah i know so we put the root in and
 

403
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,070
yeah i know so we put the root in and
then

404
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:52,080
then
 

405
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,509
then
and then what's next then

406
00:08:55,509 --> 00:08:55,519
and then what's next then
 

407
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,590
and then what's next then
we take a luna out and we'll put the

408
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:57,600
we take a luna out and we'll put the
 

409
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,509
we take a luna out and we'll put the
kids in right

410
00:08:59,509 --> 00:08:59,519
kids in right
 

411
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,750
kids in right
okay so here what should we like here

412
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:03,760

 

413
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,110

what we do

414
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:07,120
what we do
 

415
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,470
what we do
at the beginning when are we asked uh

416
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:10,480
at the beginning when are we asked uh
 

417
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,070
at the beginning when are we asked uh
when are we terminating the brexit

418
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:12,080
when are we terminating the brexit
 

419
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,829
when are we terminating the brexit
search when do we

420
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:13,839
search when do we
 

421
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,710
search when do we
stop doing the process search when do we

422
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:16,720
stop doing the process search when do we
 

423
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,470
stop doing the process search when do we
stop doing the process search

424
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:18,480
stop doing the process search
 

425
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,670
stop doing the process search
okay why kill what does the wire kill me

426
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:21,680
okay why kill what does the wire kill me
 

427
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,949
okay why kill what does the wire kill me
well the key keeps on while q

428
00:09:24,949 --> 00:09:24,959
well the key keeps on while q
 

429
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,949
well the key keeps on while q
is is what it's not what why there's no

430
00:09:28,949 --> 00:09:28,959
is is what it's not what why there's no
 

431
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,030
is is what it's not what why there's no
in the queue what q is not empty right

432
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:31,040
in the queue what q is not empty right
 

433
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,870
in the queue what q is not empty right
yeah okay and then how many

434
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:32,880
yeah okay and then how many
 

435
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,269
yeah okay and then how many
y cube is not empty so count the note

436
00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:35,279
y cube is not empty so count the note
 

437
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,790
y cube is not empty so count the note
common notes in the queue

438
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:36,800
common notes in the queue
 

439
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,910
common notes in the queue
uh belongs to the same level yeah yeah

440
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:39,920
uh belongs to the same level yeah yeah
 

441
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,750
uh belongs to the same level yeah yeah
so how many notes are there in the cube

442
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:41,760
so how many notes are there in the cube
 

443
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,350
so how many notes are there in the cube
at the moment

444
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:43,360
at the moment
 

445
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,070
at the moment
one yeah i know but how can we do this s

446
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:46,080
one yeah i know but how can we do this s
 

447
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,389
one yeah i know but how can we do this s
z

448
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:46,399
z
 

449
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,150
z
equals one what so for is

450
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:50,160
equals one what so for is
 

451
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,829
equals one what so for is
or any variable equals one what cube

452
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:53,839
or any variable equals one what cube
 

453
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,389
or any variable equals one what cube
a function length of key yeah the length

454
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:56,399
a function length of key yeah the length
 

455
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:56,949
a function length of key yeah the length
of q

456
00:09:56,949 --> 00:09:56,959
of q
 

457
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,190
of q
and then here at the beginning we need

458
00:09:59,190 --> 00:09:59,200
and then here at the beginning we need
 

459
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,550
and then here at the beginning we need
to say that make

460
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:00,560
to say that make
 

461
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,750
to say that make
the lesson right let's say l and r at

462
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:03,760
the lesson right let's say l and r at
 

463
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,110
the lesson right let's say l and r at
the beginning the left

464
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:05,120
the beginning the left
 

465
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,870
the beginning the left
is the negative infinity right

466
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:08,880
is the negative infinity right
 

467
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,910
is the negative infinity right
negative infinity and number

468
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:11,920
negative infinity and number
 

469
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,069
negative infinity and number
i is one r is one

470
00:10:16,069 --> 00:10:16,079
i is one r is one
 

471
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,509
i is one r is one
the primer is what the bible is what

472
00:10:19,509 --> 00:10:19,519
the primer is what the bible is what
 

473
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,630
the primer is what the bible is what
uh even here

474
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:22,640
uh even here
 

475
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,389
uh even here
i minus math okay so

476
00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:26,399
i minus math okay so
 

477
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,230
i minus math okay so
so we have the left boundary right

478
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:28,240
so we have the left boundary right
 

479
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,750
so we have the left boundary right
boundary set to infinity at the

480
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:29,760
boundary set to infinity at the
 

481
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,310
boundary set to infinity at the
beginning

482
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:30,320
beginning
 

483
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,350
beginning
and then what should we do four we need

484
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:33,360
and then what should we do four we need
 

485
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,550
and then what should we do four we need
to

486
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:34,560
to
 

487
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,269
to
because they're currently okay okay

488
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:37,279
because they're currently okay okay
 

489
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,870
because they're currently okay okay
let's do this that's pretty

490
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:38,880
let's do this that's pretty
 

491
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,590
let's do this that's pretty
end okay they are currently n nodes in

492
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:41,600
end okay they are currently n nodes in
 

493
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,430
end okay they are currently n nodes in
the current level yeah for

494
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:43,440
the current level yeah for
 

495
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,430
the current level yeah for
underscore in range let's repeat anytime

496
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:47,440
underscore in range let's repeat anytime
 

497
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,710
underscore in range let's repeat anytime
right right

498
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:50,720
right right
 

499
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,190
right right
okay and then let's call it current

500
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:53,200
okay and then let's call it current
 

501
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,790
okay and then let's call it current
let's call it c

502
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:54,800
let's call it c
 

503

value yeah value
equal as one let's pop it c and v c

508
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:01,279
equal as one let's pop it c and v c
 

509
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,150
equal as one let's pop it c and v c
is the root v is the value so what

510
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:04,160
is the root v is the value so what
 

511
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,790
is the root v is the value so what
should i do q dot one

okay then pop left is taking notes from

534
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:35,920
okay then pop left is taking notes from
 

535
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,350
okay then pop left is taking notes from
the left side and you'll

536
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:37,360
the left side and you'll
 

537
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,790
the left side and you'll
take it from the right side yeah

538
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:40,800
take it from the right side yeah
 

539
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,630
take it from the right side yeah
that's what i mean yeah okay so we take

540
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:42,640

equals one the left hand side is what

550
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:56,560
equals one the left hand side is what
 

551
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,069
equals one the left hand side is what
mean of l and v right and can you tell

552
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:00,079
mean of l and v right and can you tell
 

553
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:00,710
mean of l and v right and can you tell
me

is c
 

579
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,030
is c
okay and then here is c c to the right

580
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:53,040
okay and then here is c c to the right
 

581
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,629
okay and then here is c c to the right
okay so c to the left and then what

582
00:12:56,629 --> 00:12:56,639
okay so c to the left and then what
 

583
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,829
okay so c to the left and then what
see the left what's this value kyoda

584
00:12:59,829 --> 00:12:59,839
see the left what's this value kyoda
 

585
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,710
see the left what's this value kyoda
appen

586
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:02,720

 

587
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,150

see the right and what

588
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:06,160
see the right and what
 

589
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,150
see the right and what
come on the value if we go to the left

590
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:08,160
come on the value if we go to the left
 

591
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,150
come on the value if we go to the left
what happened what happened to the value

592
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:10,160
what happened what happened to the value
 

593
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:10,870
what happened what happened to the value
v

594
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:10,880
v
 

595
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,509
v
times t v times two and if you go to the

596
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:13,519
times t v times two and if you go to the
 

597
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:14,310
times t v times two and if you go to the
right what happens

598
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:14,320
right what happens
 

599
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,350
right what happens
is three plus one times two plus one

600
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:17,360
is three plus one times two plus one
 

601
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,750
is three plus one times two plus one
okay and after this we have updated the

602
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:19,760
okay and after this we have updated the
 

603
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,870
okay and after this we have updated the
f and right

604
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:20,880
f and right
 

605
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,710
f and right
and the answer let's call it our answer

606
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:22,720
and the answer let's call it our answer
 

607
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,710
and the answer let's call it our answer
answer here equals zero okay

608
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:24,720
answer here equals zero okay
 

609
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,389
answer here equals zero okay
so answer equals next

610
00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:28,399
so answer equals next
 

611
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,629
so answer equals next
answer and what what

and then return what come on
yeah we we we now

616
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:41,760

 

617
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,310

okay so at this level we know the l and

618
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:44,320
okay so at this level we know the l and
 

619
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,269
okay so at this level we know the l and
r

620
00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:45,279
r
 

621
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,990
r
the left and right so what's the width

622
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:48,000
the left and right so what's the width
 

623
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,629
the left and right so what's the width
of that

624
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:48,639
of that
 

625
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,790
of that
level with which this level so here are

00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:50,800
level with which this level so here are
 

627
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,150
level with which this level so here are
a node and here is

628
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:52,160
a node and here is
 

629
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,269
a node and here is
air here's r uh what's the level what's

630
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:55,279
air here's r uh what's the level what's
 

631
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,150
air here's r uh what's the level what's
the distance

632
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:56,160
the distance
 

633
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,030
the distance
all right mine plus one you need to

634
00:13:59,030 --> 00:13:59,040
all right mine plus one you need to
 

635
00:13:59,040 --> 00:13:59,990
all right mine plus one you need to
transfer that

636
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:00,000
transfer that
 

637
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,189
transfer that
yeah okay because look if two and three

638
00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:03,199
yeah okay because look if two and three
 

639
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,350
yeah okay because look if two and three
what's the distance is three plus minus

640
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:05,360
what's the distance is three plus minus
 

641
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,310
what's the distance is three plus minus
two plus one is

642
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:06,320
two plus one is
 

643
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,310
two plus one is
two right it's not one right got it

644

two right it's not one right got it
 

645
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,590
two right it's not one right got it
i'm right yeah okay so r minus

646
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:13,600
i'm right yeah okay so r minus
 

647
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,670
i'm right yeah okay so r minus
r minus a plus one and then we want to

648
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:17,680
r minus a plus one and then we want to
 

649
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,430
r minus a plus one and then we want to
we want to keep record the maximum

650
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:21,440
we want to keep record the maximum
 

651
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,310

00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:31,279
at the beginning is the infinity and now
 

659
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,949
at the beginning is the infinity and now
we're expanding the endnote of the

660
00:14:32,949 --> 00:14:32,959
we're expanding the endnote of the
 

661
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,230
we're expanding the endnote of the
current level right

current level right
 

663
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,790
current level right
by expanding the nodes we up we use this

664
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:36,800
by expanding the nodes we up we use this
 

665
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,670
by expanding the nodes we up we use this
v

666

v
 

667
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,790
v
right we use the v to update the l and

668
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:40,800
right we use the v to update the l and
 

669
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,790
right we use the v to update the l and
right right all right yes all right

670
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:44,800
right right all right yes all right
 

671
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,710
right right all right yes all right
mean equal

672
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:48,720

 

673
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,750

yes actually

674
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:51,760
yes actually
 

675
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,790
yes actually
this is opposite right this is opposite

676
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:54,800
this is opposite right this is opposite
 

677
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,269
this is opposite right this is opposite
right because the left left you want to

678
00:14:57,269 --> 00:14:57,279
right because the left left you want to
 

679
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,150
right because the left left you want to
be the maximum

680
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:58,160
be the maximum
 

681
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,629
be the maximum
and right you want to be the minimum so

682
00:15:00,629 --> 00:15:00,639
and right you want to be the minimum so
 

683
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:01,750
and right you want to be the minimum so
air will be the

684
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:01,760
air will be the
 

685
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,110
air will be the
minimum of error right yeah i equals

686
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:05,120
minimum of error right yeah i equals
 

687
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,550
minimum of error right yeah i equals
maximum of e

688
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:06,560
maximum of e
 

689
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,230
maximum of e
right am right because ah the r boundary

690
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:10,240
right am right because ah the r boundary
 

691
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,750
right am right because ah the r boundary
right boundary at the beginning is

692
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:11,760
right boundary at the beginning is
 

693
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,310
right boundary at the beginning is
negative infinity so any number will be

694
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:14,320
negative infinity so any number will be
 

695
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,470
negative infinity so any number will be
bigger than negative infinity yeah so

696
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:16,480
bigger than negative infinity yeah so
 

697
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,470
bigger than negative infinity yeah so
these these two statements are

698
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:18,480
these these two statements are
 

699
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,790
these these two statements are
going to update the left and right

700
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:20,800
going to update the left and right
 

701
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,150
going to update the left and right
boundaries yeah

702
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:22,160
boundaries yeah
 

703
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,150
boundaries yeah
and then if they are the left nodes we

704
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:24,160
and then if they are the left nodes we
 

705
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,590
and then if they are the left nodes we
explain the node we insert the nodes

706
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:27,600
explain the node we insert the nodes
 

707
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,509
explain the node we insert the nodes
into the back of the key which is a pen

708
00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:29,519
into the back of the key which is a pen
 

709
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,350
into the back of the key which is a pen
right yeah

710
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:31,360
right yeah
 

711
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,389
right yeah
what's the what's the if i want to

712
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:34,399
what's the what's the if i want to
 

713
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,430
what's the what's the if i want to
you know this is dq a pen is append this

714
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:37,440
you know this is dq a pen is append this
 

715
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,430
you know this is dq a pen is append this
this direction at the back i want to put

716
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:39,440
this direction at the back i want to put
 

717
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,629
this direction at the back i want to put
it at the beginning

718
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:40,639
it at the beginning
 

719
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,670
it at the beginning
what's that apparent what depending the

720
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:43,680
what's that apparent what depending the
 

721
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,069
what's that apparent what depending the
left

722
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:44,079
left
 

723
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,550
left
yeah open left okay that's why it means

724
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:46,560
yeah open left okay that's why it means
 

725
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,430
yeah open left okay that's why it means
double ndq

726
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:47,440
double ndq
 

727
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,670
double ndq
and then we it's following the left

728
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:49,680
and then we it's following the left
 

729
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,350
and then we it's following the left
notes and right now

730
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:51,360
notes and right now
 

731
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,870
notes and right now
at the back of the back of the queue

732
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:54,880
at the back of the back of the queue
 

733
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,269
at the back of the back of the queue
and then we after these four we are

734
00:15:57,269 --> 00:15:57,279
and then we after these four we are
 

735
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:57,910
and then we after these four we are
finishing

736
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:57,920
finishing
 

737
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,150
finishing
expanding the nodes in the same level

738
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:00,160
expanding the nodes in the same level
 

739
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,749
expanding the nodes in the same level
and then now we know the r

740
00:16:01,749 --> 00:16:01,759
and then now we know the r
 

741
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,790
and then now we know the r
and l air are in there and we can

742
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:04,800
and l air are in there and we can
 

743
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,430
and l air are in there and we can
compute

744
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:05,440
compute
 

745
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,069
compute
the width of that level and then we keep

746
00:16:08,069 --> 00:16:08,079
the width of that level and then we keep
 

747
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:09,110
the width of that level and then we keep
answer is the

748
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:09,120
answer is the
 

749
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,790
answer is the
maximum level of maximum weight of

750
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:12,800
maximum level of maximum weight of
 

751
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,389
maximum level of maximum weight of
all levels this is the answer we're

752
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:14,399
all levels this is the answer we're
 

753
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,990
all levels this is the answer we're
looking for right what's the time

754
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:16,000
looking for right what's the time

759
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,269

yeah because we're using the kiwi okay

760
00:16:33,269 --> 00:16:33,279
yeah because we're using the kiwi okay
 

761
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,829
yeah because we're using the kiwi okay
yeah times convexity because we need to

762
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:35,839
yeah times convexity because we need to
 

763
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,790
yeah times convexity because we need to
visit

764
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:36,800
visit
 

765
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,150
visit
each node once right yeah all right if

766
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:40,160
each node once right yeah all right if
 

767
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,350
each node once right yeah all right if
we have n nodes in the

768
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:41,360
we have n nodes in the
 

769
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,590
we have n nodes in the
final tree we need to visit each node

770
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:43,600
final tree we need to visit each node
 

771
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,790
final tree we need to visit each node
once am right

772
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:44,800
once am right
 

773
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,870
once am right
yes does it make sense yeah

774
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:48,880
yes does it make sense yeah
 

775
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,520
yes does it make sense yeah
okay

776
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:51,530
okay
 

777
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:58,389

779
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,389

what's these two come on you see it

780
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:00,399
what's these two come on you see it
 

781
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,509
what's these two come on you see it
what's this i did not

782
00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:03,519
what's this i did not
 

783
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,990
what's this i did not
so we we are expanding like we are

784
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:06,000
so we we are expanding like we are
 

785
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,789
so we we are expanding like we are
popping that

786
00:17:06,789 --> 00:17:06,799
popping that
 

787
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,270
popping that
the key uh the element from q we need to

788
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:09,280
the key uh the element from q we need to
 

789
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:16,390
the key uh the element from q we need to
update l and r
