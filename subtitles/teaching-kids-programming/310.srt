1
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,820
what's the

2
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:23,339
binary

3
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:23,339
[Music]

4
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,640
okay so but

5
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,399
in order to be a binary search tree he

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,559
literally does it

7
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,600
so we haven't the left it needs to be

8
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,640
smaller

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,480
yeah

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,120
than the root

11
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,840
and the right needs to be bigger

12
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,840
and the reach

13
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,760
so this is the virus here violent the

14
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,800
left nose are strictly smaller than the

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,199
parents

16
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,039
yeah the right nose are strictly bigger

17
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,399
than their parents okay so there's no

18
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,399
duplicate numbers

19
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,120
okay so if i put look

20
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:06,880
i tell you okay if this number is six is

21
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:10,720
this still a final 33 yeah

22
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,439
yeah yeah it is no no it's not because 6

23
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,280
is

24
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,000
bigger than five it should be on the

25
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,000
right right tree you see now that's why

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,880
i say street is smaller so

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,400
yeah why is that because if it's uh oh

28
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,119
yeah yeah yeah

29
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,119
so what in what order eric can you sit

30
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,920
down but what order

31
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,880
you know in order to traverse the tree

32
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,479
it gives

33
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,920
pre-order yeah

34
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,960
is it free

35
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,360
in order so you know that was another

36
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,520
order left in order

37
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,320
where them left

38
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,040
right

39
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,520
so you visit the left first

40
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,280
okay so say that a famous quote again if

41
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,200
you visit the tree

42
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,600
in order

43
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,560
in order we know that you'll be in order

44
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,560
yeah yeah wow

45
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:04,159
get it okay

46
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,560
in order so you visit the left tree

47
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,720
first so that's two

48
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,920
and what's next four

49
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,160
two in order three three

50
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,160
four

51
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,680
five

52
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,800
seven eight nine nine

53
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,360
okay seven eight nine okay

54
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,760
okay so what's the third third

55
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,879
what's the third smallest number

56
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,440
the first volume uh four

57
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,760
four okay so today's task very easy

58
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,000
given about research tree and the k we

59
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,400
also try to find the k

60
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,440
k smallest number and you just using

61
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,000
okay we just ordered this and just just

62
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:47,040
find the third one what's yeah okay one

63
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,640
way would be we we first of all perform

64
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,879
the in order

65
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,640
yeah and then we get we get the numbers

66
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,080
and we put in an array and then we can

67
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,920
just you know

68
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,200
retrieve the case

69
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:03,720
the case one right yeah

70
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,720
make sense yeah let's buy this

71
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,879
and then think about a time and space

72
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,720
complexity which i'm going to ask you

73
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,720
okay don't guess a one or one okay

74
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,800
okay smallest

75
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,040
another root

76
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,360
so usually we can put this in the data

77
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,920
we put in the data and then we could do

78
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,519
this data search define

79
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,400
yeah define

80
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,159
that was the truth okay first of all we

81
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,720
first want to check what this is very

82
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,640
simple yeah very template if not load we

83
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,519
just return right if not rule just

84
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,000
return

85
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,680
and then whatever nothing i know what we

86
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,480
do we first of all

87
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,519
we

88
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,879
already

89
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,640
first of all the pre-order what's

90
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,440
pre-order we visit the left tree first

91
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,519
right

92
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,640
[Music]

93
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:57,280
sorry dfs

94
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:01,239
left yeah and then we visit the note

95
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,239
which you put it in the data

96
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,949
[Music]

97
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,639
okay so that is visiting the right

98
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:21,759
okay so this this uh yeah yeah this data

99
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:24,639
is is defined here so we have to

100
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,759
put a long local keyword just to make uh

101
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,720
just to

102
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,960
uh tell it that it's not defined locally

103
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,040
it's it's it's it's outside this

104
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,680
function non-local data

105
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,080
and once we do this data search

106
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,840
root then we can we have this we have

107
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,560
populated the data right then we can

108
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,960
return

109
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,280
theta

110
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,360
k minus one yeah because its style is

111
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,440
one at first if you give a one then the

112
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,199
index will be zero

113
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,120
okay so this is one way of doing this

114
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,520
application the

115
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,040
inorder okay so we don't actually need

116
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,800
to this yeah we don't actually need we

117
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,120
can make it a bit

118
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:07,600
pretty you know to make it it's the same

119
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,600
but we make it a pretty so we do this

120
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:14,080
okay so we can just do this

121
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,639
if not is not root

122
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,759
if not root we just return return empty

123
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,080
this

124
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,160
and okay yeah this is look empty empty

125
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,440
this empty yeah otherwise we just

126
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,840
written one

127
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,440
return from search

128
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,840
rule left

129
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,240
read the right no no no plus we because

130
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,360
we want to press together plus

131
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:38,320
do the value yeah i kind of know yeah

132
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,000
and plus can you guess read or write dfs

133
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,400
do the right yeah

134
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,720
you see and then

135
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,039
we just do this one data

136
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,639
equals definite search

137
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,960
root

138
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,560
and then written data yeah look this is

139
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,880
prettier right because we don't declare

140
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,639
any variables outside this function and

141
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,720
it's it's quite clean look

142
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,840
this function will return a list of the

143
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,080
values

144
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,479
and you know we want to do this in order

145
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,960
so if it's if the root is empty we just

146
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:09,440
written empty this all right so we just

147
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,919
return we have we return the left left

148
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,639
tree yeah we don't know we recursively

149
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:17,360
call it and then we append the current

150
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,120
node or value right all right

151
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,800
yeah and then we do this root of right

152
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,639
right

153
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,360
uh and i want to do that what's the type

154
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:29,360
of space complexity anyone

155
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:32,880
anyone the time complexity is

156
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,880
if there are unknowns in the past

157
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,280
yeah wear them clothes

158
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,000
you know i feel i should give you this

159
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,680
uh

160
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,039
sticker there for answering the

161
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,759
questions yeah but we don't have

162
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:45,120
anything okay so i i asked mommy to buy

163
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,540
some okay

164
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,639
what's the space complexity

165
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,639
[Music]

166
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,840
so

167
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:03,759
do we actually need to visit

168
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:06,160
orlando ordinary right look because we

169
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:09,039
are interested in the case

170
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:12,000
right if we travel if we iterated the

171
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,520
traveler tree in order and after we

172
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,479
reach the cave

173
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:19,599
do we have to care about the rest

174
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,520
no right we don't have right all right

175
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,280
so what does this mean look let's write

176
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,800
this again

177
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,919
7

178
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,199
5

179
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,479
6

180
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,560
4

181
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,840
okay so let's say 9

182
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,560
10

183
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,880
11 12 you know keep going yeah keep

184
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,400
going to your a minion okay

185
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,240
okay that's what i mean this is really

186
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,039
extreme cases we want to find out

187
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,560
that'll take forever no no in this one

188
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,319
you'll close on because there are notes

189
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,080
in the chip but look

190
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,759
if i want you to fight tell me what's

191
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,639
the small what's the first smallest

192
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,879
number

193
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,199
four okay

194
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,280
we can go through here do we have to

195
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,800
visit all the others

196
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,479
that's right because we already know

197
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,120
it's here so why do we need to keep

198
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,639
visiting of all this

199
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,680
what was k

200
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,039
k is one if k is one the smallest yeah

201
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,520
case

202
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,280
k is two means the second smallest okay

203
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,560
so what's the second smallest in this

204
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,520
spanish

205
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,400
five is active you see so how do we do

206
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,879
this

207
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,960
iteratively we want to iterate with

208
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,160
during this in order

209
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,680
right

210
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:29,199
so first of all

211
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:33,039
we can have a sec we can what's the step

212
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,039
say stacking stack

213
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,320
first thing that's all yeah first thing

214
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:41,120
so look at yeah stack

215
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,360
stack yeah stack it goes in this way and

216
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,000
you take out this way yeah this is there

217
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,000
okay so look

218
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:53,120
we are here we're 7 27 here

219
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,640
we go left as long as we can okay look

220
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,640
look yeah five

221
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,120
four

222
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:03,040
yeah we can't go to the left right

223
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,600
yeah then we take one out

224
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,200
we take one out when we do we

225
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,160
we reduce this k

226
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,800
is k right if k equals zero then that's

227
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,240
the value we're looking for if not

228
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,860
if you know what

229
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,959
if not what

230
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:19,519
[Music]

231
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:22,880
if you know what

232
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,920
so we if we take this out if not then we

233
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,360
go

234
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,519
we we

235
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,519
we

236
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,279
take take one out and we we then we go

237
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,680
to it's right okay we go so it's right

238
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,760
look so we take a four if there's not

239
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,480
right there's no right right there's no

240
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,959
right or four so we don't do it we don't

241
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,399
we keep we keep taking another one which

242
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,760
is five

243
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,160
which is five

244
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,839
now we take a five out

245
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,800
we take a five out and we go to each

246
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:56,080
right right look because why

247
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,440
because look we go as far as and as left

248
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,360
as we can

249
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,360
and we in the reverse order

250
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,600
in the reverse order

251
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,839
you'll feel a value that's smallest

252
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,839
right

253
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,440
look

254
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,279
okay if there is no four here what's the

255
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,800
smallest number here

256
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,440
uh

257
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,680
[Music]

258
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,320
sorry look we go to the left as as long

259
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,399
as we can and we take it out this is the

260
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,680
smallest number right yeah if there's

261
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,120
four here

262
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,279
then that's the smallest if there are

263
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,120
three here that's the smallest right so

264
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:31,839
the smallest number is always on the

265
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,680
left right so we go to the left as deep

266
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,760
as as left as we want

267
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,160
we can right when we can't go to the

268
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,399
left we take one out

269
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,920
we can take one out yeah because we take

270
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,440
our line we need to decrement okay if

271
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,320
this is zero that's the number we're

272
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,640
looking for and then we go to each right

273
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,640
right look this is four five yeah we

274
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,040
take 5 out and we need to go to his

275
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,240
right why is that because the right is

276
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,720
bigger than the

277
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:00,000
camera number it's the next

278
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,760
biggest number which is bigger than the

279
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,440
next bigger number right less bigger

280
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,240
number than five right

281
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,079
yeah and after we we find that k equals

282
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,000
the value then we just return it and we

283
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,360
don't need to traverse all the

284
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,360
next right

285
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,440
right okay

286
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,120
makes sense

287
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,959
okay um let me write it down and then

288
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,320
you probably will understand more okay

289
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:24,800
so this is a bit tricky but

290
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,720
you know but but it's uh it has a better

291
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,000
performance than the first one the first

292
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,519
approach is very simple yes

293
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,839
straightforward

294
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,240
okay and you both know how to do it the

295
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,560
term complexity is aware right

296
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,560
no matter the no matter the k value is

297
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,560
we still have to traverse all the nodes

298
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,079
in the binary search tree right but for

299
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,839
this second approach we just need to

300
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,399
travel a k

301
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,640
element yeah if k is two one two three

302
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:51,200
small we don't need to travel the whole

303
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:53,519
binary search tree right

304
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,360
okay so first of all we have a step how

305
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,120
do we implement a stack

306
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,959
remember we use the what kind of data

307
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,959
structure we use to implement that

308
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:07,360
sorry

309
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,480
recursion okay no no no stay which one

310
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,480
tell me

311
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,480
which

312
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:24,160
[Music]

313
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:27,279
don't change it yeah yeah we don't

314
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,800
change it yeah we immutable this oh it's

315
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,720
we can call it function yeah caller

316
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,560
function

317
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,560
call function parameters okay so we use

318
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,880
the list

319
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:40,560
okay now why

320
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:44,720
why loot you know root or the stack is

321
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:46,480
not is is not empty then what the y

322
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,800
root then we

323
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,760
we keep visiting the left yeah so we put

324
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:54,240
in the stack we put the root

325
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,000
we put a loop on the left

326
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,639
yeah

327
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,399
and then loot equals to the left right

328
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:04,839
we keep visiting the left until we come

329
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:08,160
until we come so look

330
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:10,000
seven five

331
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,959
four

332
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,760
six

333
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,079
and

334
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,440
uh let's say six okay

335
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:18,079
yeah

336
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:21,279
so look we we push this into the stack

337
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:24,000
so we push the seven here push the five

338
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:26,480
as long as we can visit it and if not

339
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,240
if not what we take right now pick one

340
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,519
up instead

341
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,680
do

342
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,279
equal how do we take one hour from the

343
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,959
stack

344
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,720
how do we take one out from the stack

345
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,519
what's the message

346
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,040
pop pop yeah pop what does the problem

347
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,720
mean

348
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,959
take away

349
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:48,399
in english what does it mean

350
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:49,360
it means it's like a bubble exploding oh

351
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,000
yeah yeah

352
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,399
balloon yeah pop yeah popping okay

353
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,360
exploding

354
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,880
so technically this is popping uh yeah

355
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,839
this is seven

356
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,839
and there was five

357
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:06,119
[Music]

358
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,920
so look we take one element from the

359
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:19,519
stack which is the next smallest number

360
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:22,000
so what do we do with the k remember k

361
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,240
what k equals

362
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,720
k one okay we need to look we take one

363
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,120
out we need to take the k

364
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,720
kind of pop that k k is the number we

365
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,160
what do we do with the k we take one

366
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,240
number out

367
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,959
we already know that number which is a

368
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,440
pen

369
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:39,360
k is a number

370
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,079
remember so look

371
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,639
we already found the next smallest

372
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:46,639
number then we take it out so k is the

373
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,120
number we want to make it reduce to zero

374
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:52,079
so what do we do is okay k equals zero

375
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,079
right okay

376
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,639
minus equal

377
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,639
one one we take one all right and now we

378
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,000
need to check if k equals zero if k

379
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,800
equals zero what does mean that's the

380
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,600
number we want to find so we return to

381
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,600
the value yeah

382
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,360
okay so look we take one now five out

383
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,760
and then what should we do what's the

384
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,839
what's the biggest number then five

385
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:19,600
the smallest number biggest than five

386
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:21,920
six so where is it that where is it

387
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,920
right

388
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,120
i said

389
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,279
okay so what's the time complexity

390
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,000
so if it's that long what one is that

391
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,360
long

392
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,519
what's the terminology guess okay

393
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,360
[Music]

394
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,360
k is one of them because we have to

395
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,639
reduce it to k right yeah this is

396
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:59,440
certainly okay k is there right okay but

397
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,360
at the beginning k plus one

398
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,079
if it's one constant we don't put it you

399
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:07,680
know when we talk about complexity we

400
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:09,600
ignore the constant you know 100 200

401
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,480
yeah we don't we don't

402
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,810
do that because okay plus 100

403
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,920
is the same as okay okay

404
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:17,839
[Music]

405
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,680
make sense okay so look

406
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,800
what's this part let's look what's this

407
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:25,279
one we're traveling the left yeah

408
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,759
we we need to travel in the left as deep

409
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:29,440
as we can right so that is if this

410
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:32,079
spinal tree is balanced yeah it's

411
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,199
balanced right that is o

412
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:36,240
plus

413
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:37,199
k power h yeah h in the balance one

414
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,199
would be

415
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:41,519
log n right there and no in the worst

416
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,120
case it would be n what's in the worst

417
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,959
case can you guess

418
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,279
what's what's the word

419
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:49,680
yeah well done so it's in the worst case

420
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:51,440
it's like that yeah it's like that

421
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,839
yeah and then you want to find for

422
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,759
example a minion a minion

423
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,720
yeah a minion that's a 100 a minion

424
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:01,279
minus one a minimum infinity yeah and

425
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,519
then i want to find a mean a minus one

426
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:05,600
one you have to push this a million

427
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:08,480
times and then you have to go back at

428
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:11,120
least yeah go back so this is really a

429
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,439
worst case right but in a balanced case

430
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,160
in the best case easy actually it would

431
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,880
be

432
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,880
a full binary a balance of a four yeah

433
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,079
so every node would be

434
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,039
you know

435
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:26,319
a four yeah so that the nodes would be

436
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:27,199
the the the h height would be log n

437
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,760
right

438
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,679
okay n is the number of nodes okay

439
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,679
make sense we're done eric that's very

440
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:36,559
well done okay this is the extreme cases

441
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:39,760
because the remember the binary tree if

442
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:41,280
it integrated into a

443
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,000
linked list

444
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,679
then there's no point of using binary

445
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,760
because binary you know

446
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,600
why is it useful why is it useful

447
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,280
because sometimes you can go to the left

448
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,960
and then not care about the right or you

449
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:58,559
go to the right not care about that then

450
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,400
it gives you the performance boost by

451
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:02,640
by what by ignoring the other half

452
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:05,760
that's why we have log n right we have

453
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,600
log n half when you see a lot it's half

454
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,160
half half remember the binary search

455
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,160
binary search i have a number in my mind

456
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,559
you guess

457
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,360
between 0 to 100

458
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,679
and

459
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,440
uh you make a guess almost always

460
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,760
guessed in the meter right if

461
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,720
if you guess 50 and my number is 40 i

462
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:27,200
say it's smaller then

463
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,799
yeah you know it's between 0 to 50 not

464
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,360
between 50 to

465
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,240
100 right look you already abandoned

466
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,559
half

467
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:37,440
you see every time that that man

468
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:40,400
oh it's halfway so it takes time so it's

469
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:43,760
faster faster to look out if

470
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,280
if you okay so i have a number in my

471
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,360
mind

472
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,520
and if you're not having it you always

473
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,880
make a guess from zero one two three in

474
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,240
the worst case how many times you need

475
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,640
to i went

476
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,880
a hundred times right got it but with

477
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,440
the final research

478
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,880
i log in we're done okay

479
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,960
okay so

480
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:06,080
that's it for today good job yes good

481
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:11,000
job say bye to people

482
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:11,000
bye bye bye bye bye bye
