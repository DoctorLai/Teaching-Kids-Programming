00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:44,959
current note
 

345
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,949
current note
and the current note will become calling

346
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:46,959
and the current note will become calling
 

347
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,710
and the current note will become calling
the next note right

348
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:48,720
the next note right
 

349
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,350
the next note right
yeah yes so this is another way of doing

350
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:51,360
yeah yes so this is another way of doing
 

351
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,550
yeah yes so this is another way of doing
this

352
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:52,560
this
 

353
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,190
this
look we just have uh remove one okay so

354
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:55,200
look we just have uh remove one okay so
 

355
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,829
look we just have uh remove one okay so
we only remove one node okay

356
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:57,839
we only remove one node okay
 

357
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,509
we only remove one node okay
got it yes but this one

358
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:01,519
got it yes but this one
 

359
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,670
got it yes but this one
is it removing only one node no

360
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:05,680
is it removing only one node no
 

361
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,269
is it removing only one node no
if not this one is only removed

362
00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:09,279
if not this one is only removed
 

363
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,070
if not this one is only removed
in one note but this one may may be more

364
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:12,080
in one note but this one may may be more
 

365
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,949
in one note but this one may may be more
more than that

366
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:12,959
more than that
 

367
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,949
more than that
right because look if height is value

368
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:14,959
right because look if height is value
 

369
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,070
right because look if height is value
with

370
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:16,080
with
 

371
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,949
with
value is if there are duplicate numbers

372
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:18,959
value is if there are duplicate numbers
 

373
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,590
value is if there are duplicate numbers
then you will return head on next

374
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:21,600
then you will return head on next
 

375
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,870
then you will return head on next
right you had returned headphone next

376
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:24,880
right you had returned headphone next
 

377
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,509
right you had returned headphone next
head on next equals no head on next so

378
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:27,519
head on next equals no head on next so
 

379
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,110
head on next equals no head on next so
these two are not

380
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:29,120
these two are not
 

381
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,110
these two are not
exactly the same it's the same you will

382
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:31,120
exactly the same it's the same you will
 

383
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,470
exactly the same it's the same you will
remove if they

384
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:32,480
remove if they
 

385
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,070
remove if they
are duplicate numbers and then the

386
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:34,080
are duplicate numbers and then the
 

387
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,670
are duplicate numbers and then the
number you're looking for

388
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:35,680
number you're looking for
 

389
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,949
number you're looking for
is the number you want to remove right

390
00:09:38,949 --> 00:09:38,959
is the number you want to remove right
 

391
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:44,310
is the number you want to remove right
then

392
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:44,320

 

393
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:55,350

then what

394
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:55,360

 

395
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,230

yeah then if there are two two variants

396
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:58,240
yeah then if there are two two variants
 

397
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,389
yeah then if there are two two variants
it will move ahead of next

398
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:00,399
it will move ahead of next
 

399
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,150
it will move ahead of next
yeah yeah i think this will work this

400
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:02,160
yeah yeah i think this will work this
 

401
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,990
yeah yeah i think this will work this
will work yes my mistake

402
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:04,000
will work yes my mistake
 

403
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,110
will work yes my mistake
if you want to remove all everything if

404
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:07,120
if you want to remove all everything if
 

405
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,190
if you want to remove all everything if
you want to remove every

406
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:09,200
you want to remove every
 

407
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,190
you want to remove every
every number if there are multiple

408
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:11,200
every number if there are multiple
 

409
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,230
every number if there are multiple
numbers yes

410
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:12,240
numbers yes
 

411
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,150
numbers yes
if there are multiple tools you want to

412
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:14,160
if there are multiple tools you want to
 

413
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,350
if there are multiple tools you want to
remove

414
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:15,360
remove
 

415
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,590
remove
so if you have the magnetic you want to

416
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:17,600
so if you have the magnetic you want to
 

417
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,470
so if you have the magnetic you want to
all remove it

418
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:18,480
all remove it
 

419
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,910
all remove it
so add here remove before this

420
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:21,920
so add here remove before this
 

421
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,630
so add here remove before this
return to remove uh remove node head on

422
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:24,640
return to remove uh remove node head on
 

423
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,590
return to remove uh remove node head on
next

424
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:25,600
next
 

425
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,269
next
like in this case it will remove every

426
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:27,279
like in this case it will remove every
 

427
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,230
like in this case it will remove every
every node okay and this one

428
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:30,240
every node okay and this one
 

429
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,430
every node okay and this one
if if then if you want to remove

430
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:33,440
if if then if you want to remove
 

431
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,069
if if then if you want to remove
everything

432
00:10:34,069 --> 00:10:34,079
everything
 

433
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,350
everything
so i return i'm not looking ahead here

434
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:37,360
so i return i'm not looking ahead here
 

435
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,030
so i return i'm not looking ahead here
so if current value becomes very

436
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:39,040
so if current value becomes very
 

437
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,670
so if current value becomes very
previous previous not next equals

438
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:41,680
previous previous not next equals
 

439
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,870
previous previous not next equals
current or next

440
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:42,880
current or next
 

441
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,470
current or next
and what should we do previous equal

442
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:46,480
and what should we do previous equal
 

443
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,110
and what should we do previous equal
one and then look

444
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:51,120

 

445
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,509

okay so this is previous this is current

446
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:53,519
okay so this is previous this is current
 

447
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,389
okay so this is previous this is current
okay so now

448
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:54,399
okay so now
 

449
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:59,110
okay so now
i just link it okay so now

450
00:10:59,110 --> 00:10:59,120
i just link it okay so now
 

451
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,790
i just link it okay so now
now i need to move this previous equals

452
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:02,800
now i need to move this previous equals
 

453
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,230
now i need to move this previous equals
current

454
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:04,240
current
 

455
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,630
current
and then current equal then and then i i

456
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:06,640
and then current equal then and then i i
 

457
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,509
and then current equal then and then i i
need to put here

458
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:07,519
need to put here
 

459
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,509
need to put here
current equals current dot next

460
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:11,519
current equals current dot next
 

461
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,910
current equals current dot next
right so because this is this is the

462
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:13,920
right so because this is this is the
 

463
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,710
right so because this is this is the
note okay

464
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:14,720
note okay
 

465
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,790
note okay
this is the note i'm going to remove

466
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:16,800
this is the note i'm going to remove
 

467
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,230
this is the note i'm going to remove
yeah but when i remove

468
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:18,240
yeah but when i remove
 

469
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,470
yeah but when i remove
really i need to move the current into

470
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:20,480
really i need to move the current into
 

471
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,350
really i need to move the current into
the next note

472
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:21,360
the next note
 

473
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,990
the next note
right yeah into the next step and then

474
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:24,000
right yeah into the next step and then
 

475
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,870
right yeah into the next step and then
after this

476
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:24,880
after this
 

477
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,710
after this
the previous current and then we just

478
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:26,720
the previous current and then we just
 

479
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,350
the previous current and then we just
need to move shift one more time

480
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:29,360
need to move shift one more time
 

481
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,350
need to move shift one more time
right yes yes and how about this is the

482
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:33,360
right yes yes and how about this is the
 

483
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:33,990
right yes yes and how about this is the
same

484
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:34,000
same
 

485
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,030
same
look if this is the this is two this is

486
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:37,040
look if this is the this is two this is
 

487
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:37,829
look if this is the this is two this is
two

488
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:37,839
two
 

489
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,550
two
so that will become a problem right will

490
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:40,560
so that will become a problem right will
 

491
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,110
so that will become a problem right will
that be a problem

492
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:43,120
that be a problem
 

493
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,030
that be a problem
because you you're here and then you

494
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:45,040
because you you're here and then you
 

495
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,430
because you you're here and then you
move you move it to here

496
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:47,440
move you move it to here
 

497
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,990
move you move it to here
and then you move it to here but this is

498
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:50,000
and then you move it to here but this is
 

499
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,910
and then you move it to here but this is
not removed

500
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:51,920
not removed
 

501
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,110
not removed
okay this is not removed

502
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:55,120
okay this is not removed
 

503
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,750
okay this is not removed
so in this case we have to you'll be

504
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:57,760
so in this case we have to you'll be
 

505
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,350
so in this case we have to you'll be
tricky here to write

506
00:11:59,350 --> 00:11:59,360
tricky here to write
 

507
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,750
tricky here to write
right here so you will have to change

508
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:01,760
right here so you will have to change
 

509
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,990
right here so you will have to change
this if to white

510
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:04,000
this if to white
 

511
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,190
this if to white
why current y current now

512
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:07,200
why current y current now
 

513
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,870
why current y current now
equals the value

514
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:10,880
equals the value
 

515
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,910
equals the value
right and i need to do this previous the

516
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:13,920
right and i need to do this previous the
 

517
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,310
right and i need to do this previous the
next previous dot next equals current

518
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:16,320
next previous dot next equals current
 

519
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,190
next previous dot next equals current
the next current

520
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:17,200
the next current
 

521
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,550
the next current
equals current the next right

522
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:20,560
equals current the next right
 

523
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,030
equals current the next right
and after this i can relink it another

524
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:23,040
and after this i can relink it another
 

525
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,350
and after this i can relink it another
way of doing this is

526
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:25,360
way of doing this is
 

527
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:32,710
way of doing this is
is is what hey

528
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:32,720

 

529
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,550

okay so uh i think that's enough for

530
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:34,560
okay so uh i think that's enough for
 

531
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:50,389
okay so uh i think that's enough for
today uh let's do the coding too yeah

532
00:12:50,389 --> 00:12:50,399

 

533
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:51,480

can i

534
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:51,490

print message okay
so now we can do this now let's remove

600
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:21,040
so now we can do this now let's remove
 

601
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:21,350
so now we can do this now let's remove
it

602
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:21,360
it
 

603
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,550
it
so define remove the node

604
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:24,560
so define remove the node
 

605
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,990
so define remove the node
head value let's try the first one

606
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:28,000
head value let's try the first one
 

607
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,150
head value let's try the first one
recursive okay let's try the recursive

608
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:30,160
recursive okay let's try the recursive
 

609
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,870
recursive okay let's try the recursive
one so if head

610
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:32,880
one so if head
 

611
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,189
one so if head
is now return what

612
00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:37,199
is now return what
 

613
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,389
is now return what
none right if half the value

614
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:40,399
none right if half the value
 

615
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:46,790
none right if half the value
is the value we're looking for return

616
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:46,800

 

617
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,590

next right yes yes

618
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:51,600
next right yes yes
 

619
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,550
next right yes yes
otherwise what have done next uh

620
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:54,560
otherwise what have done next uh
 

621
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,110
otherwise what have done next uh
actually

622
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:55,120
actually
 

623
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:55,870
actually
this is the

624
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:55,880
this is the
 

625
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:11,030
this is the
[Music]

626
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:11,040

 

627
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,150

uh note value

628
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:14,160
uh note value
 

629
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,590
uh note value
right yeah and then let's let's try if

630
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:17,600
right yeah and then let's let's try if
 

631
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,470
right yeah and then let's let's try if
it is work

632
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:18,480
it is work
 

633
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,590
it is work
okay you remove our head

634
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:21,600
okay you remove our head
 

635
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,030
okay you remove our head
five okay and then we need to because

636
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:25,040
five okay and then we need to because
 

637
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,110
five okay and then we need to because
are not sure if the head is removed we

638
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:27,120
are not sure if the head is removed we
 

639
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,230
are not sure if the head is removed we
do this

640
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:28,240
do this
 

641
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,430
do this
head equals removal head okay

642
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:31,440
head equals removal head okay
 

643
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,790
head equals removal head okay
and then point pulling this

644
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:34,800
and then point pulling this
 

645
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,790
and then point pulling this
head after right

646
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:38,800
head after right
 

647
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,509
head after right
does it work i'm not sure okay

648
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:43,519

 

649
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,230

yes oh no it doesn't work it doesn't

look after it has nothing so what what's
the problem

656
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:54,399
the problem
 

657
00:15:54,399 --> 00:16:00,870
the problem
no head of value

658
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:00,880

 

659
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,389

why it doesn't work i don't know

661
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,629
why it doesn't work i don't know
it was hard if head of value

662
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:08,639
it was hard if head of value
 

663
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,910
it was hard if head of value
is the value we are looking for then we

664
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:11,920
is the value we are looking for then we
 

665
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:17,350
is the value we are looking for then we
return head to next note

666
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:17,360

 

667
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:23,829

anything right
 

685
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,670
anything right
you need to return head right you're not

686
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:51,680
you need to return head right you're not
 

687
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,269
you need to return head right you're not
returning anything so it doesn't put

688
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:53,279
returning anything so it doesn't put
 

689
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:58,150

699
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,230

okay so let's look how about if we have

700
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:16,240
okay so let's look how about if we have
 

701
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,870
okay so let's look how about if we have
multiple values let's see that does this

702
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:18,880
multiple values let's see that does this
 

703
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,669
multiple values let's see that does this

705
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,870

remove two files okay

706
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:22,880
remove two files okay
 

707
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:28,230
remove two files okay
yes so let's see let's add

708
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:28,240

 

709
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,270

let's

710
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:31,280

 

711
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,310

add another note which is five okay

712
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:34,320
add another note which is five okay
 

713
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,270
add another note which is five okay
does it does it remove all of it no it

714
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:37,280
does it does it remove all of it no it
 

715
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,029
does it does it remove all of it no it
doesn't remove it look before you will

716
00:17:39,029 --> 00:17:39,039
doesn't remove it look before you will
 

717
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:39,669
doesn't remove it look before you will
be fine

718
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:39,679
be fine
 

719
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,510
be fine
in the beginning five at the end it does

720
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:41,520
in the beginning five at the end it does
 

721
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,110
in the beginning five at the end it does
not move yeah

722
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:43,120
not move yeah
 

723
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,789
not move yeah
right the second second

724
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:46,799
right the second second
 

725
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,789
right the second second
node is not removed right so

726
00:17:50,789 --> 00:17:50,799
node is not removed right so
 

727
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,390
node is not removed right so
easy fix would be just do this

728
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:54,400
easy fix would be just do this
 

729
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,549
easy fix would be just do this
remove node head

730
00:17:58,549 --> 00:17:58,559
remove node head
 

731
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:06,540
remove node head
the next note right

732

because there we move now have the next

because there we move now have the next
 

739
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,630
because there we move now have the next

743
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,909

we need to specify what what you want to

744
00:18:21,909 --> 00:18:21,919
we need to specify what what you want to
 

745
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,630
we need to specify what what you want to

751
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,310
do you get it i get it
the the there are two

752
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:34,320
the the there are two
 

753
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,669
the the there are two
one five the other five right

754
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:37,679
one five the other five right
 

755
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,830
one five the other five right
i will be more one needs to move the

756
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:39,840
i will be more one needs to move the
 

757
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,710
i will be more one needs to move the
move this one

758
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:40,720
move this one
 

759
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:47,909
move this one
so it's gone it's gone

760
00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:47,919

 

761
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,390

yeah monster is right okay so this is

762
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:50,400
yeah monster is right okay so this is
 

763
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,789
yeah monster is right okay so this is
the recursive version so it's working

764
00:18:52,789 --> 00:18:52,799
the recursive version so it's working
 

765
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,510
the recursive version so it's working
how about

766
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:53,520
how about
 

767
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,669
how about
we do this non-recursive version which

768
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:55,679
we do this non-recursive version which
 

769
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,669
we do this non-recursive version which
is let's call it remote

770
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:57,679
is let's call it remote
 

771
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,870
is let's call it remote
number two okay version two okay if i

772
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:00,880
number two okay version two okay if i
 

773
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,270
number two okay version two okay if i
remove row two cut value

774
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:05,280
remove row two cut value
 

775
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:10,789
remove row two cut value
if have this is the same

776
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:10,799

 

777
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,390

yes so now

778
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:14,400
yes so now
 

779
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,510
yes so now
if head is numb return now if head

780
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:19,520

 

781
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,830

so let's say previous now equals

782
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:22,840
so let's say previous now equals
 

783
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:31,190
so let's say previous now equals
now

784
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:31,200

 

785
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,270

why carano

786
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:35,280

 

787
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,950

is known now so we also have to check if

788
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:38,960
is known now so we also have to check if
 

789
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,430
is known now so we also have to check if
the

790
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:43,440

 

791
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,909

if head of value is value

792
00:19:47,909 --> 00:19:47,919

 

793
00:19:47,919 --> 00:20:00,070

if header value is valid

794
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:00,080

 

795
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,149

the next next node

796
00:20:04,149 --> 00:20:04,159
the next next node
 

797
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:08,470
the next next node
value right so this is this is the way i

798
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:08,480
value right so this is this is the way i
 

799
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,350
value right so this is this is the way i
i could now i can make sure the first

800
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:11,360
i could now i can make sure the first
 

801
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,029
i could now i can make sure the first
first note is not a note we want to

802
00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:13,039
first note is not a note we want to
 

803
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,710
first note is not a note we want to
remove okay

804
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:14,720
remove okay
 

805
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,830
remove okay
current note because head or next no

806
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:17,840
current note because head or next no
 

807
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,390
current note because head or next no
why can't a note

808
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:22,400

 

809
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,430

we move return head right

810
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:25,440
we move return head right
 

811
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,789
we move return head right
one current note

812
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:28,799

 

813
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,909

so y current

814
00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:31,919
so y current
 

815
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,590
so y current
and current is not now right now

816
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:35,600
and current is not now right now
 

817
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,950
and current is not now right now
and current dot value is the very well

818
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:38,960
and current dot value is the very well
 

819
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,870
and current dot value is the very well
