so any idea how we're doing this this
 

99
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,470
so any idea how we're doing this this
how are we doing this

100
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:58,480

 

101
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,509

so first of all we need to

102
00:03:01,509 --> 00:03:01,519
so first of all we need to
 

103
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,550
so first of all we need to
suppose this let this uh

104
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:04,560
suppose this let this uh
 

105
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,470
suppose this let this uh
these sentences are separated by y

106
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:06,480
these sentences are separated by y
 

107
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,350
these sentences are separated by y
spaces so how can we split

108
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:09,360
spaces so how can we split
 

109
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,430
spaces so how can we split
the sentences into words i just say that

110
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:13,440
the sentences into words i just say that
 

111
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,509
the sentences into words i just say that
using that function

112
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:17,519

 

113
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,750

if you want to split the string by a

114
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:19,760
if you want to split the string by a
 

115
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,710
if you want to split the string by a
delimiter

116
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:20,720
delimiter
 

117
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,670
delimiter
which one should we use join no no no

118
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:23,680
which one should we use join no no no
 

119
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,270
which one should we use join no no no
the opposite of john john is

yeah split
okay george split okay so we can split

144
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:03,120
okay george split okay so we can split
 

145
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,670
okay george split okay so we can split
by spaces and then you become words and

146
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:05,680
by spaces and then you become words and
 

147
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,270
by spaces and then you become words and
for each word we

148
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:07,280
for each word we
 

149
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,309
for each word we
we just need to check each word if

150
00:04:10,309 --> 00:04:10,319
we just need to check each word if
 

151
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,869
we just need to check each word if
if all of the characters are in

152
00:04:14,869 --> 00:04:14,879
if all of the characters are in
 

153
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,830
if all of the characters are in
i are using these broken key letters and

154
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:17,840
i are using these broken key letters and
 

155
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,030
i are using these broken key letters and
all right if you're using broken

156
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:19,040
all right if you're using broken
 

157
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,590
all right if you're using broken
keywords

158
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:19,600
keywords
 

159
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,749
keywords
we don't need to increment the answer if

160
00:04:21,749 --> 00:04:21,759
we don't need to increment the answer if
 

161
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,830
we don't need to increment the answer if
we if all the letters are not in the

162
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:23,840
we if all the letters are not in the
 

163
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,270
we if all the letters are not in the
broken list

164
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:25,280
broken list
 

165
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,070
broken list
so how do we enable the one lookup for

166
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,080
so how do we enable the one lookup for
 

167
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:28,950
so how do we enable the one lookup for

00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:32,880
letters
 

173
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,710
letters
what kind of data structure are we using

174
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:34,720
what kind of data structure are we using
 

175
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,870
what kind of data structure are we using
you know if we want to enable checking

176
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:36,880
you know if we want to enable checking
 

177
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,310
you know if we want to enable checking
something is in something uh yes what

178
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:40,320
something is in something uh yes what
 

179
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,030
something is in something uh yes what
what does that

180
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,040
what does that
 

181
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,830
what does that
no it's actually not necessarily the

182
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:43,840
no it's actually not necessarily the
 

183
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,230
no it's actually not necessarily the
code we just need to check if something

184
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:46,240
code we just need to check if something
 

185
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,550
code we just need to check if something
is in if something is in a list

186
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:50,560
is in if something is in a list
 

187
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,990
is in if something is in a list
so what kind of data structure are we

188
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,000
so what kind of data structure are we
 

189
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,749
so what kind of data structure are we
using

190
00:04:53,749 --> 00:04:53,759
using
 

191
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,310
using
notebook has headset set yeah headset so

192
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:56,320
notebook has headset set yeah headset so
 

193
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,430
notebook has headset set yeah headset so
first of all

194
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:57,440
first of all
 

195
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,670
first of all
first of all we put the broken letters

196
00:04:59,670 --> 00:04:59,680
first of all we put the broken letters
 

197
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,510
first of all we put the broken letters
okay so let's do it define

198
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:01,520
okay so let's do it define
 

199
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,590
okay so let's do it define
this is broken

200
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:05,600

 

201
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,230

all right okay let's define

202
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:10,240
all right okay let's define
 

203
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,710
all right okay let's define
let's say let's just say f function okay

204
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:12,720
let's say let's just say f function okay
 

205
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,629
let's say let's just say f function okay
this is broken

206
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:14,639
this is broken
 

207
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,110
this is broken
okay so let's uh sentences and then

208
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:17,120
okay so let's uh sentences and then
 

209
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,430
okay so let's uh sentences and then
broken letters okay broken

210
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:19,440
broken letters okay broken
 

211
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,510
broken letters okay broken
broken letters okay let's see okay

212
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:23,520
broken letters okay let's see okay
 

213
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,550
broken letters okay let's see okay
so first of all we please in a broken

214
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:26,560
so first of all we please in a broken
 

215
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,110
so first of all we please in a broken
letter

216
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:27,120
letter
 

217
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,469
letter
into a headset so set yeah

218
00:05:30,469 --> 00:05:30,479
into a headset so set yeah
 

219
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,350
into a headset so set yeah
set we put it in a broken broken into

220
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:33,360
set we put it in a broken broken into
 

221
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,909
set we put it in a broken broken into
the headset so broken

222
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:35,919
the headset so broken
 

223
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,790
the headset so broken
okay then answer is the number of words

224
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:38,800
okay then answer is the number of words
 

225
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,790
okay then answer is the number of words
we can type equal zero

226
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:40,800
we can type equal zero
 

227
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,310
we can type equal zero
so first we need to split it yeah

228
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:44,320
so first we need to split it yeah
 

229
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,189
so first we need to split it yeah
so if we split it let's say array okay

230
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:47,199
so if we split it let's say array okay
 

231
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,350
so if we split it let's say array okay
let that work let's put it words here

232
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:49,360
let that work let's put it words here
 

233
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,150
let that work let's put it words here
yeah

234
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:50,160
yeah
 

235
00:05:50,160 --> 00:06:02,150
yeah
what equals

236
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:02,160

 

237
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,110

empty space yeah then these words would

238
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:05,120
empty space yeah then these words would
 

239
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,710
empty space yeah then these words would
be a list of strings they have these two

240
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:06,720
be a list of strings they have these two
 

241
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,749
be a list of strings they have these two
words okay

242
00:06:07,749 --> 00:06:07,759
words okay
 

243
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,830
words okay
yeah yeah and then we need to go through

244
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:09,840
yeah yeah and then we need to go through
 

245
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,309
yeah yeah and then we need to go through
this one therefore

246
00:06:12,309 --> 00:06:12,319
this one therefore
 

247
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,629
this one therefore
in in what for word in that broken

248
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:16,639
in in what for word in that broken
 

249
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,230
in in what for word in that broken
meanwhile in what we just please

250
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:20,240
meanwhile in what we just please
 

251
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,070
meanwhile in what we just please
we want to go through the list of words

252
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:24,080
we want to go through the list of words
 

253
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,029
we want to go through the list of words
for what w in one word yeah what

254
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:29,039
for what w in one word yeah what
 

255
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:33,029
for what w in one word yeah what
okay so now w is a string yeah like arry

256
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:33,039
okay so now w is a string yeah like arry
 

257
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,510
okay so now w is a string yeah like arry
then we we want to go through leads to

258
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:35,520
then we we want to go through leads to
 

259
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,070
then we we want to go through leads to
check

260
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:36,080
check
 

261
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,110
check
if each letter is in not in b right

262
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:39,120
if each letter is in not in b right
 

263
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,189
if each letter is in not in b right
so we can do this if or look this is the

264
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:43,199
so we can do this if or look this is the
 

265
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,469
so we can do this if or look this is the
keyword or or or means that everything

266
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:46,479
keyword or or or means that everything
 

267
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,629
keyword or or or means that everything
in here needs to satisfy the meter

268
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:48,639
in here needs to satisfy the meter
 

269
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:49,589
in here needs to satisfy the meter
criteria

270
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:49,599
criteria
 

271
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,830

i in what so what is the worst so
 

281
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,749
i in what so what is the worst so
look for each letter not in b so for i

282
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:25,759
look for each letter not in b so for i
 

283
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,110
look for each letter not in b so for i

what's this come on b is that
 

287
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,309
what's this come on b is that
set of program so for i not in b for i

289
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,670
set of program so for i not in b for i
i need to define what's i was

what's space complexity
what's space convexity oh and

what's space convexity oh and
 

317
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,510
what's space convexity oh and
why is that one because we're using my

318
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:21,520
why is that one because we're using my
 

319
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,950
why is that one because we're using my
name but

320

here's a noble actually it's o mu
m is the number of broken characters

324
00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:28,479
m is the number of broken characters
 

325
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:29,589
m is the number of broken characters
yeah o m

326
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:29,599
yeah o m
 

327
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,790
yeah o m
okay o m so look we

328
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:32,800
okay o m so look we
 

329
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,389
okay o m so look we
why is this oh and look at there is a

330
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:34,399
why is this oh and look at there is a
 

331
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,550
why is this oh and look at there is a
phone it's a thing why is it 01

332
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:36,560
phone it's a thing why is it 01
 

333
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,670
phone it's a thing why is it 01
because look we split the characters in

334
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:39,680
because look we split the characters in
 

335
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,709
because look we split the characters in
the string right

336
00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:40,719
the string right
 

337
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,790
the string right
in words and we go through each word

338
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:42,800
in words and we go through each word
 

339
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,389
in words and we go through each word
each character yeah

340
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:44,399
each character yeah
 

341
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,630
each character yeah
how many times n times we need to check

342
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:46,640
how many times n times we need to check
 

343
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,630
how many times n times we need to check
each character

344
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:48,640
each character
 

345
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,750
each character
to see if it's in the b right so let's

346
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:51,760
to see if it's in the b right so let's
 

347
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:51,990
to see if it's in the b right so let's
say

348
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:52,000
say
 

349
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,350
say
that if all i not in b

350
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:55,360
that if all i not in b
 

351
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,630
that if all i not in b
for i in w you can expand this into

352
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:58,640
for i in w you can expand this into
 

353
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,630
for i in w you can expand this into
multiple lines but this is the

354
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:00,640
multiple lines but this is the
 

355
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,990
multiple lines but this is the
um more easy way right it's a more

356
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,000
um more easy way right it's a more
 

357
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,509
um more easy way right it's a more
straightforward way okay

358
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:05,519
straightforward way okay
 

359
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,430
straightforward way okay
so if all what can you write it and

360
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:07,440
so if all what can you write it and
 

361
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,949
so if all what can you write it and
that's it

362
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:08,959
that's it
