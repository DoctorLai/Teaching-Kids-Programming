1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,199
oh

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,880
hello miss area all right

3
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:07,200
okay so we're given this graph right

4
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:10,000
this is the weighted graph right way to

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,840
graph graph is the collection of vertex

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,639
and edges right

7
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,120
yeah

8
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,039
a tree is also a graph right

9
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,080
tree is a graph it's directly a cyclic

10
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,400
graph right

11
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,080
directly you know from the parents the

12
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,359
kids exactly means it doesn't have

13
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,080
cycles but

14
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,160
this is a graph weighted graph okay

15
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,880
we can have a weighted graph with

16
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,160
direction okay so look we can have this

17
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,680
diagonal

18
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,320
yeah

19
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,640
oh we don't right it doesn't matter so

20
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,640
here

21
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:45,200
here if we if we if this is the weighted

22
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,039
directive graph right weighted

23
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,760
and we want to find the shortest path

24
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,760
from the s to e right the cumulative

25
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,079
cost right so which which one is the

26
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,000
shortest one can you can you see very

27
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,640
clear uh

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,640
s a

29
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,120
[Music]

30
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,280
look here one don't be don't fall for

31
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,680
that because this is a trip to the truck

32
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,360
right before it asks you to go lease but

33
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,479
look there's a hundred much bigger

34
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,799
weight here

35
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,799
but all humans are quite clever right we

36
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,840
can see this like you know instinct

37
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,280
reflect

38
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,880
reflect and okay so this is the normal

39
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,479
ideal way

40
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,680
so

41
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:27,920
with the different search okay

42
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,759
that's okay with the death massage it

43
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,560
doesn't work quite well in this case

44
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,320
because the deficit doesn't handle the

45
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,280
cases when the

46
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,439
edges have caused right yeah

47
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,159
and breakfast search

48
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:45,119
either right the breakfast search isn't

49
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,960
working quite well as well right so now

50
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,439
today we're going to talk about another

51
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,079
search which is called uniform construct

52
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,799
this is very good to handle the

53
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,079
the shortest path from the front to

54
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,360
vertex

55
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:02,079
we we have actually talked about another

56
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,880
aggregate from the fly you probably

57
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:07,360
can't

58
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,360
remember right it's a on cubic

59
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,599
yeah yeah look why is that look it's

60
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,360
actually it's actually based on the

61
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:18,080
dynamic programming look it's like that

62
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,200
okay the shortest distance between

63
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,319
i

64
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,879
to j

65
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:25,760
is equals to the mean

66
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:28,319
mean of what mean of shortest distance d

67
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:32,319
i j

68
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,319
and then d i k

69
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,519
and answer d

70
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,239
plus t

71
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,000
k j okay what does it mean actually it's

72
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,040
very easy look

73
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,879
here

74
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,840
i want to calculate a certain distance

75
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,680
between i to j right yeah

76
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,080
then i can do please i put it in the

77
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,959
loop oh and free times and now what

78
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,360
happened so if i find a path

79
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,720
look if i find the part somewhere this

80
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,840
is k

81
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,440
all right

82
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,200
if i find the path

83
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,319
i want to calculate the circuit system

84
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:08,000
between i to j but now i found a better

85
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:10,480
shorter path which is i k plus ikj

86
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,879
then i can replace i j with this pattern

87
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,200
right yeah well done this now this is

88
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,000
100 and this is one this is two

89
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,159
so

90
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
d i j is 100 now but i found d i k is on

91
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,640
dk j is 2

92
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,720
so i can replace the i k with 1 plus 2

93
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,599
equals 3. yeah let's let's that's about

94
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,840
it so we just search we just do this for

95
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,400
k in

96
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,360
range

97
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,760
and

98
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,120
for i in range

99
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,599
and for j in range n and then to this d

100
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,720
i j equals mean d i j

101
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,400
comma d i k plus p k j let's say oh this

102
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,799
is the simple

103
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,360
shortest path between any two points any

104
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,439
two vertex right but it takes time

105
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,120
it takes one cubit let's slow that's why

106
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,599
we're not talking about that today we're

107
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,360
talking about uniform close search so

108
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,439
the way to understand uniform cross

109
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,040
search is actually very simple you know

110
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,200
for the preferences to use the kill

111
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,439
right first thing first out right but

112
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,239
for the cost uniform cost search we

113
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:12,080
replace the q is the priority queue

114
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,599
okay that's the first thing priority

115
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,479
first thing

116
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:18,799
priority up right yeah so you have the

117
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:20,959
people you're waiting in the so priority

118
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,400
queue is like right okay so you you you

119
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,840
know first things first our first in

120
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,880
first off now

121
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,720
it it's not like that so you have a

122
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,680
let's say who is taller

123
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,040
first okay so i have a people here yeah

124
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,000
this is the people

125
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,960
play in the queue and then here

126
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,160
john a taller and then another another

127
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,440
guy john

128
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,680
much taller

129
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,360
okay so now the scale

130
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,240
yeah

131
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,880
if the higher priority is the taller the

132
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,400
taller the higher priority length when

133
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,639
we dq then this guy gets gets in front

134
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,560
of the q and this serve okay this is top

135
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,960
priority right

136
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,320
yeah okay so now um

137
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:07,039
so first of all

138
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:09,039
if if the if the course is one or one

139
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,639
can you imagine what happened

140
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,600
course it's all become all one will

141
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,639
happen

142
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,400
you'll be

143
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:18,639
like you'll be like what

144
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,960
what what did i just say we are trying

145
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,479
to replace the preferences

146
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,000
yeah exactly we're replacing the

147
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,400
preference search with the priority

148
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,840
queue right but if the course is all one

149
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,880
all the same

150
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,440
all the same or one okay then then it

151
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:36,160
actually becomes a perfect search right

152
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,280
so so how can we do this look if at the

153
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,240
beginning we

154
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:44,000
uh we put a

155
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:46,400
s in it so s in it okay so s the cost

156
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,800
from s to s is zero

157
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,720
now we take the priority of the high

158
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,759
priority which is the lower cost from

159
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,720
the kill

160
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,840
i put it i remove it i put it in s

161
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,120
okay

162
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:02,240
when we then when the removed vertex is

163
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,000
the destination that we we quit we stop

164
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,880
the algorithm because we already found

165
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,280
it okay now s is not e so we continue

166
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:12,560
so s zero so

167
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,080
s can go to a right with the cos2 this

168
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,960
is the only way you can go through so i

169
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,120
put a which is two right

170
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,120
okay so now the next one i want to take

171
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,479
it out is only one element so i take it

172
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:28,240
out a is two i put a in the visit set

173
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:30,880
from a i can go to b c b then i can

174
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,520
enqueue all the children so okay so a to

175
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,000
d

176
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:37,360
will be two plus four accumulate what

177
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,080
cause yeah so it will be six and s a b

178
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,039
it will be two plus three is is what is

179
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,039
five

180
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:45,120
and then e c will be

181
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,400
two plus seven will be

182
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,360
nine okay

183
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,960
yeah

184
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,599
okay and now

185
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:57,919
i continue because uh i haven't found a

186
00:06:53,599 --> 00:07:00,160
destination yet so now d is six six b is

187
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,240
five i take the fire because y is the

188
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,520
lowest cost which is the higher priority

189
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,319
i take it out

190
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,199
it's not e i continue i put b here b is

191
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,560
five

192
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:12,800
from b i can go nowhere so i stop i i i

193
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,840
just don't append and hit and now next

194
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,400
one

195
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:19,680
b and c which i should take b

196
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:22,240
because because c i take a d six

197
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,039
d i put it here six

198
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,479
six plus two is a

199
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,599
yes

200
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,520
d

201
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,680
if there's a two direction right we're

202
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,520
still not going back to a because a is

203
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,319
already in visited so we don't go back

204
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,720
yeah okay so c is a

205
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,800
and and then we for for the next round

206
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,759
we take c equals a i

207
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,240
yeah put it here c equals a

208
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,080
uh and go to f and g

209
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,160
a plus a

210
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,879
f is 16 right

211
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,599
c

212
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,400
uh

213
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:56,720
g will be a plus one would be nine right

214
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:00,080
g okay nine

215
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,120
yeah so for the next one i don't think i

216
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,360
take a c

217
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,000
but it's in already in the visited so i

218
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,039
continue i skip it yeah look yeah

219
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,680
yeah

220
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,840
so i take this i skip it and now

221
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,680
f and

222
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,560
g which i take a g right

223
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,360
yeah

224
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:21,280
i take a g i put it in here

225
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:25,170
t will go to e will be 100 e will be 100

226
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:28,660
right okay now f 16 e 100

227
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:28,660
[Music]

228
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,519
actually the cost is not 100 see is it

229
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:39,159
100 no

230
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,159
it's ssa2421

231
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:46,560
four two one is nine 109 okay sorry

232
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:48,240
i f i take x right f16

233
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,839
i put it here

234
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:54,560
so 16 plus two will be 18 so e will be

235
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,839
18. right look so

236
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,240
18

237
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,800
now the next thing look i take e which

238
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,760
is 18 right

239
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,680
okay now because i do the removed

240
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,600
remove the vertex is e is the

241
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,480
destination and i stop the action which

242
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,279
is 18 is 18 2

243
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,680
4

244
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:16,640
2 that's 8

245
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:19,200
16 18. yeah let's survive okay

246
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,360
yeah that's the uniform cost search

247
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,880
it's actually quite easy to understand

248
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,640
if you

249
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,320
if you think about references the only

250
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,640
difference is that we are using the

251
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,360
priority queue right now

252
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,360
the

253
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,080
unicorn uniform

254
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,240
cost search does not

255
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,920
i mean does not care how how many paths

256
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,760
right it only cares it's about

257
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,600
accumulate past cost right you always

258
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,600
pick pick the smallest the highest

259
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,120
priority okay so that that's right

260
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,279
quickly right the pseudoscope right a

261
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,279
little bit

262
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,560
okay

263
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,279
define

264
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,880
let's say let's say we have a

265
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:03,519
shortest path

266
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,839
on a certain path of a graph in a graph

267
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:08,160
let's define it as uh

268
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:11,440
uh you know there's a few ways to define

269
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:13,519
the graph which you can give in edges as

270
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,959
a list of edges okay so let's given the

271
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:20,720
edges and then we have a star edges

272
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:22,079
that is star and n right

273
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,959
so now g

274
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:27,920
the graph will be default dictionary

275
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:30,320
before dictionary is uh we're using the

276
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,360
adjacent list to install a graph

277
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,040
list

278
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,320
and then for

279
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,800
uh

280
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:40,240
for each edges it will be given as front

281
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:44,480
two and weight okay so for a to b we

282
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:48,240
have a cost in edges

283
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,240
now we can do this g a

284
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:55,920
okay plus equal let's pass as a b

285
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,600
the the other the the other vertex of

286
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,160
edge and the cost

287
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,160
okay now we have stored a graph we have

288
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,519
processed the edges and put it in a

289
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:07,279
graph okay now at the beginning q is a

290
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,120
priority queue right so at the beginning

291
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,720
it only

292
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,560
only contains the

293
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,720
from the star which is the

294
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,279
one which is let's say cos zero and

295
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:20,720
start with s like cos zero

296
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:22,880
yeah we put s in the q and the cost

297
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,920
from s to s is zero

298
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,480
yeah

299
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,720
okay and then y y and q look this is

300
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,040
quite similar to ppfs and now what will

301
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,680
happen we have we also have we also need

302
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,560
to

303
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,519
store a scene yeah a half set to

304
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,920
to

305
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,800
remember the set we have remember the

306
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,600
vertex we have we have visited okay

307
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,000
now

308
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,240
wire q

309
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,200
and then we have a current

310
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,560
uh

311
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,160
the current

312
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,720
um

313
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,920
we have a current cost the current cost

314
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:59,200
and the current will be equal as the

315
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:01,440
it's not q top pop left right

316
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,079
for the for the priority queue we use

317
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,200
the hip-hop remember

318
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,880
he pop

319
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,760
he pop q

320
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,839
right and then now look if the current

321
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,839
equals the distance

322
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,839
uh equals the

323
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,320
destination and we return the distance

324
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,360
between the cost right yeah

325
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,680
now we

326
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,399
the next thing is to do what if then we

327
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,480
need to check if the current is already

328
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,720
being visited soon now we'll just

329
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,480
continue here i'll just skip this one

330
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,519
and then now the next thing is go

331
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,399
through the

332
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,160
other the the neighbors of the

333
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,600
uh

334
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,120
of the current

335
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,800
so for

336
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,399
and in

337
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,519
in g

338
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,760
uh

339
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,160
g current okay

340
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,079
g current is actually you know the

341
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,000
containing a toughest array of taps

342
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:54,560
which is the vertex and the cost so we

343
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,240
have uh we need to do this as n is the

344
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,480
vertex c is the

345
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,040
uh is the cost from the cut from the

346
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,440
current to the end so now we just need

347
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:06,720
to keep uh to push this into the

348
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,160
priority queue hit pau push

349
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,360
q

350
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:13,279
and then d plus c d plus c okay d

351
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,399
because current cost is c and the new

352
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:19,519
cost is c so that the new update

353
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:22,320
accumulate cost is p plus c and then

354
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,360
vertex says n right and then if we can't

355
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,160
visit it

356
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,320
if we configure everything uh the

357
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,480
destination here we just will return

358
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,839
anything we can run or return minus one

359
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:36,240
it doesn't matter

360
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:38,079
okay look we look look at this template

361
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,000
can you see the difference between these

362
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,320
and the breakfast search can you point

363
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,320
it out

364
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,480
hip-hop yeah

365
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,560
with the preferred search we use what

366
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,880
q dot

367
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,720
top left exactly and then i know another

368
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,480
difference

369
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:02,800
another difference with the hippo what's

370
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:05,199
the arrow to push it

371
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:08,079
so here here is different right so in

372
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,959
the preferences you'll be killed a pen

373
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,199
right

374
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:13,279
so this one is picking the

375
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:15,680
the lowest and then the highest priority

376
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:18,240
which is the lowest cost right and here

377
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,959
is to pushing the kids of the

378
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,720
vertex into it and all other things are

379
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,560
quite similar okay so this is the

380
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,720
uniform cost search

381
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,120
okay so it's quite useful to find the

382
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,519
shortest path between uh in a graph with

383
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:34,800
the weighted you know with weighted it

384
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:37,360
could be directed or under

385
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,839
directed graph or undirected graph okay

386
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:44,160
it doesn't matter as long as the wages

387
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:46,800
has the weight okay if that if the wait

388
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:50,079
the c is all one and then this angular

389
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,120
will be exact exactly like the breakfast

390
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,160
okay

391
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,040
yeah

392
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,720
yeah

393
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,880
okay make sense

394
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,560
okay we'll talk about that uh in the

395
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:03,360
next few days okay

396
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,360
that's it for today bye bye
