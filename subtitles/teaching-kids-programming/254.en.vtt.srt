put the
 

81
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,350
put the
numbers at the end right or we don't

82
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:51,360
numbers at the end right or we don't
 

83
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,350
numbers at the end right or we don't
care about all the numbers at the end of

84
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:53,360
care about all the numbers at the end of

after five right
 

93
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,630
after five right
what what is this function return is you

94
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:04,640
what what is this function return is you
 

95
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,590
what what is this function return is you
need to tell me the

96
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:05,600
need to tell me the
 

97

need to tell me the
new lead the length of the new list

98
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:07,600
new lead the length of the new list
 

99
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,510
new lead the length of the new list
after removing the target

100
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:09,520
after removing the target
 

101
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,430
after removing the target
so there are two four six eight eight

so there are two four six eight eight
 

103
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,589
so there are two four six eight eight
numbers in the array and then there are

104
00:02:15,589 --> 00:02:15,599
numbers in the array and then there are
 

105
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,350
numbers in the array and then there are
three targets to remove

106

the one we don't want
it right so we can decrement one right

162
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:49,440
it right so we can decrement one right
 

163
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,110
it right so we can decrement one right
all right so what what should we do with

164

i just say this yeah okay so look

168
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:57,680
i just say this yeah okay so look
 

169
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,270
i just say this yeah okay so look
i swap it here five two

170
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:01,280
i swap it here five two
 

171
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,390
i swap it here five two
so this is the number we want to just

172
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:04,400
so this is the number we want to just
 

173
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,429
so this is the number we want to just
discard right so we decrement the

174
00:04:07,429 --> 00:04:07,439
discard right so we decrement the
 

175
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,789
discard right so we decrement the
counter here

176
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:08,799
counter here
 

177
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,470
counter here
and then five yeah

178
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:12,480
and then five yeah
 

179
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,869
and then five yeah
five okay we're going to keep it aside

180
00:04:14,869 --> 00:04:14,879
five okay we're going to keep it aside
 

181
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,469
five okay we're going to keep it aside
two what happened can you tell me

so let's return these returnees yeah

204
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:49,360
so let's return these returnees yeah
 

205
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,469
so let's return these returnees yeah
l is here okay so what's

206
00:04:52,469 --> 00:04:52,479
l is here okay so what's
 

207
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,870
l is here okay so what's
do you see one problem with this you

208
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:54,880
do you see one problem with this you
 

209
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,990
do you see one problem with this you
know in order

210
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:56,000
know in order
 

211
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,830

whether or not you know all right no no
 

213
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,510
whether or not you know all right no no
because we swap it it will be not in

214
00:04:59,510 --> 00:04:59,520
because we swap it it will be not in

and we can also do it in within order so

218
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:02,720
and we can also do it in within order so
 

219
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,390
and we can also do it in within order so
how can we do this in order

00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:04,400
how can we do this in order
 

221
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,510
how can we do this in order
we just take away it

we just take away it
 

223
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,110
we just take away it
one two two three four

227
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,230

okay so because we are doing in place

228
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:18,240
okay so because we are doing in place
 

229
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,230
okay so because we are doing in place
let's put it in the same place okay so

230
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:20,240
let's put it in the same place okay so
 

231
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,870
let's put it in the same place okay so

233
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,909

so we have a counter to put

234
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:25,919
so we have a counter to put
 

235
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,390
so we have a counter to put
we have an index a location let's say we

236
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:28,400
we have an index a location let's say we
 

237
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,390
we have an index a location let's say we
have a location j

238

239
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,830

to this this will give us the

240
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:36,840
to this this will give us the
 

241
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,430
to this this will give us the
position where we can put the

242
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:39,440
position where we can put the
 

243
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,990
position where we can put the
elements yeah we want to keep the

244
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:42,000
elements yeah we want to keep the
 

245
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,950
elements yeah we want to keep the
element yeah

246
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:42,960
element yeah
 

247
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,230
element yeah
and if it's not look one

248
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:46,240
and if it's not look one
 

249
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,230
and if it's not look one
okay one is the value we want to keep so

250
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:48,240
okay one is the value we want to keep so
 

251
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,629
okay one is the value we want to keep so
j equals zero

252
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:50,639
j equals zero
 

253
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,950
j equals zero
so i put it at here right so i override

254
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:52,960
so i put it at here right so i override
 

255
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,670
so i put it at here right so i override
it here so

256
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:53,680
it here so
 

257
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,070
it here so
one two we're going to skip these two

258
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,080
one two we're going to skip these two
 

259
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,350
one two we're going to skip these two
we want to skip these two so we don't

260
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:01,360
we want to skip these two so we don't
 

261
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,189
we want to skip these two so we don't
don't increment the j right three

262
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:05,199
don't increment the j right three
 

263
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,390
don't increment the j right three
yeah so what's the j j

264
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:08,400
yeah so what's the j j
 

265
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,230
yeah so what's the j j
will be one yeah one will be

266
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:12,240

 

267
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,550

i put it here three and then j will be

268
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:14,560
i put it here three and then j will be
 

269
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,790
i put it here three and then j will be
the next one will be two right

270
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:16,800
the next one will be two right
 

271
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,670
the next one will be two right
next one will be two so i plus one here

272
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:19,680
next one will be two so i plus one here
 

273
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,110
next one will be two so i plus one here

00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:25,120
yeah i will put it in here
 

277
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,230
yeah i will put it in here
put it in here and plus one two

278
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:28,240
put it in here and plus one two
 

279
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,670
put it in here and plus one two
skip five yeah

280
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:31,680
skip five yeah
 

281
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,830
skip five yeah
five plus one six plus one yeah

282
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:35,840
five plus one six plus one yeah
 

283
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,710
five plus one six plus one yeah
yeah easy yeah so we use one one pointer

284
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:38,720
yeah easy yeah so we use one one pointer
 

285
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,590
yeah easy yeah so we use one one pointer
to

286
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:39,600
to
 

287
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,790
to
to and then we return this uh j right

288
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:42,800
to and then we return this uh j right
 

289
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,350
to and then we return this uh j right
because j is the index that we have j is

290
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:45,360
because j is the index that we have j is

297
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,390

we want to keep it right so now we put

it at j right
 

315
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,990
it at j right
so nums num j

316
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,000
so nums num j

plus equal one remember this is that and
return we can say yeah

336
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:49,520
return we can say yeah
 

337
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,589
return we can say yeah
what's the time complexity i won i went

338
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:53,599
what's the time complexity i won i went
 

339
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,790
what's the time complexity i won i went
what's this very similarly we are

340
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:56,800
what's this very similarly we are
 

341
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,270
what's this very similarly we are
calling

342
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:57,280
calling
 

343
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,950
calling
in place yeah in place what i want oh

344
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:00,960
in place yeah in place what i want oh
 

345
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,909
in place yeah in place what i want oh
one

346
00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:01,919
one
 

347
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,629
one
okay so this is there and how about so

348
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:04,639
okay so this is there and how about so
 

349
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:05,350
okay so this is there and how about so
this

350
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:05,360
this
 

351
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,350
this
this problem is that uh the least

352
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:07,360
this problem is that uh the least
 

353
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,029
this problem is that uh the least
solution is that we keep the

354
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:09,039
solution is that we keep the
 

355
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,029
solution is that we keep the
elements in order right we're not

356
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:11,039
elements in order right we're not
 

357
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,469
elements in order right we're not
swapping it to the end yeah

358
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:12,479
swapping it to the end yeah
 

359
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:13,830
swapping it to the end yeah
remember the first one we're stopping

360
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:13,840
remember the first one we're stopping
 

361
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,469
remember the first one we're stopping
before the end okay so how do we swap it

362
00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:16,479
before the end okay so how do we swap it
 

363
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,950
before the end okay so how do we swap it
to the end so we have our left pointer

364
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:20,960
to the end so we have our left pointer
 

365
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,629
to the end so we have our left pointer
and the right pointer left pointer is

366
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:22,639
and the right pointer left pointer is
 

367
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,869
and the right pointer left pointer is
the beginning and zero the right pointer

368
00:08:24,869 --> 00:08:24,879
the beginning and zero the right pointer
 

369
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,309
the beginning and zero the right pointer
is at the end which is

370
00:08:26,309 --> 00:08:26,319
is at the end which is
 

371
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,869
is at the end which is
length lines minus one okay

372
00:08:30,869 --> 00:08:30,879
length lines minus one okay
 

373
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,230
length lines minus one okay
wire left is smaller than equal and

374
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:34,240
wire left is smaller than equal and
 

375
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,589
wire left is smaller than equal and
right okay

376
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:35,599
right okay
 

377
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,310
right okay
how about that look if norms

378
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:40,320
how about that look if norms
 

379
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,509
how about that look if norms
if nouns air equals target this

380
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:43,519
if nouns air equals target this
 

381
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,829
if nouns air equals target this
okay now we are moving the we are

382
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:45,839
okay now we are moving the we are
 

383
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:46,550
okay now we are moving the we are
swapping

384
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:46,560
swapping
 

385
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,350
swapping
right now

386
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:51,360

 

387
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,710

numbs are

388
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:54,720
numbs are
 

389
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,710
numbs are
equals we want to solve these two yeah

390
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:56,720
equals we want to solve these two yeah
 

391
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,630
equals we want to solve these two yeah
how do we swap a and b

392
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:58,640
how do we swap a and b
 

393
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,670
how do we swap a and b
how do we solve a and b a b equal as

394
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:01,680
how do we solve a and b a b equal as
 

395
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,990
how do we solve a and b a b equal as
well

396
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,000

 

397
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:14,710

baby all those ones are valid

398
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:14,720

 

399
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,710

okay so this is the python way to swap

400
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:16,720
okay so this is the python way to swap
 

401
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,670
okay so this is the python way to swap
two variables a and b okay if i don't

402
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:19,680
two variables a and b okay if i don't
 

403
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,750
two variables a and b okay if i don't
if you want to if you can't write it

404
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:21,760
if you want to if you can't write it
 

405
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,990
if you want to if you can't write it
something like that eric

406
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:24,000
something like that eric
 

407
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,230
something like that eric
a b equals b a is the same you want the

408
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:26,240
a b equals b a is the same you want the
 

409
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,590
a b equals b a is the same you want the
t equals

410
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:27,600
t equals
 

411
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,430
t equals
a a equals b and b equals one

412
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:31,440
a a equals b and b equals one
 

413
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,790
a a equals b and b equals one
t why why do we need a t here

414
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:34,800
t why why do we need a t here
 

415
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,990
t why why do we need a t here
tab out type everything

416
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:38,000
tab out type everything
 

417
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,710
tab out type everything
why do we need to save the value of a

418
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:40,720
why do we need to save the value of a
 

419
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,509
why do we need to save the value of a
because a

420
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:41,519
because a
 

421
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,070
because a
i assign it to b and b needs to assign

422
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:44,080
i assign it to b and b needs to assign
 

423
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,030
i assign it to b and b needs to assign
to y

424
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:45,040
to y
 

425
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,110
to y
to the original value of a which is

426
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:47,120
to the original value of a which is
 

427
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,310
to the original value of a which is
saving in t

428
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:48,320
saving in t
 

429
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,670
saving in t
y okay so can you tell me what what

430
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:51,680
y okay so can you tell me what what
 

431
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,870
y okay so can you tell me what what
happened what's this b

432
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:52,880
happened what's this b
 

433
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,190
happened what's this b
equals what's the problem of this i want

434
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:55,200
equals what's the problem of this i want
 

435
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,430
equals what's the problem of this i want
if i want to swap a and b b equals

436
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:57,440
if i want to swap a and b b equals
 

437
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,630
if i want to swap a and b b equals
a was b b equals a what happened

438
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:00,640
a was b b equals a what happened
 

439
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,829
a was b b equals a what happened
are these going to work is this going to

440
00:10:02,829 --> 00:10:02,839
are these going to work is this going to
 

441
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:04,310
are these going to work is this going to
work

442
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:04,320
work
 

443
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,069
work
is this going to work yeah no no why why

444
00:10:08,069 --> 00:10:08,079
is this going to work yeah no no why why
 

445
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:08,630
is this going to work yeah no no why why
not

446
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:08,640
not
 

447
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,710
not
because because um

448
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:12,720
because because um
 

449
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,829
because because um
because it will be less than yeah

450
00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:15,839
because it will be less than yeah
 

451
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,829
because it will be less than yeah
look i can show you look three and five

452
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:17,839
look i can show you look three and five
 

453
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,110
look i can show you look three and five
okay a equals three b equals five

454
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:21,120
okay a equals three b equals five
 

455
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,230
okay a equals three b equals five
a equals b then one five

456
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:24,240
a equals b then one five
 

457
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,829
a equals b then one five
five five and b equals a or five five

458
00:10:27,829 --> 00:10:27,839
five five and b equals a or five five
 

459
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:28,310
five five and b equals a or five five
right

460
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:28,320
right
 

461
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,269
right
yeah so this is not the same as look if

462
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:31,279
yeah so this is not the same as look if
 

463
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:31,750
yeah so this is not the same as look if
a

464
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:31,760
a
 

465
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,110
a
if i do this a is a is three b

466
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:35,120
if i do this a is a is three b
 

467
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,150
if i do this a is a is three b
is five and then t equals a

468
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:38,160
is five and then t equals a
 

469
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,030
is five and then t equals a
t equals a which is t equals three a

470
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:41,040
t equals a which is t equals three a
 

471
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,230
t equals a which is t equals three a
equals b

472
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:42,240
equals b
 

473
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,350
equals b
phi a equals b yeah and b equals t

474
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:47,360
phi a equals b yeah and b equals t
 

475
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,269
phi a equals b yeah and b equals t
you see 5 3 yeah i use a variable to

476
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:51,279
you see 5 3 yeah i use a variable to
 

477
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,550
you see 5 3 yeah i use a variable to
save the original

478
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:52,560
save the original
 

479
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,750
save the original
why because this is the p 4 yeah this

480
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:55,760
why because this is the p 4 yeah this
 

481
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,990
why because this is the p 4 yeah this
this will not work but in python you can

482
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,000
this will not work but in python you can
 

483
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,870
this will not work but in python you can
do this

484
00:10:58,870 --> 00:10:58,880
do this
 

485
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,990
do this
a comma b equals b comma a okay let's

486
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:02,000
a comma b equals b comma a okay let's
 

487
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,430
a comma b equals b comma a okay let's
symbol f okay so numbers

488
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:05,440
symbol f okay so numbers
 

489
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,230
symbol f okay so numbers
a along with r equals y i want to swap

490
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:08,240
a along with r equals y i want to swap
 

491
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:08,790
a along with r equals y i want to swap
it

492
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:08,800
it
 

493
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:14,150
it
lambs are i norms area

494
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:14,160
lambs are i norms area
 

495
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,150
lambs are i norms area
and then once i swap it i need to

496
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:16,160
and then once i swap it i need to
 

497
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,190
and then once i swap it i need to
decrement ah

498
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:17,200
decrement ah
 

499
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,230
decrement ah
