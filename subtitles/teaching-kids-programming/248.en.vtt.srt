1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,590

hello hello hello mr mr right now

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:03,600
hello hello hello mr mr right now
 

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,630
hello hello hello mr mr right now
all right so let's

4
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:06,640
all right so let's
 

5
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,430
all right so let's
let's look at this uh list one five

6
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:09,440
let's look at this uh list one five
 

7
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,470
let's look at this uh list one five
three

8
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:10,480
three
 

9
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,910
three
uh two one right

10
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:13,920
uh two one right
 

11
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,670
uh two one right
okay yeah one five three two one so

12
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:17,680
okay yeah one five three two one so
 

13
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,790
okay yeah one five three two one so
what's sublist service continuous

14
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:20,800
what's sublist service continuous
 

15
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,790
what's sublist service continuous
sub list okay can you give me an example

16
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:22,800
sub list okay can you give me an example
 

17
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,710
sub list okay can you give me an example
of a service one five three two

18
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:24,720
of a service one five three two
 

19
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,269
of a service one five three two
one okay that's a good example so okay

20
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:27,279
one okay that's a good example so okay
 

21
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:33,270
one okay that's a good example so okay
so one five three two one look

22
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:33,280

 

23
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,069

has the same person the last value look

24
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:36,079
has the same person the last value look
 

25
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,670
has the same person the last value look
this is the perfect example here because

26
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:37,680
this is the perfect example here because
 

27
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,750
this is the perfect example here because
the first element is one the

28
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:39,760
the first element is one the
 

29
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,910
the first element is one the
last element is also one which is the

30
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:41,920
last element is also one which is the
 

31
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,030
last element is also one which is the
same so this

32
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:43,040
same so this
 

33
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,670
same so this
is the sub list good service that has

34
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:45,680
is the sub list good service that has
 

35
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,630
is the sub list good service that has
the first and

36
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:46,640
the first and
 

37
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,630
the first and
last element is the same so how many of

38
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:48,640
last element is the same so how many of
 

39
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,189
last element is the same so how many of
those in in this list

40
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:51,199
those in in this list
 

41
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:54,630
those in in this list
how many of those six yes

42
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:54,640
how many of those six yes
 

43
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,160
how many of those six yes
six years yeah why is it six

44
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:58,170
six years yeah why is it six
 

45
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:03,110
six years yeah why is it six
[Music]

46
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:03,120

 

47
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,750

we notice that each single element is

48
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:05,760
we notice that each single element is
 

49
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,750
we notice that each single element is
the subject which is also satisfying

50
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:07,760
the subject which is also satisfying
 

51
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,950
the subject which is also satisfying
this right because they

52
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:08,960
this right because they
 

53
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,390
this right because they
for each quality service of size one the

54
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:12,400
for each quality service of size one the
 

55
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,429
for each quality service of size one the
first and the last elements also

56
00:01:15,429 --> 00:01:15,439
first and the last elements also
 

57
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,990
first and the last elements also
is also the same okay cool how can we do

58
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:18,000
is also the same okay cool how can we do
 

59
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,710
is also the same okay cool how can we do
this

60
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:18,720
this
 

61
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,469
this
how can we count it define

62
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:22,479
how can we count it define
 

63
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,590
how can we count it define
call okay let's say these nums okay

64
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:25,600
call okay let's say these nums okay
 

65
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,789
call okay let's say these nums okay
how how can we how can we

66
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:28,799
how how can we how can we
 

67
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,230
how how can we how can we
compute this list how can we count it

68
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:32,240
compute this list how can we count it
 

69
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:47,080
compute this list how can we count it
any idea answer yeah and yeah

70

we can always do what we know
 

75
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,749
we can always do what we know
usually we can do what

77
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,590

poor forcing yeah how can we prove us

78
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:01,600
poor forcing yeah how can we prove us
 

79
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,749
poor forcing yeah how can we prove us
yes

80
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:03,759
yes
 

81
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,389
yes
how can we perform

82
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:08,399
how can we perform
 

83
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,869
how can we perform
checking every surface right yeah so in

84
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:10,879
checking every surface right yeah so in
 

85
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:12,150
checking every surface right yeah so in
order to just check this out

86
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:12,160
order to just check this out
 

87
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,670
order to just check this out
because stuff is we can prove something

88
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:13,680
because stuff is we can prove something
 

89
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,190
because stuff is we can prove something
in oh and

90
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:15,200
in oh and
 

91
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,150
in oh and
what's the time from xt is n square

92
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:18,160
what's the time from xt is n square
 

93
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,550
what's the time from xt is n square
right

94
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:18,560
right
 

95
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,990
right
so look m equals length number right

96
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:24,000
so look m equals length number right
 

97
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,949
so look m equals length number right
look if these one side three to one we

98
00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:26,959
look if these one side three to one we
 

99
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,430
look if these one side three to one we
can check the pairs yeah one side

100
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:29,440
can check the pairs yeah one side
 

101
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,309
can check the pairs yeah one side
one one one five one three one two one

102
00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:32,319
one one one five one three one two one
 

103
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:32,710
one one one five one three one two one
one

104
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:32,720
one
 

105
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,470
one
two five three five two five okay yeah

106
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:36,480
two five three five two five okay yeah
 

107
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,350
two five three five two five okay yeah
so this pairs o n square because it's

108
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:39,360
so this pairs o n square because it's
 

109
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,070
so this pairs o n square because it's
what

110
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,080
what
 

111
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,869
what
is is actually n plus n minus 1 plus

112
00:02:44,869 --> 00:02:44,879
is is actually n plus n minus 1 plus
 

113
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,150
is is actually n plus n minus 1 plus
n minus 2 plus plus 1 i and this

114
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:48,160
n minus 2 plus plus 1 i and this
 

115
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,430
n minus 2 plus plus 1 i and this
is all usually is is n times n plus one

116
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:51,440
is all usually is is n times n plus one
 

117
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,030
is all usually is is n times n plus one
right divided by two but we drop a

118
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,040
right divided by two but we drop a
 

119
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,790
right divided by two but we drop a
constant the time complex is always

120
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:54,800
constant the time complex is always
 

121
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,830
constant the time complex is always
square okay

122
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:55,840
square okay
 

123
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,270
square okay
so on square answer

124
00:02:59,270 --> 00:02:59,280
so on square answer
 

125
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,309
so on square answer
equals zero for i

126
00:03:02,309 --> 00:03:02,319
equals zero for i
 

127
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:15,270
equals zero for i
in

128
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:15,280

 

129
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,110

for right in range

130
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:19,120
for right in range
 

131
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,509
for right in range
start with air and n right and then how

132
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:21,519
start with air and n right and then how
 

133
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,270
start with air and n right and then how
can we check if the first and the last

134
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:23,280
can we check if the first and the last
 

135
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,350
can we check if the first and the last
element is the same

136
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:25,360
element is the same
 

137
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:45,270
element is the same
if one if zero

138
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:45,280

 

139
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,710

so what's the value of left and right

140
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:48,720
so what's the value of left and right
 

141
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,789
so what's the value of left and right
and left value

142
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:52,799
and left value
 

143
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,710
and left value
left is index and lumps is the array

144
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:56,720
left is index and lumps is the array
 

145
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,789
left is index and lumps is the array
so what's the value of the index and air

146
00:04:00,789 --> 00:04:00,799
so what's the value of the index and air
 

147
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,070
so what's the value of the index and air
remember that day i i talked about

148
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:04,080
remember that day i i talked about
 

149
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,630
remember that day i i talked about
i and what do you put here what do you

150
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:06,640
i and what do you put here what do you
 

151
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,789
i and what do you put here what do you
put here

152
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:08,799
put here
 

153
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:26,350
put here
yeah i just send them

154
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:26,360

 

155

yeah okay so that would be the proof of

160
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:49,840
yeah okay so that would be the proof of
 

161
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,510
yeah okay so that would be the proof of
thing but

162
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:51,520
thing but
 

163
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,830
thing but
look can we do better yeah can we do

164
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:53,840
look can we do better yeah can we do
 

165
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,030
look can we do better yeah can we do
better look one

166
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:55,040
better look one
 

167
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,310
better look one
two three one let's see look

168
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:58,320
two three one let's see look
 

169
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,430
two three one let's see look
if we use the hash map to remember the

170
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:01,440
if we use the hash map to remember the

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,270
if we use the hash map to remember the
number of terms that the number

172
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:03,280
number of terms that the number
 

173
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,189
number of terms that the number
which number is appear in this one so

174
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:05,199
which number is appear in this one so
 

175
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,029
which number is appear in this one so
can we use that look

176
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:07,039
can we use that look
 

177
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,629
can we use that look
look here one appear once

178
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:10,639
look here one appear once
 

179
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,710
look here one appear once
two appear ones three appear once but

180
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:12,720
two appear ones three appear once but
 

181
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,670
two appear ones three appear once but
one here we

182
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:13,680
one here we
 

183
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,909
one here we
up to this point including this we

184
00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:15,919
up to this point including this we
 

185
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,670
up to this point including this we
appear twice so what does it mean if

186
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:17,680
appear twice so what does it mean if
 

187
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,310
appear twice so what does it mean if
this number

188
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:18,320
this number
 

189
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,110
this number
one has appeared twice including this so

190
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:21,120
one has appeared twice including this so
 

191
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,830
one has appeared twice including this so
what does it mean

192
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:22,840
what does it mean
 

193
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,749
what does it mean
we yeah because

194
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:25,759
we yeah because
 

195
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,469
we yeah because
we know it already appears up to one

196
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:28,479
we know it already appears up to one
 

197
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:29,029
we know it already appears up to one
right

198
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:29,039
right
 

199
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,670
right
one and one appears twice up to this

200
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:31,680
one and one appears twice up to this
 

201
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,870
one and one appears twice up to this
point so

202
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:32,880
point so
 

203
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,950
point so
there should be two service right there

204
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:34,960
there should be two service right there
 

205
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,670
there should be two service right there
should be two sublease which has the

206
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:37,680
should be two sublease which has the
 

207
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,510
should be two sublease which has the
first and the last element the cell

208
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:39,520
first and the last element the cell
 

209
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,909
first and the last element the cell
right okay so in order to use that

210
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:41,919
right okay so in order to use that
 

211
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,310
right okay so in order to use that
what kind of data structure are we using

212
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:44,320
what kind of data structure are we using
 

213
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:50,230
what kind of data structure are we using
no book okay

214
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:50,240

 

215
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,070

still we need to use the answer equals

216
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:52,080
still we need to use the answer equals
 

217
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,510
still we need to use the answer equals
zero okay and a notebook

218
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:53,520
zero okay and a notebook
 

219
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,309
zero okay and a notebook
let's say sin equals how do you declare

220
00:05:56,309 --> 00:05:56,319
let's say sin equals how do you declare
 

221
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,749
let's say sin equals how do you declare
a notebook

222
00:05:57,749 --> 00:05:57,759
a notebook
 

223
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:03,590
a notebook
food before before yeah

224
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:03,600

 

225
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,390

and then default type is integer okay

226
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:06,400
and then default type is integer okay
 

227
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,230
and then default type is integer okay
and then what do we do we go through

228
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:08,240
and then what do we do we go through
 

229
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,150
and then what do we do we go through
each number for i

230
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:12,160

 

231
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,870

and column number is i then we need to

232
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:14,880
and column number is i then we need to
 

233
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,629
and column number is i then we need to
update the

234
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:16,639
update the
 

235
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,070
update the
counter c i plus equals one

236
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,080
counter c i plus equals one
 

237
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,150
counter c i plus equals one
okay and then we appear including this

238
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:22,160
okay and then we appear including this
 

239
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,150
okay and then we appear including this
number up here that time so the answer

240
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:24,160
number up here that time so the answer
 

241
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,270
number up here that time so the answer
plus equal one

242
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:25,280
plus equal one
 

243
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,309
plus equal one
on the particular scene i yeah we're

244
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:28,319
on the particular scene i yeah we're
 

245
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,390
on the particular scene i yeah we're
done yeah we're super clever

246
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:30,400
done yeah we're super clever
 

247
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,380
done yeah we're super clever
yeah we tend to answer

248
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:34,390
yeah we tend to answer
 

249
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:41,990
yeah we tend to answer

[Music]
 

253
00:06:44,639 --> 00:07:05,990
[Music]
okay let's see

254
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:06,000

 

255
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:17,510

256
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:17,520

 

257
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,110

because the time complexity the blue

258
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:19,120
because the time complexity the blue
 

259
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,070
because the time complexity the blue
forces

260
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:22,080

 

261
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,589

the this method is aware right so if you

262
00:07:25,589 --> 00:07:25,599
the this method is aware right so if you
 

263
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,909
the this method is aware right so if you
put it in the term complexity if it is

264
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:27,919
put it in the term complexity if it is
 

265
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:28,710
put it in the term complexity if it is
the size

266
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:28,720
the size
 

267
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,230
the size
the size of the input n n and then

268
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:32,240
the size of the input n n and then
 

269
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,189
the size of the input n n and then
o n right this is o and i this is n

270
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:35,199
o n right this is o and i this is n
 

271
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:35,830
o n right this is o and i this is n
right size

272
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:35,840
right size
 

273
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,870
right size
n yeah and then o n is this

274
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:38,880
n yeah and then o n is this
 

275
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:44,309
n yeah and then o n is this
linear right o n square

276
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:44,319
linear right o n square
 

277
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,589
linear right o n square
okay okay so which one is better clearly

278
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:47,599
okay okay so which one is better clearly
 

279
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:47,909
okay okay so which one is better clearly
this

280
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:47,919
this
 

281
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,430
this
this is better right yeah this is one

282
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:51,440
this is better right yeah this is one
 

283
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,710
this is better right yeah this is one
this is one okay what one one

284
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:54,720
this is one okay what one one
 

285
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,309
this is one okay what one one
if there is less one one square is

286
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:56,319
if there is less one one square is
 

287
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,710
if there is less one one square is
smaller than n is bigger or equal than

288
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:58,720
smaller than n is bigger or equal than
 

289
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,510
smaller than n is bigger or equal than
one right

290
00:07:59,510 --> 00:07:59,520
one right
 

291
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,710
one right
so it's it's actually one is better than

292
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:02,720
so it's it's actually one is better than
 

293
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,469
so it's it's actually one is better than
one square because it has lower

294
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:04,479
one square because it has lower
 

295
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,510
one square because it has lower
complexity okay so that's incremental n

296
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:07,520
complexity okay so that's incremental n
 

297
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:30,560
complexity okay so that's incremental n
i know okay so i think that's right

298
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:30,570
