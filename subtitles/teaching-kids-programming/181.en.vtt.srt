and and ah
 

35
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,069
and and ah
you see that's rotating yeah

36
00:00:48,069 --> 00:00:48,079
you see that's rotating yeah
 

37
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,389
you see that's rotating yeah
yeah got it so you basically you could

38
00:00:50,389 --> 00:00:50,399
yeah got it so you basically you could
 

39
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,150
yeah got it so you basically you could
take one letter from the beginning

40
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:52,160
take one letter from the beginning
 

41
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,310
take one letter from the beginning
put it at the end or you take the take

42
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:54,320
put it at the end or you take the take
 

43
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,750

oh oh oh yeah
 

83
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,990
oh oh oh yeah
how can we do it think about it how can

84
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,000
how can we do it think about it how can
 

85
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,430
how can we do it think about it how can
we do it okay we just

86
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:23,440
we do it okay we just
 

87
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,229
we do it okay we just
move the first letter to the back

88
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:28,239
move the first letter to the back
 

89
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,710
move the first letter to the back
yeah just like yeah

90
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:32,720

 

91
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,350

so so what how can we try it

92
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:37,360
so so what how can we try it
 

93
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,710
so so what how can we try it
oh we need to first let it give it back

94
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:40,720
oh we need to first let it give it back
 

95
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,470
oh we need to first let it give it back
and then and then we'll keep moving it

96
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:42,480
and then and then we'll keep moving it
 

97
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,550
and then and then we'll keep moving it
right until until what

98
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:44,560
right until until what
 

99
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,589
right until until what
until it gets the same and

100
00:02:47,589 --> 00:02:47,599

okay so so how many times we need to try
iteration s1

114

if that's if these two strings are of
 

119
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,110
if that's if these two strings are of
different size do we need to try

120
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,120
different size do we need to try
 

121
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,190
different size do we need to try
if they're different no because that's

122
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:25,200
if they're different no because that's
 

123
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,390
if they're different no because that's
not possible right yeah

124
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:26,400
not possible right yeah

127
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,869
exactly not possible okay and if it's
the same size i can just

128
00:03:30,869 --> 00:03:30,879
the same size i can just
 

129
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:35,110

then put it at the end and check
 

135
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,430
then put it at the end and check
if it's the same right yeah can we do

136
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:41,440
if it's the same right yeah can we do
 

137
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,830
if it's the same right yeah can we do
this

so first of all how can we check if the
 

143
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,309
so first of all how can we check if the
size is different and it's not the same

size is different and it's not the same

how can we do it
 

147
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,270
how can we do it
can we do it all right yeah

yeah all right yeah so look s1
 

175
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,310
yeah all right yeah so look s1
equals i want to take the

176
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:52,320
equals i want to take the
 

177
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,030
equals i want to take the
s1 from the second letter

178
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:57,040
s1 from the second letter
 

179
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,150
s1 from the second letter
to the to the last letter right

180
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:00,160
to the to the last letter right
 

181
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,150
to the to the last letter right
one is the second letter to the last

182
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:02,160
one is the second letter to the last
 

183
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,230
one is the second letter to the last
letter minus one right

184
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:04,240
letter minus one right
 

185
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,749
letter minus one right
yeah uh actually i can take

186
00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:07,759
yeah uh actually i can take
 

187
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,990
yeah uh actually i can take
until the end as the first the second

188
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:10,000
until the end as the first the second
 

189
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,189
until the end as the first the second
letter so look at

190
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:11,199

00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:08,880
uh what's the time complexity

string and putting that
 

233
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,469
string and putting that
rearrangement of the string takes on so

234
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:26,479
rearrangement of the string takes on so
 

235
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:27,749
rearrangement of the string takes on so

243
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,749

it's hard to say because they look at

00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:39,759
it's hard to say because they look at
 

245
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,510
it's hard to say because they look at
this is the additional space

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,510
this is the additional space
right so oh and maybe not

00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:45,520
right so oh and maybe not
 

249
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:57,830
right so oh and maybe not
because we look at this one

250
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:57,840

 

251
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,870

can we do better maybe we can

252
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:00,880
can we do better maybe we can
 

253
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,990
can we do better maybe we can
can we do better anyway okay look i

254
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:04,000
can we do better anyway okay look i

what's the rotation of what's the
 

259
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,790
what's the rotation of what's the
rotation of it a b c a

260
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:12,800
rotation of it a b c a
 

261
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:21,749
rotation of it a b c a
and then

262
00:07:21,749 --> 00:07:21,759

 

263
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,790

look at what abc bca

264
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:24,800
look at what abc bca
 

265
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,629
look at what abc bca
cab do you think what's the problem do

266
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:28,639
cab do you think what's the problem do
 

267
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,430
cab do you think what's the problem do
you see what what

268
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:29,440
you see what what
 

269
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,870
you see what what
how can we do this

270
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:32,880

 

271
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,390

wait wait let me get this straight let

274
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:39,039
wait wait let me get this straight let
 

275
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,070
wait wait let me get this straight let
me have it

276
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,080
me have it
 

277
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,990
me have it
like so

278
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:44,000
like so
 

279
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,830
like so
so we can just we need to see how many

280
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:47,840
so we can just we need to see how many
 

281
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,869
so we can just we need to see how many
lenses

282
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:48,879
lenses
 

283
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,990
lenses
and we just i might i think

284
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:52,000
and we just i might i think
 

285
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,029
and we just i might i think
yeah abc whatever abc

286
00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:55,039
yeah abc whatever abc
 

287
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,830
yeah abc whatever abc
and then we go like here

288
00:07:59,830 --> 00:07:59,840

 

289
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,790

yeah i got it almost there you don't

290
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:02,800
yeah i got it almost there you don't
 

291
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,990
yeah i got it almost there you don't
need to write the

292
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:04,000
need to write the
 

293
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,469
need to write the
third one just two one right because a b

294
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:06,479
third one just two one right because a b
 

295
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:07,189
third one just two one right because a b
c a b

296
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:07,199
c a b
 

297
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,150
c a b
c you just might say a minus one look s

298
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:10,160
c you just might say a minus one look s
 

299
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,869
c you just might say a minus one look s
one plus

300
00:08:10,869 --> 00:08:10,879
one plus
 

301
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,749
one plus
s s1 that will contain all the rotation

302
00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:13,759
s s1 that will contain all the rotation
 

303
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:14,950
s s1 that will contain all the rotation
of abc right

304
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:14,960
of abc right
 

305
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,430
of abc right
look abc abc look abc is here

306
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:19,440
look abc abc look abc is here
 

307
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,950
look abc abc look abc is here
bca is here cab is here right

308
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:22,960
bca is here cab is here right
 

309
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,469
bca is here cab is here right
yeah so i just put it se s1 plus s1

310
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:26,479
yeah so i just put it se s1 plus s1
 

311
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,070
yeah so i just put it se s1 plus s1
so if s2 is the rotation of s1 or s1 is

312
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,080
so if s2 is the rotation of s1 or s1 is
 

313
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,469
so if s2 is the rotation of s1 or s1 is
the rotation of s2 i just need to check

314
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:32,479
the rotation of s2 i just need to check
 

315
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,909
the rotation of s2 i just need to check
if s2 is in there right yes

316
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:35,919
if s2 is in there right yes
 

317
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,509
if s2 is in there right yes
yeah so look i don't need this

318
00:08:39,509 --> 00:08:39,519
yeah so look i don't need this
 

319
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,750
yeah so look i don't need this
i don't need this and here you go v10

320
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:43,760
i don't need this and here you go v10
 

321
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,350
i don't need this and here you go v10
f2 in

322
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:47,360
f2 in
 

323
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,949
f2 in
x1 plus s1 well done let's see

324
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:50,959
x1 plus s1 well done let's see
 

325
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,990
x1 plus s1 well done let's see
you see simplified yeah

326
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:54,000
you see simplified yeah
 

327
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,750
you see simplified yeah
this is this and and two enchanters

328
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:57,760
this is this and and two enchanters
 

329
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,990
this is this and and two enchanters
finding in two encounters is usually

330
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:02,000
finding in two encounters is usually
 

331
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,070
finding in two encounters is usually
and the worst cases or n right but we

332
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:04,080
and the worst cases or n right but we
 

333
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,910
and the worst cases or n right but we
have better solution

334
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:05,920
have better solution
 

335
