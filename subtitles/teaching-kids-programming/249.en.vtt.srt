4 6 8
and ok 13 n o

168
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:44,400
and ok 13 n o
 

169
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,750
and ok 13 n o
p q r s t u

170
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:47,760
p q r s t u
 

171
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,190
p q r s t u
v w x y z okay

172
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:51,200
v w x y z okay
 

173
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,030
v w x y z okay
u so this is like a encrypted kind of

174
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:55,040
u so this is like a encrypted kind of
 

175
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,070
u so this is like a encrypted kind of
encrypted message

176
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:56,080
encrypted message
 

177
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:12,830
encrypted message
so you whatever

178
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:12,840

 

179
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:24,469

why

180
00:04:24,469 --> 00:04:24,479

 

181
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:34,070

my name my name is

182
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,080

 

183
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,670

hello so so look you are y p so what

184
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:37,680
hello so so look you are y p so what
 

185
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,469
hello so so look you are y p so what
if we increase you are b you become

186
00:04:40,469 --> 00:04:40,479
if we increase you are b you become
 

187
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,230
if we increase you are b you become
hello if we encrypt hollow it will

188
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:42,240
hello if we encrypt hollow it will
 

189
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:42,950
hello if we encrypt hollow it will
become your

190
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:42,960
become your
 

191
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,189
become your
b so what does it mean if a message we

192
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:45,199
b so what does it mean if a message we
 

193
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,310
b so what does it mean if a message we
encrypted twice what happened

194
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:48,320
encrypted twice what happened
 

195
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,950
encrypted twice what happened
what happened if we do this if we do

196
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:50,960
what happened if we do this if we do
 

197
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,150
what happened if we do this if we do
this draw

198
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:52,160
this draw
 

199
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,790
this draw
how we call it what 13 yeah because

200
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:54,800
how we call it what 13 yeah because
 

201
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,390
how we call it what 13 yeah because
rotating in 13 places

202
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:56,400
rotating in 13 places
 

203
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,110
rotating in 13 places
right what you have 13. if we do this

204
00:04:59,110 --> 00:04:59,120
right what you have 13. if we do this
 

205
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,150
right what you have 13. if we do this
function

206
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:00,160
function
 

207
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,430
function
is red okay so i tell you look

208
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:03,440
is red okay so i tell you look
 

209
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,710
is red okay so i tell you look
what 13 uh

210
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:06,720
what 13 uh
 

211
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,469
what 13 uh
let's do this row of 13 rod 13

212
00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:10,479
let's do this row of 13 rod 13
 

213
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,469
let's do this row of 13 rod 13
and eric what does it become

214
00:05:14,469 --> 00:05:14,479
and eric what does it become
 

215
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,469
and eric what does it become
red r-e-v-p okay and how about if i tell

216
00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:18,479
red r-e-v-p okay and how about if i tell
 

217
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:18,790
red r-e-v-p okay and how about if i tell
you

218
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:18,800
you
 

219
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:29,510
you
row of 13 again so what's the value

220
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:29,520

 

221
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,110

yeah well that's what i mean so at the

222
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:31,120
yeah well that's what i mean so at the
 

223
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,230
yeah well that's what i mean so at the
same message performing the road 13

224
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:34,240
same message performing the road 13
 

225
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,870
same message performing the road 13
twice you become you you won't be not

226
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:36,880
twice you become you you won't be not
 

227
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,670
twice you become you you won't be not
changed right

228
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:37,680
changed right
 

229
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,590
changed right
because look e perform

230
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:41,600
because look e perform
 

231
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,790
because look e perform
what's the encrypted version of the e r

232
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:44,800
what's the encrypted version of the e r
 

233
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,670
what's the encrypted version of the e r
and what's the encryption version of r e

234
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:47,680
and what's the encryption version of r e
 

235
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,310
and what's the encryption version of r e
you see

236
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:48,320
you see
 

237
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,150
you see
yeah that's what i mean yeah so that's

238

yeah that's what i mean yeah so that's
 

239
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,310
yeah that's what i mean yeah so that's
the cipher okay you know what sideways

240
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:52,320
the cipher okay you know what sideways
 

241
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,110
the cipher okay you know what sideways
yeah

right uppercase and lowercase characters
 

257
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,590
right uppercase and lowercase characters
yeah you perform this mapping

258
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:09,600
yeah you perform this mapping
 

259
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,230
yeah you perform this mapping
okay yeah okay let's write the function

260
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:12,240
okay yeah okay let's write the function
 

261
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,189
okay yeah okay let's write the function
to do this it should be very easy yeah

262
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:15,199
to do this it should be very easy yeah
 

263
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,629
to do this it should be very easy yeah
remember how do we do this

264
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:18,639

 

265
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,029

we we're going to need the two function

266
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:21,039
we we're going to need the two function
 

267
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,710
we we're going to need the two function
remember to convert

268

this time where brilliant okay and how
 

285
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:48,710
this time where brilliant okay and how
do we convert from

286
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:48,720
do we convert from
 

287
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,830
do we convert from
a to numbers which function are we using

288
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:51,840
a to numbers which function are we using
 

289
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,870
a to numbers which function are we using
um order okay and how about convert it

290
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:54,880
um order okay and how about convert it
 

291
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,990
um order okay and how about convert it
back

292
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,000
back
 

293
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,350

that's good so we we just how can we uh
 

303
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,029
that's good so we we just how can we uh
do this we want to add to 13 right

304
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:15,039
do this we want to add to 13 right
 

305
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,990
do this we want to add to 13 right
right yes okay so let's put it in an

306
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:18,000
right yes okay so let's put it in an
 

307
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,469
right yes okay so let's put it in an
array

308
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:18,479
array
 

309
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,270
array
a or equals at least yeah we put a list

310
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:21,280
a or equals at least yeah we put a list
 

311
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,270
a or equals at least yeah we put a list
and then how can we

312
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:23,280
and then how can we
 

313
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,270
and then how can we
concatenate into a final string using

314
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:25,280
concatenate into a final string using
 

315
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,629
concatenate into a final string using
which function

316
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:26,639
which function
 

317
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,469
which function
if it's a list and we want to put it

318
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:28,479
if it's a list and we want to put it
 

319
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,469
if it's a list and we want to put it
into a string remember this function

320
00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:32,479

 

321
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,430

all right
 

333
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,749
all right
all right i go into each character

334
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:49,759
all right i go into each character
 

335
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,150
all right i go into each character
so for now i will i i need to make sure

336
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:52,160
so for now i will i i need to make sure
 

337
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,749
so for now i will i i need to make sure
i need to check if it's uppercase or

338
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:53,759
i need to check if it's uppercase or
 

339
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:54,869
i need to check if it's uppercase or
lowercase right

340
00:07:54,869 --> 00:07:54,879
lowercase right
 

341
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,390
lowercase right
how can we check if it's upgrades how

342
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:56,400
how can we check if it's upgrades how
 

343
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,230
how can we check if it's upgrades how
can we check his lowercase

344
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:00,240

 

345
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,070

we just check if i is bigger

346
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:04,080
we just check if i is bigger
 

347
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,510
we just check if i is bigger
if it's bigger equal a

348
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:07,520
if it's bigger equal a
 

349
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:13,189
if it's bigger equal a
smaller equal z let's have a case yeah

350
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:13,199
smaller equal z let's have a case yeah
 

351
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,309
smaller equal z let's have a case yeah
but you can also write this if i don't

352
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:16,319
but you can also write this if i don't
 

353
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,309
but you can also write this if i don't
look look if i dot is

354
00:08:20,309 --> 00:08:20,319
look look if i dot is
 

355
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,309
look look if i dot is
upper okay let's load up case and how do

356
00:08:24,309 --> 00:08:24,319
upper okay let's load up case and how do
 

357
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,189
upper okay let's load up case and how do
we write even if lowercase

358
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:27,199
we write even if lowercase
 

359
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,469
we write even if lowercase
if i is low lower

360
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:30,479
if i is low lower
 

361
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,709
if i is low lower
and if we spoke if it's either uppercase

362
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:32,719
and if we spoke if it's either uppercase
 

363
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,389
and if we spoke if it's either uppercase
or lowercase you can do this e

364
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:34,399
or lowercase you can do this e
 

365
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,589
or lowercase you can do this e
i is alpha okay

366
00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:37,599
i is alpha okay
 

367
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,750
i is alpha okay
that means it's it's a character it

368
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:39,760
that means it's it's a character it
 

369
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,670
that means it's it's a character it
could be uppercase.lowercase if other

370
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:41,680
could be uppercase.lowercase if other
 

371
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,310
could be uppercase.lowercase if other
okay

372
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:42,320
okay
 

373
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,269
okay
so we can say okay yeah yeah alpha okay

374
00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:45,279
so we can say okay yeah yeah alpha okay
 

375
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,870
so we can say okay yeah yeah alpha okay
so is this

376
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:46,880
so is this
 

377
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,990
so is this
if i dot is upper okay it's

378
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:50,000
if i dot is upper okay it's
 

379
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,269
if i dot is upper okay it's
uppercase if i uppercase

380
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:53,279
uppercase if i uppercase
 

381
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,389
uppercase if i uppercase
then what should we do

382
00:08:56,389 --> 00:08:56,399
then what should we do
 

383
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,430
then what should we do
what should we do first of all we should

384
00:08:59,430 --> 00:08:59,440
what should we do first of all we should
 

385
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,550
what should we do first of all we should
get the

386
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:00,560
get the
 

387
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,389
get the
character yeah 65. so if it's 65

388
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:04,399
character yeah 65. so if it's 65
 

389
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,670
character yeah 65. so if it's 65
and we need to find our home we need to

390
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:07,680
and we need to find our home we need to
 

391
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:07,990
and we need to find our home we need to
find

392
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:08,000
find
 

393
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,030
find
out what's the position of it by minus

394
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,040
out what's the position of it by minus
 

395
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,509
out what's the position of it by minus
65 yeah it's home it's which characters

396
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:13,519
65 yeah it's home it's which characters
 

397
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,190
65 yeah it's home it's which characters
which alphabet

398
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:15,200
which alphabet
 

399
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,829
which alphabet
in this is 65 65 we need to map to 0

400
00:09:19,829 --> 00:09:19,839
in this is 65 65 we need to map to 0
 

401
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:20,230
in this is 65 65 we need to map to 0
okay

402
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:20,240
okay
 

403
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,430
okay
66 this is a this is b we move back to

404
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:23,440
66 this is a this is b we move back to
 

405
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,389
66 this is a this is b we move back to
one okay

406
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:24,399
one okay
 

407
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,630
one okay
first of all we go get this number we

408
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:26,640
first of all we go get this number we
 

409
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,670
first of all we go get this number we
plus 13

410
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:27,680
plus 13
 

411
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,310
plus 13
because look at mapping to m right plus

412
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:30,320
because look at mapping to m right plus
 

413
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,389
because look at mapping to m right plus
13 but it could be out of you could be

414
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:32,399
13 but it could be out of you could be
 

415
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,990
13 but it could be out of you could be
more than 26

416
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:34,000
more than 26
 

417
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,670
more than 26
then what do we do we model it as 26

418
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:37,680
then what do we do we model it as 26
 

419
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:37,990
then what do we do we model it as 26
yeah

420
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:38,000
yeah
 

421
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,630
yeah
so if it's 26 it goes back to the first

422
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:40,640
so if it's 26 it goes back to the first
 

423
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,070
so if it's 26 it goes back to the first
one am i right

424
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:42,080
one am i right
 

425
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,870
one am i right
anyway does it make sense and we get

426
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:44,880
anyway does it make sense and we get
 

427
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,150
anyway does it make sense and we get
this number then we use

428
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:46,160
this number then we use
 

429
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,030
this number then we use
which functions chr right to get a

430
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:51,040
which functions chr right to get a
 

431
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,590
which functions chr right to get a
corresponding encrypted version all

432
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:53,600
corresponding encrypted version all
 

433
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,110
corresponding encrypted version all
right

434
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:55,120
right
 

435
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,110
right
yeah i are you sure you you it's it's uh

436
00:09:59,110 --> 00:09:59,120
yeah i are you sure you you it's it's uh
 

437
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,190
yeah i are you sure you you it's it's uh
yeah for example like a

438
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:03,200
yeah for example like a
 

439
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,710
yeah for example like a
0 0 plus 13

440
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:06,720
0 0 plus 13
 

441
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,509
0 0 plus 13
modulus 26 is what is 13. what's 13

442
00:10:11,509 --> 00:10:11,519
modulus 26 is what is 13. what's 13
 

443
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,030
modulus 26 is what is 13. what's 13
what's the thing 13 is n right and it is

444
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,040
what's the thing 13 is n right and it is
 

445
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,710
what's the thing 13 is n right and it is
n n is 13 13 plus 13

446
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:18,720
n n is 13 13 plus 13
 

447
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:25,990
n n is 13 13 plus 13
modulus 26 equals 1 26 modulus 26

448
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:26,000

 

449
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,030

26 0 and 0 is 8. you see

450
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:29,040
26 0 and 0 is 8. you see
 

451
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,030
26 0 and 0 is 8. you see
so n will become a right that's what i

452
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:31,040
so n will become a right that's what i
 

453
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,509
so n will become a right that's what i
mean okay

454
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:33,519
mean okay
 

455
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,670
mean okay
yeah okay so now if i is upper

456
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:37,680
yeah okay so now if i is upper
 

457
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,910
yeah okay so now if i is upper
so i want to append a dot append

458
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:41,920

 

459
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,150

a power chr is upper is 65

460
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:46,160
a power chr is upper is 65
 

461
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,350
a power chr is upper is 65
plus order

462
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:49,360
plus order
 

463
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,790
plus order
of i

464
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:52,800

 

465
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:58,829

minus 65 right plus 13

466
00:10:58,829 --> 00:10:58,839

 

467
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:02,310

right modulus 26

468
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:02,320
right modulus 26
 

469
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,829
right modulus 26
yeah yeah okay

470
00:11:05,829 --> 00:11:05,839
yeah yeah okay
 

471
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,190
yeah yeah okay
and then if air if okay l if i go

472
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:09,200
and then if air if okay l if i go
 

473
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,750
and then if air if okay l if i go
is lower you do the same level

474
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:13,760
is lower you do the same level
 

475
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,790
is lower you do the same level
only you only change one thing which is

476
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:16,800
only you only change one thing which is
 

477
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,430
only you only change one thing which is
what

478
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:19,440

 

479
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,350

you change here from here we only only

480
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:21,360
you change here from here we only only
 

481
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,870
you change here from here we only only
change one value

482
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:22,880
change one value
 

483
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,069
change one value
if it's lowercase 96

484
00:11:26,069 --> 00:11:26,079
if it's lowercase 96
 

485
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,509
if it's lowercase 96
97. yeah you change 65 to 97 yeah

486
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:29,519
97. yeah you change 65 to 97 yeah
 

487
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,430
97. yeah you change 65 to 97 yeah
yeah because minus 697 is

488
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:33,440
yeah because minus 697 is
 

489
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,910
yeah because minus 697 is
to calculate which position in alphabet

490
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:35,920
to calculate which position in alphabet
 

491
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,150
to calculate which position in alphabet
is i plus 13 is the mapping

492
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:38,160
is i plus 13 is the mapping
 

493
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,190
is i plus 13 is the mapping

right and s if it is a other character

496
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:44,720
right and s if it is a other character
 

497
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,750
right and s if it is a other character
what do we do

498
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:45,760
what do we do
 

499
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,509
what do we do
what do we do we just append what

500
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:49,519
what do we do we just append what
 

501
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,590
what do we do we just append what
if the other characters we don't change

502
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:51,600
if the other characters we don't change
 

503
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,590
if the other characters we don't change
so in this case we obtain which

00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:53,600
so in this case we obtain which
 

505
00:11:53,600 --> 00:12:21,350
so in this case we obtain which
which variable

599
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,509
is 26 it's out of these
is here but we need to module 26 to go

600
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:45,519
is here but we need to module 26 to go
 

601
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,310
is here but we need to module 26 to go
back to a

got it yeah if it's in the second half
 

605
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:51,990
got it yeah if it's in the second half
if it's in the second half we need to

if it's in the second half we need to
 

607
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,710
if it's in the second half we need to
add 13 is out of this boundary

608
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:54,720
add 13 is out of this boundary
 

609
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,629
add 13 is out of this boundary
and we use the modulus to go back to the

610
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:56,639
and we use the modulus to go back to the
 

611
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,069
and we use the modulus to go back to the
first half to mapping

there we go b plus 13 is o is here
 

621
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,080
there we go b plus 13 is o is here
but o plus 13 where does it go
