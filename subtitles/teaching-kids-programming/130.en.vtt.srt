1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,630

hey hello mr mr ryan are you all right

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:04,640
hey hello mr mr ryan are you all right
 

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,349
hey hello mr mr ryan are you all right
yeah yeah okay so remember what we

4
00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:07,359
yeah yeah okay so remember what we
 

5
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,190
yeah yeah okay so remember what we
talked about yesterday

6
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:09,200
talked about yesterday
 

7
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,950
talked about yesterday
the only child can you only try using

8
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:12,960
the only child can you only try using
 

9
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,750
the only child can you only try using
which agreement

10
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:19,760

 

11
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,310

we are counting this uh only trial using

12
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:22,320
we are counting this uh only trial using
 

13
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,990
we are counting this uh only trial using
the preferred search okay

14
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:24,000
the preferred search okay
 

15
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,470
the preferred search okay
so how are we implementing this

16
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:26,480
so how are we implementing this
 

17
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,830
so how are we implementing this
professor

18
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:28,840
professor
 

19
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,589
professor
um level by level and what kind of data

20
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:31,599
um level by level and what kind of data
 

21
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,430
um level by level and what kind of data
structure are we using to implement

22
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:33,440
structure are we using to implement
 

23
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,110
structure are we using to implement
research

24
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:35,120
research
 

25
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,549
research
uh key yeah and the queue is first thing

26
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:38,559
uh key yeah and the queue is first thing
 

27
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,190
uh key yeah and the queue is first thing
out and in python what can or what

28
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:41,200
out and in python what can or what
 

29
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:41,750
out and in python what can or what
function

30
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:41,760
function
 

31
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,790
function
class name is the used to implement a

32
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:44,800
class name is the used to implement a
 

33
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,389
class name is the used to implement a
queue what does dee stand for

34
00:00:48,389 --> 00:00:48,399
queue what does dee stand for
 

35
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,790
queue what does dee stand for
double ended what does it mean by double

36
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:50,800
double ended what does it mean by double
 

37
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,510
double ended what does it mean by double
ended

38
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:53,520

 

39
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,670

you take it out and you put it on the

40
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:55,680
you take it out and you put it on the
 

41
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,630
you take it out and you put it on the
end

42
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:56,640
end
 

43
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,790
end
okay so basically double ended so it

44
00:00:58,790 --> 00:00:58,800
okay so basically double ended so it
 

45
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,790
okay so basically double ended so it
means that i can

46
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:00,800
means that i can
 

47
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,950
means that i can
two sides yeah well done so i can append

48
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:02,960
two sides yeah well done so i can append
 

49
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,109
two sides yeah well done so i can append
and pop from both sides okay and then

50
00:01:05,109 --> 00:01:05,119
and pop from both sides okay and then
 

51
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,070
and pop from both sides okay and then
the complexity to push and pull from

52
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:08,080
the complexity to push and pull from
 

53
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,030
the complexity to push and pull from
both sides is

54
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:09,040
both sides is
 

55
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,469
both sides is
over what's the term complexity

56
00:01:14,469 --> 00:01:14,479

 

57
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,550

constant time right yeah constant time

58
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:16,560
constant time right yeah constant time
 

59
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,990
constant time right yeah constant time
so it means that it's very quick

60
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:18,000
so it means that it's very quick
 

61
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,870
so it means that it's very quick
okay if you are if you are popping one

62
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:20,880
okay if you are if you are popping one
 

63
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,350
okay if you are if you are popping one
element from the beginning of the list

64
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:23,360
element from the beginning of the list
 

65
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,749
element from the beginning of the list
you know list remember in python we're

66
00:01:25,749 --> 00:01:25,759
you know list remember in python we're
 

67
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:26,870
you know list remember in python we're
using this

68
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:26,880
using this
 

69
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,749
using this
to represent the list if we if we pop

70
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:29,759
to represent the list if we if we pop
 

71
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:30,950
to represent the list if we if we pop
the

72
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:30,960
the
 

73
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,069
the
beginning of the list is pop zero yeah

74
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:34,079
beginning of the list is pop zero yeah
 

75
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,670
beginning of the list is pop zero yeah
from zero it takes linear time right

76
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:37,680
from zero it takes linear time right
 

77
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,910
from zero it takes linear time right
but in dq you can use top top left

78
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:41,920
but in dq you can use top top left
 

79
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,310
but in dq you can use top top left
which is a one constant so this is

80
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:44,320
which is a one constant so this is
 

81
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,069
which is a one constant so this is
better so that's why we're using dq

82
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:46,079
better so that's why we're using dq
 

83
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,270
better so that's why we're using dq
instead of list

84
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:47,280
instead of list
 

85
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,310
instead of list
to achieve this the q thing okay

86
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:50,320
to achieve this the q thing okay
 

87
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,630
to achieve this the q thing okay
so the counting only chart using the

88
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:52,640
so the counting only chart using the
 

89
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,990
so the counting only chart using the
perfect search

90
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:54,000
perfect search
 

91
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,190
perfect search
yeah we put it in the kill everything is

92
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:57,200
yeah we put it in the kill everything is
 

93
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:57,429
yeah we put it in the kill everything is
i

94
00:01:57,429 --> 00:01:57,439
i
 

95
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,990
i
went yeah when i n is what is this the

96
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:00,000
went yeah when i n is what is this the
 

97
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,630
went yeah when i n is what is this the
number of

98
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:00,640
number of
 

99
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,389
number of
notes in the premium space yes yes this

100
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:02,399
notes in the premium space yes yes this
 

101
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,469
notes in the premium space yes yes this
kind of what that was

102
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:04,479
kind of what that was
 

103
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,830
kind of what that was
it's the same so look the key

104
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:07,840
it's the same so look the key
 

105
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,150
it's the same so look the key
important things to take away here is

106
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:10,160
important things to take away here is
 

107
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:10,869
important things to take away here is
that uh

108
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:10,879
that uh
 

109
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:13,990
that uh
we are pushing the note together with

110
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:14,000
we are pushing the note together with
 

111
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,190
we are pushing the note together with
the number of

112
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:15,200
the number of
 

113
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,670
the number of
the number of children for the first

114
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:17,680
the number of children for the first
 

115
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,229
the number of children for the first
parent

116
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:18,239
parent
 

117
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,110
parent
right so then one way expand the note in

118
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:21,120
right so then one way expand the note in
 

119
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,229
right so then one way expand the note in
the next level

120
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:22,239
the next level
 

121
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,430
the next level
we can accumulate or we can we know

122
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:25,440
we can accumulate or we can we know
 

123
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,350
we can accumulate or we can we know
which are the only child by checking

124
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:27,360
which are the only child by checking
 

125
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,110
which are the only child by checking
this total if it's one

126
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:29,120
this total if it's one
 

127
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,430
this total if it's one
then it means that its parent has only

128
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:31,440
then it means that its parent has only
 

129
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,350
then it means that its parent has only
one child which is itself right

130
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:33,360
one child which is itself right
 

131
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,229
one child which is itself right
yeah okay can you put it yeah we can put

132
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:36,239
yeah okay can you put it yeah we can put
 

133
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,430
yeah okay can you put it yeah we can put
it in the answer

134
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:37,440
it in the answer
 

135
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,470
it in the answer
or yeah answer if it's a

136
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:40,480
or yeah answer if it's a
 

137
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,070
or yeah answer if it's a
integer to count how many only try we

138
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:44,080
integer to count how many only try we
 

139
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,790
integer to count how many only try we
can just

140
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:44,800
can just
 

141
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,509
can just
increment one or if you want to get the

142
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:47,519
increment one or if you want to get the
 

143
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:48,550
increment one or if you want to get the
list of the

144
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:48,560
list of the
 

145
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,390
list of the
if you want to get a list of only try

146
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:50,400
if you want to get a list of only try
 

147
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,990
if you want to get a list of only try
you can put it in the

148
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,000
you can put it in the
 

149
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,910
you can put it in the
list right and then you can count it

150
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:53,920
list right and then you can count it
 

151
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,670
list right and then you can count it
using the lens from here okay

152
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:55,680
using the lens from here okay
 

153
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,990
using the lens from here okay
basically that's what it is so we can

154
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,000
basically that's what it is so we can
 

155
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,149
basically that's what it is so we can
also solve this problem using the

156
00:03:00,149 --> 00:03:00,159
also solve this problem using the
 

157
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,229
also solve this problem using the
device search yeah so can you tell me

158
00:03:02,229 --> 00:03:02,239
device search yeah so can you tell me
 

159
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,149
device search yeah so can you tell me
what steph says

160
00:03:06,149 --> 00:03:06,159

 

161
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,270

you can't okay i'm gonna do one example

162
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:09,280
you can't okay i'm gonna do one example
 

163
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,630
you can't okay i'm gonna do one example
okay so you tell me what

164
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:10,640
okay so you tell me what
 

165
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:18,710
okay so you tell me what
what are the different search

166
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:18,720
what are the different search
 

167
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,670
what are the different search
what okay so what's the difference

168
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:21,680
what okay so what's the difference
 

169
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,190
what okay so what's the difference
search of this

170
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:23,200
search of this
 

171
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,350
search of this
of these if i want to perform the

172
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:25,360
of these if i want to perform the
 

173
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,869
of these if i want to perform the
difference one three

174
00:03:26,869 --> 00:03:26,879
difference one three
 

175
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:37,030
difference one three
eight nine seven five twelve

176
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,040

 

177
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,390

yeah okay so you go you can go

178
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:40,400
yeah okay so you go you can go
 

179
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,509
yeah okay so you go you can go
the definition is go left as much as you

180
00:03:43,509 --> 00:03:43,519
the definition is go left as much as you
 

181
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:43,830
the definition is go left as much as you
can

182
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:43,840
can
 

183
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,070
can
if not you retreat to the cheat and you

184
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:46,080
if not you retreat to the cheat and you
 

185
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,509
if not you retreat to the cheat and you
go to the right

186
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:47,519
go to the right
 

187
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,509
go to the right
and then finish it you go retrieve you

188
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:49,519
and then finish it you go retrieve you
 

189
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:50,869
and then finish it you go retrieve you
go to the right

190
00:03:50,869 --> 00:03:50,879
go to the right
 

191
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,070
go to the right
go to the left yeah okay

192
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:54,080
go to the left yeah okay
 

193
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,350
go to the left yeah okay
so using the desktop yeah yeah yeah

194
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:57,360
so using the desktop yeah yeah yeah
 

195
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,390
so using the desktop yeah yeah yeah
uh using the deficit

196
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:00,400
uh using the deficit
 

197
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,229
uh using the deficit
deficit we need to remember

198
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:04,239
deficit we need to remember
 

199
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,429
deficit we need to remember
passing down the the number of the

200
00:04:07,429 --> 00:04:07,439
passing down the the number of the
 

201
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,229
passing down the the number of the
triad of the current node right so in

202
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:10,239
triad of the current node right so in
 

203
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,470
triad of the current node right so in
the next level we can check this counter

204
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:12,480
the next level we can check this counter
 

205
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:12,949
the next level we can check this counter
if it's

206
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:12,959
if it's
 

207
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,069
if it's
one then we accumulate it right

208
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:16,079
one then we accumulate it right
 

209
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,110
one then we accumulate it right
all right yeah okay so

210
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:19,120
all right yeah okay so
 

211
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,749
all right yeah okay so
you tell me okay i tell you therefore

212
00:04:21,749 --> 00:04:21,759
you tell me okay i tell you therefore
 

213
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:22,310
you tell me okay i tell you therefore
search

214
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:22,320
search
 

215
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,350
search
let's say define define

216
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:25,360
let's say define define
 

217
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,310
let's say define define
different search and then we also need a

218
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:28,320
different search and then we also need a
 

219
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,590
different search and then we also need a
counter right

220
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:29,600
counter right
 

221
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,590
counter right
what does this counter mean can you tell

222
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:31,600
what does this counter mean can you tell
 

223
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,390
what does this counter mean can you tell
me what's missing

224
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:34,400
me what's missing
 

225
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,150
me what's missing
okay so yeah so look if loot

226
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:38,160
okay so yeah so look if loot
 

227
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,110
okay so yeah so look if loot
okay i asked you about counter things so

228
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:41,120
okay i asked you about counter things so
 

229
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,230
okay i asked you about counter things so
what's what does they mean

230
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:42,240
what's what does they mean
 

231
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,790
what's what does they mean
counter that sound was funny what does

232
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:44,800
counter that sound was funny what does
 

233
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,749
counter that sound was funny what does
the counter thing mean

234
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:47,759

 

235
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,909

that counts via constant it means that

236
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:51,919
that counts via constant it means that
 

237
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,030
that counts via constant it means that
the number of

238
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:53,040
the number of
 

239
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,629
the number of
look the counter means what it means the

240
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:56,639
look the counter means what it means the
 

241
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,390
look the counter means what it means the
the parent of the dude yeah

242
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:00,400
the parent of the dude yeah
 

243
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,110
the parent of the dude yeah
all right the parent of a root has how

244
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:03,120
all right the parent of a root has how
 

245
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,749
all right the parent of a root has how
many

246
00:05:03,749 --> 00:05:03,759
many
 

247
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,710
many
children that's for the count of me does

248
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:06,720
children that's for the count of me does
 

249
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,749
children that's for the count of me does
it make sense

250
00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:07,759
it make sense
 

251
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,550
it make sense
yeah okay so if lu is numb what's your

252
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:10,560
yeah okay so if lu is numb what's your
 

253
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,110
yeah okay so if lu is numb what's your
return

254
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:13,120

 

255
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,230

zero yeah yeah it means that nothing

256
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:16,240
zero yeah yeah it means that nothing
 

257
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:16,629
zero yeah yeah it means that nothing
yeah

258
00:05:16,629 --> 00:05:16,639
yeah
 

259
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,430
yeah
it doesn't have any homies like this

260
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:19,440
it doesn't have any homies like this
 

261
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:19,990
it doesn't have any homies like this
okay

262
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:20,000
okay
 

263
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,550
okay
so look if we have a counter here yeah

264
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:22,560
so look if we have a counter here yeah
 

265
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,189
so look if we have a counter here yeah
so look

266
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:23,199
so look
 

267
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,510
so look
answer let's say answer equals yellow

268
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:25,520
answer let's say answer equals yellow
 

269
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,469
answer let's say answer equals yellow
first right

270
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:26,479
first right
 

271
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,550
first right
and then look if counter equals one

272
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:30,560
and then look if counter equals one
 

273
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,510
and then look if counter equals one
right if it's parent if its parent

274
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:35,520
right if it's parent if its parent
 

275
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,790
right if it's parent if its parent
has only one kid then we increment the

276
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:38,800
has only one kid then we increment the
 

277
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,590
has only one kid then we increment the
answer here

278
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:39,600
answer here
 

279
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,790
answer here
answer plus equals 1 right yes

280
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:42,800
answer plus equals 1 right yes
 

281
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,469
answer plus equals 1 right yes
does it make sense okay then what should

282
00:05:46,469 --> 00:05:46,479
does it make sense okay then what should
 

283
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,070
does it make sense okay then what should
we do we should

284
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:48,080
we do we should
 

285
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,550
we do we should
this function will return the number of

286
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:50,560
this function will return the number of
 

287
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,510
this function will return the number of
the

288
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:51,520
the
 

289
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,790
the
one only triad in this root

290
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:54,800
one only triad in this root
 

291
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,670
one only triad in this root
tree in this sub tree so we also need to

292
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:57,680
tree in this sub tree so we also need to
 

293
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,550
tree in this sub tree so we also need to
add

294
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:58,560
add
 

295
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,830
add
answer equal plus equal one all right

296
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:01,840
answer equal plus equal one all right
 

297
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,510
answer equal plus equal one all right
can you write it here

298
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:03,520
can you write it here
 

299
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,189
can you write it here
this is do the left loo the left and

300
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:07,199
this is do the left loo the left and
 

301
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,670
this is do the left loo the left and
then what i think

302
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:09,680
then what i think
 

303
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,749
then what i think
okay we are missing something here okay

304
00:06:11,749 --> 00:06:11,759
okay we are missing something here okay
 

305
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,510
okay we are missing something here okay
count to something

306
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:13,520
count to something
 

307
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,790
count to something
so first of all let's say

308
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:16,800
so first of all let's say
 

309
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,870
so first of all let's say
we we are now reaching the root now

310
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:18,880
we we are now reaching the root now
 

311
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,150
we we are now reaching the root now
right but now

312
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,160
right but now
 

313
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,710
right but now
we want to know how many kids current

314
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:22,720
we want to know how many kids current
 

315
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,430
we want to know how many kids current
node has

316
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:23,440
node has
 

317
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,870
node has
right let's call it x okay x equals zero

318
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:26,880
right let's call it x okay x equals zero
 

319
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,830
right let's call it x okay x equals zero
then if roon turn left

320
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:31,840
then if roon turn left
 

321
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,550
then if roon turn left
okay so common node has the left child

322
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:34,560
okay so common node has the left child
 

323
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,430
okay so common node has the left child
right

324
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:35,440
right
 

325
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,390
right
so x plus equals one right yeah yeah and

326
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:38,400
so x plus equals one right yeah yeah and
 

327
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:38,790
so x plus equals one right yeah yeah and
then

328
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:38,800
then
 

329
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,830
then
what's happening what what's next one

330
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:41,840
what's happening what what's next one
 

331
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,230
what's happening what what's next one
plus one equal to

332
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:44,240
plus one equal to
 

333
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,830
plus one equal to
i check on the left and i also need to

334
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:45,840
i check on the left and i also need to
 

335
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,880
i check on the left and i also need to
check a lot right

336

345
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,950
this mean i think x
x what does x equal what what does x

346
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:02,960
x what does x equal what what does x
 

347
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,629
x what does x equal what what does x
mean

348

mean
 

349
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,110
mean
what's x mean why are we calculating x

350
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:07,120
what's x mean why are we calculating x
 

351
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,230
what's x mean why are we calculating x
what's x mean

352
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:10,240

 

353
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:23,189

uh x means like

354
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:23,199

 

355
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,550

what look if x equals if root is left

356
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:26,560
what look if x equals if root is left
 

357
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:26,870
what look if x equals if root is left
then

358
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:26,880
then
 

359
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,510
then
x will be one if load right and x will

360
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:29,520
x will be one if load right and x will
 

361
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,150
x will be one if load right and x will
be

362
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:30,160
be
 

363
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,990
be
plus one right so it means x is what

364
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:34,000
plus one right so it means x is what
 

365
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,749
plus one right so it means x is what
the number of what the number of nights

366
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:37,759
the number of what the number of nights

look yeah and then now
 

373
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,070
look yeah and then now
i know this x yeah then i need to plug

374
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:48,080
i know this x yeah then i need to plug

00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:36,720
that's why yeah and
 

503
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,750
that's why yeah and
the leaves the leaf notes are the notes

504
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:39,760
the leaves the leaf notes are the notes
 

505
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,990
the leaves the leaf notes are the notes
in binary tree which does not have what

506
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:44,000
in binary tree which does not have what
 

507
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,430
in binary tree which does not have what
we do not have children we are done okay

508
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:47,440
we do not have children we are done okay
 

509
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,110
we do not have children we are done okay
well let's try okay what's the term

510
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:49,120
well let's try okay what's the term
 

511
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,910
well let's try okay what's the term
complexity

512
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:51,920

 

513
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,630

what's n the numbers in the binary tree

514
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:56,640
what's n the numbers in the binary tree
 

515
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,069
what's n the numbers in the binary tree
so which one is better you think the

516
00:10:58,069 --> 00:10:58,079
so which one is better you think the
 

517
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,630
so which one is better you think the
difference search preferable search

518
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:00,640
difference search preferable search
 

519
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,829
difference search preferable search
the very same complexity yeah and which

520
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:03,839
the very same complexity yeah and which
 

521
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,110
the very same complexity yeah and which
one you think is more

522
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:05,120
one you think is more
 

523
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,949
one you think is more
easy to implement it's easier to

524
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:06,959
easy to implement it's easier to
 

525
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,030
easy to implement it's easier to
implement

526
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,040
implement
 

527
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,030
implement
but first search you in breakfast search

528
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:11,040
but first search you in breakfast search
 

529
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,069
but first search you in breakfast search
you need to

530
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:12,079
you need to
 

531
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,790
you need to
you need to implement the preferences

532
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:14,800
you need to implement the preferences
 

533
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,829
you need to implement the preferences
using the queue

534
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:15,839
using the queue
 

535
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,630
using the queue
right but here we don't use the queue we

536
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:18,640
right but here we don't use the queue we
 

537
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,630
right but here we don't use the queue we
use the stack but there is no stack here

538
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:20,640
use the stack but there is no stack here
 

539
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,190
use the stack but there is no stack here
so how

540
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:21,200
so how
 

541
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,310
so how
are we going to you where are the stack

542
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:24,320
are we going to you where are the stack
 

543
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,190
are we going to you where are the stack
here

544
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:25,200
here
 

545
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,350
here
nice there's no steps but there's

546
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:27,360
nice there's no steps but there's
 

547
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,910
nice there's no steps but there's
recursion when we talk about recursion

548
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:29,920
recursion when we talk about recursion
 

549
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,790
recursion when we talk about recursion
the computer maintains a stack for you

550
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:32,800
the computer maintains a stack for you
 

551
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,470
the computer maintains a stack for you
doesn't make sense

552
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:34,480
doesn't make sense
 

553
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,110
doesn't make sense
okay so you can implement this different

554
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:37,120
okay so you can implement this different
 

555
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,670
okay so you can implement this different
search we allow the recursion but

556
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:39,680
search we allow the recursion but
 

557
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,230
search we allow the recursion but
in that case you need to do as a stack

558
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:42,240
in that case you need to do as a stack
 

559
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,030
in that case you need to do as a stack
and then you

560
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,040
and then you
 

561
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,269
and then you
you'll be more complex that's why we

562
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:45,279
you'll be more complex that's why we
 

563
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,269
you'll be more complex that's why we
prefer using the recursion

564
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:47,279
prefer using the recursion
 

565
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,590
prefer using the recursion
the computer with maintenance stack for

566
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:49,600
the computer with maintenance stack for
 

567
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,790
the computer with maintenance stack for
you okay

568
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:50,800
you okay
 

569
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,470
you okay
so what what does it mean if there's a

570
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:52,480
so what what does it mean if there's a
 

571
00:11:52,480 --> 00:12:07,910
so what what does it mean if there's a
step what's the space complexity

572
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:07,920

 

573
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,590

okay that's it what's here

574
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:11,600
okay that's it what's here
 

575
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,829
okay that's it what's here
what's here let's see what's here hmm

576
00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:15,839
what's here let's see what's here hmm
 

577
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,629
what's here let's see what's here hmm
let me check so and answer you guys

00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:18,639
let me check so and answer you guys

what does it mean what does it mean eric
it means

it means
 

593
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,069
it means
dad what does it mean why why are we

594
00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:52,079
dad what does it mean why why are we
 

595
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,509
dad what does it mean why why are we
doing this

596
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:53,519
doing this
 

597
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,310
doing this
what's this bit what's the speed

00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,230

right yes counter if card is one then we

600
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:02,240
right yes counter if card is one then we
 

601
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:02,870
right yes counter if card is one then we
found

602
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:02,880
found
 

603
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,350
found
yeah then we found it from the current

604
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:05,360
yeah then we found it from the current
 

605
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,150
yeah then we found it from the current
note is the

606
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:06,160
note is the
 

607
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,350
note is the
only track when we add it because we're
