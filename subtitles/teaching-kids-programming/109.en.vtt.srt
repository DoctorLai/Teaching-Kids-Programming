mr and mr ryan how are you today cute
okay so today another interesting

6
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:08,000
okay so today another interesting
 

7
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,350
okay so today another interesting
problem which is called

8
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:09,360
problem which is called
 

9
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,789
problem which is called
removing the duplicate letters character

10
00:00:12,789 --> 00:00:12,799
removing the duplicate letters character
 

11
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:15,030
removing the duplicate letters character
from a string for example

12
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:15,040
from a string for example
 

13
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,550
from a string for example
b b a b c

14
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:20,560

 

15
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,189

a okay so if you keep removing look

16
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:23,199
a okay so if you keep removing look
 

17
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,509
a okay so if you keep removing look
there are duplicates

18
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:25,519
there are duplicates
 

19
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,029
there are duplicates
look you're fine okay too deep okay

20
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:29,039
look you're fine okay too deep okay
 

21
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,310
look you're fine okay too deep okay
so you know it will become a a b c

22
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:32,320
so you know it will become a a b c
 

23
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,270
so you know it will become a a b c
and then look hey remove it so you

24
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:35,280
and then look hey remove it so you
 

25
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,229
and then look hey remove it so you
become bc

26
00:00:36,229 --> 00:00:36,239
become bc
 

27
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,910
become bc
okay so i give you at least you need to

28
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:37,920
okay so i give you at least you need to
 

29
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,670
okay so i give you at least you need to
tell me this

30
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:39,680
tell me this
 

31
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,430
tell me this
okay just use a notebook not exactly but

32
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:43,440
okay just use a notebook not exactly but
 

33
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:43,750
okay just use a notebook not exactly but
look

34
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:43,760
look
 

35
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,229
look
if it's a pairing drum what will happen

36
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:46,239
if it's a pairing drum what will happen
 

37
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,310
if it's a pairing drum what will happen
a a

38
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:48,320
a a
 

39
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,430
a a
or maybe a b c c

40
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:51,440
or maybe a b c c
 

41
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,470
or maybe a b c c
b a okay so what c c

42
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:54,480
b a okay so what c c
 

43
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,670
b a okay so what c c
if it's definitely a b b a now look

44
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:57,680
if it's definitely a b b a now look
 

45
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,670
if it's definitely a b b a now look
when you do this there will be abba and

46
00:00:59,670 --> 00:00:59,680
when you do this there will be abba and
 

47
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,830
when you do this there will be abba and
you can continue removing

48
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:01,840
you can continue removing
 

49
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,109
you can continue removing
a b c d a yeah a b

50
00:01:05,109 --> 00:01:05,119
a b c d a yeah a b
 

51
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,550
a b c d a yeah a b
c b a then it will not be

52
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:08,560
c b a then it will not be
 

53
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,550
c b a then it will not be
any anything because you can't remove

54
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:10,560
any anything because you can't remove
 

55
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,230
any anything because you can't remove
any duplicator it's not duplicate

56
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:12,240
any duplicator it's not duplicate
 

57
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,670
any duplicator it's not duplicate
only if it's a range penetrant and

58
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:15,680
only if it's a range penetrant and
 

59
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,390
only if it's a range penetrant and
it's a even number and then you like

60
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:18,400
it's a even number and then you like
 

61
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,469
it's a even number and then you like
this even number of pending drum

62
00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:20,479
this even number of pending drum
 

63
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,270
this even number of pending drum
and you can keep removing keep removing

64
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:23,280
and you can keep removing keep removing
 

65
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,710
and you can keep removing keep removing
until it's empty okay

66
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:24,720
until it's empty okay
 

67
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,510
until it's empty okay
so basically you're giving a string keep

68
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:27,520
so basically you're giving a string keep
 

69
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,069
so basically you're giving a string keep
removing the duplicate

70
00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:30,079
removing the duplicate
 

71
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,910
removing the duplicate
two letters neighboring yeah sensitive

72
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:33,920
two letters neighboring yeah sensitive
 

73
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,190
two letters neighboring yeah sensitive
letters and here you can't do it anymore

74
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:37,200
letters and here you can't do it anymore
 

75
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,429
letters and here you can't do it anymore
correct so how can we do it any idea

76
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:41,439
correct so how can we do it any idea
 

77
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,190
correct so how can we do it any idea
no why do i want to use a notebook cash

78
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:45,200
no why do i want to use a notebook cash
 

79
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,469
no why do i want to use a notebook cash
how how would you do it no how would you

80
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:48,479
how how would you do it no how would you
 

81
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,510
how how would you do it no how would you
do it i'm not

82
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:49,520
do it i'm not
 

83
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,109
do it i'm not
asking how many moves i'm asking the

84
00:01:53,109 --> 00:01:53,119
asking how many moves i'm asking the
 

85
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,469
asking how many moves i'm asking the
final string so you actually need to

86
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:56,479
final string so you actually need to
 

87
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,310
final string so you actually need to
search for the duplicate

88
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:58,320
search for the duplicate
 

89
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,109
search for the duplicate
letters right yeah how to do it

90
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:03,119
letters right yeah how to do it
 

91
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,230
letters right yeah how to do it
how to do it normally you know just

92
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:06,240
how to do it normally you know just
 

93
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,389
how to do it normally you know just
intuitively the straightforward you

94
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:08,399
intuitively the straightforward you
 

95
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,309
intuitively the straightforward you
don't have the first one

96
00:02:10,309 --> 00:02:10,319
don't have the first one
 

97
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,190
don't have the first one
you check the others if they're the same

98
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:13,200
you check the others if they're the same
 

99
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,710
you check the others if they're the same
so basically you can do this

100
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:14,720
so basically you can do this
 

101
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,670
so basically you can do this
checking in the same no you're the same

102
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:17,680
checking in the same no you're the same
 

103
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,589
checking in the same no you're the same
then remove it yeah

104
00:02:19,589 --> 00:02:19,599
then remove it yeah
 

105
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:25,190
then remove it yeah
and then how about this a a

106
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:25,200

 

107
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:34,830

can you go like that then no but this is

108
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:34,840

 

109
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,270

removed

110
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:37,280
removed
 

111
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,670
removed
the thing is when you get rid of this

112
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:39,680
the thing is when you get rid of this
 

113
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,110
the thing is when you get rid of this
and then

114
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:41,120
and then
 

115
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,869
and then
you need to remove this how would you

116
00:02:42,869 --> 00:02:42,879
you need to remove this how would you
 

117
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,630
you need to remove this how would you
able to remove this

118
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:44,640
able to remove this
 

119
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,670
able to remove this
you just started again good point so

120
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:47,680
you just started again good point so
 

121
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,430
you just started again good point so
basically you find any two

122
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:49,440
basically you find any two
 

123
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,070
basically you find any two
you remove it and then the problem

124
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:52,080
you remove it and then the problem
 

125
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,589
you remove it and then the problem
becomes smaller right

126
00:02:53,589 --> 00:02:53,599
becomes smaller right
 

127
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,910
becomes smaller right
yeah because you remove it it becomes

128
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:55,920
yeah because you remove it it becomes
 

129
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,949
yeah because you remove it it becomes
aabc

130
00:02:56,949 --> 00:02:56,959
aabc
 

131
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,589
aabc
and how about we apply this algorithm to

132
00:02:59,589 --> 00:02:59,599
and how about we apply this algorithm to
 

133
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,190
and how about we apply this algorithm to
this new string again

134
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:01,200
this new string again
 

135
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,070
this new string again
and here we can delete it so this looks

136
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:04,080
and here we can delete it so this looks
 

137
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,309
and here we can delete it so this looks
okay you find two letters

138
00:03:06,309 --> 00:03:06,319
okay you find two letters
 

139
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,470
okay you find two letters
and then bc okay and then you can't

140
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:08,480
and then bc okay and then you can't
 

141
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,390
and then bc okay and then you can't
remove it and we determine pc

142
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:10,400
remove it and we determine pc
 

143
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,430
remove it and we determine pc
all right okay so let's try this

144
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:13,440
all right okay so let's try this
 

145
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,630
all right okay so let's try this
problem define

146
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:16,640
problem define
 

147
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,830
problem define
let's do it f okay f s

148
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:19,840
let's do it f okay f s
 

149
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,270
let's do it f okay f s
what's missing

150
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:23,280

 

151
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,470

try to be more upbeat okay so look

152
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:28,480

 

153
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:35,270

it might not work and equals

154
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:35,280

 

155
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,710

yeah okay then let's start from

156
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:38,720
yeah okay then let's start from
 

157
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,229
yeah okay then let's start from
i in range it might not work

158
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:44,239

 

159
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,470

look why it might not work because

160
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:47,480
look why it might not work because
 

161
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,550
look why it might not work because
b-a-c-a

162
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:49,560
b-a-c-a
 

163
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,550
b-a-c-a
b-a-c-a what then you'll return just

164
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:52,560
b-a-c-a what then you'll return just
 

165
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,550
b-a-c-a what then you'll return just
lieutenant original because look you

166
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:54,560
lieutenant original because look you
 

167
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,550
lieutenant original because look you
can't find any two duplicates

168
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:56,560
can't find any two duplicates
 

169
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:04,149
can't find any two duplicates
yeah and you can say

170
00:04:04,149 --> 00:04:04,159

 

171
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,910

they have to be next to each other

172
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:07,920
they have to be next to each other
 

173
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,110
they have to be next to each other
oh yeah okay okay so look i need that

174
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:11,120
oh yeah okay okay so look i need that
 

175
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,070
oh yeah okay okay so look i need that
one so we start from the first integer

176
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:14,080
one so we start from the first integer
 

177
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,190
one so we start from the first integer
first one we forgot

178
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:15,200
first one we forgot
 

179
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,550
first one we forgot
column yeah yeah look everything so a a

180
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:18,560
column yeah yeah look everything so a a
 

181
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,830
column yeah yeah look everything so a a
b c a okay so we start from one so

182
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:21,840
b c a okay so we start from one so
 

183
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,629
b c a okay so we start from one so
we start i from one one yeah but we

184
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:24,639
we start i from one one yeah but we
 

185
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,110
we start i from one one yeah but we
checked

186
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:25,120
checked
 

187
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,710
checked
its previous one yeah right yeah

188
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:28,720
its previous one yeah right yeah
 

189
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,749
its previous one yeah right yeah
so if s i equals

190
00:04:31,749 --> 00:04:31,759
so if s i equals
 

191
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,590
so if s i equals
s i minus one column yeah look

192
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:35,600
s i minus one column yeah look
 

193
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,189
s i minus one column yeah look
if this character is is the same as its

194
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:39,199
if this character is is the same as its
 

195
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,749
if this character is is the same as its
previous one which is i minus one yeah

196
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:41,759
previous one which is i minus one yeah
 

197
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,030
previous one which is i minus one yeah
that was what happened we can call this

198
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:45,040
that was what happened we can call this
 

199
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,950
that was what happened we can call this
cell 7 we can

200
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:46,960
cell 7 we can
 

201
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,070
cell 7 we can
why isn't the first one look look

202
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,080
why isn't the first one look look
 

203
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,270
why isn't the first one look look
sorry y i is a first one i

204
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:53,280
sorry y i is a first one i
 

205
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,830
sorry y i is a first one i
this is one this is yellow one we start

206
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:55,840
this is one this is yellow one we start
 

207
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,469
this is one this is yellow one we start
from i

208
00:04:56,469 --> 00:04:56,479
from i
 

209
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,950
from i
you know because we want to check next

210
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:58,960
you know because we want to check next
 

211
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,390
you know because we want to check next
previous one right

212
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:00,400
previous one right
 

213
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,550
previous one right
look this is the same look if i

214
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:04,560
look this is the same look if i
 

215
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,830
look this is the same look if i
is smaller than i minus one okay so what

216
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:07,840
is smaller than i minus one okay so what
 

217
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,870
is smaller than i minus one okay so what
happens

218
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:08,880
happens
 

219
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,550
happens
so for example there are another

220
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:10,560
so for example there are another
 

221
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,909
so for example there are another
character here okay so

222
00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:11,919
character here okay so
 

223
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,790
character here okay so
we want to skip these two right yeah we

224
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:14,800
we want to skip these two right yeah we
 

225
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,150
we want to skip these two right yeah we
want to peel the string c

226
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:16,160
want to peel the string c
 

227
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,350
want to peel the string c
b c a right on opca which is nothing

228
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:19,360
b c a right on opca which is nothing
 

229
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,189
b c a right on opca which is nothing
so return what f this look we're calling

230
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:23,199
so return what f this look we're calling
 

231
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:23,990
so return what f this look we're calling
itself to solve

232
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,000
itself to solve
 

233
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,749
itself to solve
a smaller problem we allow these two

234
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:25,759
a smaller problem we allow these two
 

235
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,510
a smaller problem we allow these two
characters all right

236
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:27,520
characters all right
 

237
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,029
characters all right
yeah so that would be s

238
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:31,039
yeah so that would be s
 

239
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,150
yeah so that would be s
column column yeah i minus one

240
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:34,160
column column yeah i minus one
 

241
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,550
column column yeah i minus one
so that's the previous part i minus one

242
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:36,560
so that's the previous part i minus one
 

243
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,590
so that's the previous part i minus one
plus

244
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:37,600
plus
 

245
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,710
plus
s this is i yeah i plus one yeah

246
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:42,720
s this is i yeah i plus one yeah
 

247
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,629
s this is i yeah i plus one yeah
column yeah it means to start from i

248
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:44,639
column yeah it means to start from i
 

249
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:45,990
column yeah it means to start from i
plus one to the n

250
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:46,000
plus one to the n
 

251
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,150
plus one to the n
this is mean from beginning to i minus

252
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:48,160
this is mean from beginning to i minus
 

253
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,350
this is mean from beginning to i minus
one yeah

254
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:49,360
one yeah
 

255
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,670
one yeah
all right so calling itself to solve a

256
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:51,680
all right so calling itself to solve a
 

257
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,749
all right so calling itself to solve a
smaller problem yeah

258
00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:53,759
smaller problem yeah
 

259
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,749
smaller problem yeah
and then if if you reach this end what

260
00:05:55,749 --> 00:05:55,759
and then if if you reach this end what
 

261
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:56,870
and then if if you reach this end what
should we return

262
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:56,880
should we return
 

263
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,390
should we return
can you tell me what should we return

264
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:58,400
can you tell me what should we return
 

265
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,189
can you tell me what should we return
here guess well i am way

266
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:01,199
here guess well i am way
 

267
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:09,920
here guess well i am way
so no look and return

look if you find if you can't find any
 

273
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,230
look if you find if you can't find any
any two characters yeah

274
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:18,240
any two characters yeah
 

275
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,469
any two characters yeah
and this will not get into the this

that
one look at

00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:45,039
one look at
 

297
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,150
one look at
abc cbi look i tell you why it's a n

298

abc cbi look i tell you why it's a n
 

299
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,110
abc cbi look i tell you why it's a n
square look quadratic look yeah look

300
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:51,120
square look quadratic look yeah look
 

301
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,029
square look quadratic look yeah look
it's a square

302
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:53,039
it's a square
 

303
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,070
it's a square
n look yeah this is calling itself and

304
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:56,080
n look yeah this is calling itself and
 

305
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,790
n look yeah this is calling itself and
look look

306
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:56,800
look look
 

307
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,589
look look
a b c okay i find a duplicate yeah yeah

308
00:06:59,589 --> 00:06:59,599
a b c okay i find a duplicate yeah yeah
 

309
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,909
a b c okay i find a duplicate yeah yeah
i find that duplicated

310
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:03,919

 

311
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,430

but i need to go start from the

312
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:05,440
but i need to go start from the
 

313
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,110
but i need to go start from the
beginning to check these again

314
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:07,120
beginning to check these again
 

315
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,990
beginning to check these again
right yeah every time you need to go n

316
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:10,000
right yeah every time you need to go n
 

317
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,110
right yeah every time you need to go n
to go and go and

318
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:11,120
to go and go and
 

319
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,589
to go and go and
then let n times then there will be n

320
00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:13,599
then let n times then there will be n
 

321
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,990
then let n times then there will be n
squared in a scale n square okay

322
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:16,000
squared in a scale n square okay
 

323
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,830
squared in a scale n square okay
can we do better can we do better

324
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:19,840
can we do better can we do better
 

325
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,749
can we do better can we do better
do we need to actually we want it

326
00:07:21,749 --> 00:07:21,759
do we need to actually we want it
 

327
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,670
do we need to actually we want it
because the problem is that when you

328
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:23,680
because the problem is that when you
 

329
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,189
because the problem is that when you
do this a b c b c b a

330
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:27,199
do this a b c b c b a
 

331
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,309
do this a b c b c b a
when you find this duplicate right you

332
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:30,319
when you find this duplicate right you
 

333
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,710
when you find this duplicate right you
are rewinding to from the beginning yeah

334
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:32,720
are rewinding to from the beginning yeah
 

335
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,749
are rewinding to from the beginning yeah
if there are any

336
00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:33,759
if there are any
 

337
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,909
if there are any
characters there you need to go back and

338
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:35,919
characters there you need to go back and
 

339
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,189
characters there you need to go back and
then do it again

340
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:37,199
then do it again
 

341
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,070
then do it again
but actually we don't need to right yes

342
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,080
but actually we don't need to right yes
 

343
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,469
but actually we don't need to right yes
we just need to go back to once yeah

344
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:42,479
we just need to go back to once yeah
 

345
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,469
we just need to go back to once yeah
because look this is delete and we just

346
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:44,479
because look this is delete and we just
 

347
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,390
because look this is delete and we just
need to find out the previous one if his

348
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:46,400
need to find out the previous one if his
 

349
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,350
need to find out the previous one if his
next one

350
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:47,360
next one
 

351
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,350
next one
if it's then we remove it and keep

352
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:49,360
if it's then we remove it and keep
 

353
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,550
if it's then we remove it and keep
removing yeah

354
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:50,560
removing yeah
 

355
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,070
removing yeah
do you get it if there are lots of

356
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,080
do you get it if there are lots of
 

357
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,909
do you get it if there are lots of
characters here and then you have

358
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:53,919
characters here and then you have
 

359
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,869
characters here and then you have
bb here right these are not they are not

360
00:07:56,869 --> 00:07:56,879
bb here right these are not they are not
 

361
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,029
bb here right these are not they are not
duplicate numbers here

362
00:07:59,029 --> 00:07:59,039
duplicate numbers here
 

363
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,869
duplicate numbers here
yeah if you find these two the same

364
00:08:02,869 --> 00:08:02,879
yeah if you find these two the same
 

365
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:03,990
yeah if you find these two the same
you don't need to go back to the

366
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:04,000
you don't need to go back to the
 

367
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,589
you don't need to go back to the
beginning to check please because you

368
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:05,599
beginning to check please because you
 

369
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,270
beginning to check please because you
already know

370
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:07,280
already know
 

371
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,350
already know
if there's no duplicate all right yeah

372
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:09,360
if there's no duplicate all right yeah
 

373
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,270
if there's no duplicate all right yeah
the only difference is this one previous

374
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:11,280
the only difference is this one previous
 

375
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,629
the only difference is this one previous
one could be the same as the next one

376
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:14,639
one could be the same as the next one
 

377
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,790
one could be the same as the next one
does it make sense yeah does it make

378
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:16,800
does it make sense yeah does it make
 

379
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,390
does it make sense yeah does it make
sense yeah

380
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:18,400
sense yeah
 

381
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,749
sense yeah
so we can use the data structure called

382
00:08:21,749 --> 00:08:21,759
so we can use the data structure called
 

383
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,029
so we can use the data structure called
call stack look what's that

384
00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:25,039
call stack look what's that
 

385
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,309
call stack look what's that
can you can you remind me what's

386
00:08:26,309 --> 00:08:26,319
can you can you remind me what's
 

387
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,070
can you can you remind me what's
happening

388
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,080

 

389
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,990

first thing that's stopped okay so look

390
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:32,000
first thing that's stopped okay so look
 

391
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,670
first thing that's stopped okay so look
i have a stack

392
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:33,680
i have a stack
 

393
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,190
i have a stack
yeah look look a b

394
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:37,200
yeah look look a b
 

395
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,870
yeah look look a b
c uh cba okay

396
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:40,880
c uh cba okay
 

397
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,589
c uh cba okay
yeah look at this this string okay i

398
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:43,599
yeah look at this this string okay i
 

399
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:44,389
yeah look at this this string okay i
have a stack

400
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:44,399
have a stack
 

401
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,990
have a stack
okay i have a stack

402
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:48,000
okay i have a stack
 

403
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,430
okay i have a stack
okay hey hey look everything

404
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:51,440
okay hey hey look everything
 

405
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,430
okay hey hey look everything
yeah i look at the string i here s i

406
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:55,440
yeah i look at the string i here s i
 

407
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,790
yeah i look at the string i here s i
a is it the same as as the previous

408
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:58,800
a is it the same as as the previous
 

409
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,870
a is it the same as as the previous
as the top of the stack the stack is

410
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:00,880
as the top of the stack the stack is
 

411
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,150
as the top of the stack the stack is
empty now right

412
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:02,160
empty now right
 

413
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,269
empty now right
so it's not the same i push it here

414
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:05,279
so it's not the same i push it here
 

415
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,990
so it's not the same i push it here
yeah put a stack here look look at this

416
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:08,000
yeah put a stack here look look at this
 

417
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,030
yeah put a stack here look look at this
step yeah

418
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,040
step yeah
 

419
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,710
step yeah
and i move it to here is b

420
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:12,720
and i move it to here is b
 

421
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,070
and i move it to here is b
the same as a no no i put it push

422
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:16,080
the same as a no no i put it push
 

423
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,190
the same as a no no i put it push
in b yeah look then c c

424
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:19,200
in b yeah look then c c
 

425
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,230
in b yeah look then c c
is is it the same as the top of step

426
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:22,240
is is it the same as the top of step
 

427
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,310
is is it the same as the top of step
no i push it in c okay and then look

428
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:26,320
no i push it in c okay and then look
 

429
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,190
no i push it in c okay and then look
you see top look the same as the top of

430
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:29,200
you see top look the same as the top of
 

431
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,710
you see top look the same as the top of
the stack

432
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:30,720
the stack
 

433
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,310
the stack
yes then what do we do we take out

434
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:34,320
yes then what do we do we take out
 

435
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,790
yes then what do we do we take out
love it out yeah we eat it we eat it and

436
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:36,800
love it out yeah we eat it we eat it and
 

437
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,070
love it out yeah we eat it we eat it and
then we keep going

438
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:38,080
then we keep going
 

439
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,190
then we keep going
look the top of that then i'm b we are b

440
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:41,200
look the top of that then i'm b we are b
 

441
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,110
look the top of that then i'm b we are b
now it's b the tuple of step yeah

442
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:45,120
now it's b the tuple of step yeah
 

443
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,030
now it's b the tuple of step yeah
i eat it and i move it to a it's a

444
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:49,040
i eat it and i move it to a it's a
 

445
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,430
i eat it and i move it to a it's a
topless deck yeah okay so let's

446
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:53,440
topless deck yeah okay so let's
 

447
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,110
topless deck yeah okay so let's
put nothing look look if there are

448
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:55,120
put nothing look look if there are
 

449
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,470
put nothing look look if there are
anything there like d

450
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:56,480
anything there like d
 

451
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,190
anything there like d
here and then go here it's b component

452
00:09:59,190 --> 00:09:59,200
here and then go here it's b component
 

453
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,470
here and then go here it's b component
the simulator is that

454
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:00,480
the simulator is that
 

455
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,590
the simulator is that
no i push it in d okay

456
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:03,600
no i push it in d okay
 

457
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,710
no i push it in d okay
so the answer would be in a step

458
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:08,720
so the answer would be in a step
 

459
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,750
so the answer would be in a step
bad yeah okay so

460
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:11,760
bad yeah okay so
 

461
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,310
bad yeah okay so
look let's let's do this another e here

462
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:14,320
look let's let's do this another e here
 

463
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,350
look let's let's do this another e here
so you'll be

464
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:15,360
so you'll be
 

465
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:23,750
so you'll be
you'll be look e

466
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:23,760

 

467
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,790

yeah b i eat it a i eat it

468
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:26,800
yeah b i eat it a i eat it
 

469
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,790
yeah b i eat it a i eat it
b i push it in so the answer will be e b

470
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:30,800
b i push it in so the answer will be e b
 

471
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,350
b i push it in so the answer will be e b
when you when you pop out let's reverse

472
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:33,360
when you when you pop out let's reverse
 

473
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,990
when you when you pop out let's reverse
all the time

474
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:36,000

 

475
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,190

in okay so

476
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:39,200
in okay so
 

477
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,350
in okay so
look we can do this yeah we can do a

478
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:41,360
look we can do this yeah we can do a
 

479
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,389
look we can do this yeah we can do a
list

480
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:42,399
list
 

481
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,829
list
and then in each in python we can use

482
00:10:45,829 --> 00:10:45,839
and then in each in python we can use
 

483
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,509
and then in each in python we can use
the list to

484
00:10:47,509 --> 00:10:47,519
the list to
 

485
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,030
the list to
at least at least to to simulate the

486
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,040
at least at least to to simulate the
 

487
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,870
at least at least to to simulate the
stack yeah okay all right

488
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:54,880
stack yeah okay all right
 

489
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,829
stack yeah okay all right
invite this a little bit look

490
00:10:58,829 --> 00:10:58,839

 

491
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:02,150

step step equals look

492
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:02,160
step step equals look
 

493
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,790
step step equals look
yeah this is empty stack yeah at least

494
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:04,800
yeah this is empty stack yeah at least
 

495
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,230
yeah this is empty stack yeah at least
empty stack

496
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:06,240
empty stack
 

497
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,590
empty stack
four

498
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:09,600

 

499
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,350

x what's called what's missing here okay

500
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:13,360
x what's called what's missing here okay
 

501
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,389
x what's called what's missing here okay
look if we said we need to get ahead of

502
00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:16,399
look if we said we need to get ahead of
 

503
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:16,790
look if we said we need to get ahead of
that

504
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:16,800
that
 

505
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,910
that
step but if if the stack is empty we

506
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:19,920
step but if if the stack is empty we
 

507
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,670
step but if if the stack is empty we
we don't want to get it yeah because if

508
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:21,680
we don't want to get it yeah because if
 

509
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,590
we don't want to get it yeah because if
the stack is empty there's no way to get

510
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:23,600
the stack is empty there's no way to get
 

511
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,470
the stack is empty there's no way to get
the top of step

512
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:24,480
the top of step
 

513
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:37,350
the top of step
right so we need to say if then

514
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:37,360

 

515
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,470

i is not equal

516
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:40,480
i is not equal
 

517
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,269
i is not equal
to to the top of the stack what's the

518
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:43,279
to to the top of the stack what's the
 

519
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,470
to to the top of the stack what's the
top of the stack

520
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:44,480
top of the stack
 

521
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,190
top of the stack
so it's look thing look look at i minus

522
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:47,200
so it's look thing look look at i minus
 

523
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:47,829
so it's look thing look look at i minus
i

524
00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:47,839
i
 

525
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,710
i
b c you push it to abc what's the top of

526
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:50,720
b c you push it to abc what's the top of
 

527
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,590
b c you push it to abc what's the top of
the stack

528
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:51,600
the stack
 

529
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,790
the stack
c or a c yeah you just looking this way

530
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:54,800
c or a c yeah you just looking this way
 

531
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,590
c or a c yeah you just looking this way
you push d let d will be the top step

532
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:57,600
you push d let d will be the top step
 

533
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,150
you push d let d will be the top step
yeah

534
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:58,160
yeah
 

535
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,190
yeah
rotating 90 degree yeah okay if i

536
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:01,200
rotating 90 degree yeah okay if i
 

537
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,750
rotating 90 degree yeah okay if i
know not equal to st minus one yeah

538
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:05,760
know not equal to st minus one yeah
 

539
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,949
know not equal to st minus one yeah
if the step is empty or the top is not

540
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:08,959
if the step is empty or the top is not
 

541
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,670
if the step is empty or the top is not
equal to the new element we push it in

542
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:11,680
equal to the new element we push it in
 

543
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,310
equal to the new element we push it in
right so

544
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:12,320
right so
 

545
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,430
right so
st dot append all right

546
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:15,440
st dot append all right
 

547
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,110
st dot append all right
okay what open what depend

555
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,710
is not empty yeah it's not empty
and and i

556
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:44,720
and and i
 

557
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,870
and and i
equals to the top of the stack reversely

558
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:46,880

then we need to pop it yeah pop it pop

562
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:51,920
then we need to pop it yeah pop it pop
 

563
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,790
then we need to pop it yeah pop it pop
so probably

564
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:52,800
so probably
 

565
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,310

look at a b c look at now

now the next thing you see yeah c
 

569
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,350
now the next thing you see yeah c
is the same as the top of the stack

abc we want to look yeah
 

597
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,629
abc we want to look yeah
okay look look

598
00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:40,639
okay look look
 

599
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,750
okay look look
look now suppose the final stack

600
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:43,760
look now suppose the final stack
 

601
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,030
look now suppose the final stack
is a b c let's stay so what's the final

602
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:47,040
is a b c let's stay so what's the final
 

603
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,350
is a b c let's stay so what's the final
string is it cba or abc

604
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:49,360
string is it cba or abc
 

605
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,790
string is it cba or abc
abc abc yeah so now this is an array we

606
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:52,800
abc abc yeah so now this is an array we
 

607
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,350
abc abc yeah so now this is an array we
want to

608
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:53,360
want to
 

609
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,389
want to
make abc into a string abc remember we

610
00:13:56,389 --> 00:13:56,399
make abc into a string abc remember we
 

611
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:02,310
make abc into a string abc remember we
talked about a method called join

612
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:02,320

 

613
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,470

yeah return we wanted to join by empty

614
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:06,480
yeah return we wanted to join by empty

dot join look join what
join us there okay so rainbow look every

620
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:12,880
join us there okay so rainbow look every
 

621
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,509
join us there okay so rainbow look every
look

622
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:13,519
look
 

623
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,509
look
all right so look

624
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:17,519
all right so look
 

625
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,430
all right so look
a b c this is a list if i

626
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:21,440
a b c this is a list if i
 

627
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,910
a b c this is a list if i
if i got space don't join then i'll

628
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:23,920
if i got space don't join then i'll
 

629
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,870
if i got space don't join then i'll
become a b c

630
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:24,880
become a b c
 

631
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,189
become a b c
yeah e okay

632
00:14:29,189 --> 00:14:29,199

 

633
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:35,690

what's the time complexity

we are using a data structure but we go

638
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:40,399
we are using a data structure but we go
 

639
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,910
we are using a data structure but we go
going through the string

640
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:41,920
going through the string
 

641
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,030
going through the string
once or twice or ten times

we are going through this a b c only

we are going through this a b c only
 

647
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,710
we are going through this a b c only

when are we finished

662
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:07,120
when are we finished
 

663
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,590
when are we finished
soon okay but now we don't need to we

664
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:09,600
soon okay but now we don't need to we
 

665
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,430
soon okay but now we don't need to we
don't need to

666
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:11,440
don't need to
 

667
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,910
don't need to
go back all right yeah yeah for all the

668
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:13,920
go back all right yeah yeah for all the
 

669
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,350
go back all right yeah yeah for all the
only time what's the space complexity

670
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:17,360
only time what's the space complexity
 

671
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,389
only time what's the space complexity
why is someone eating

672
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:20,399
why is someone eating
 

673
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,389
why is someone eating
using one yeah we're done because we're

674
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:22,399
using one yeah we're done because we're
 

675
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,230
using one yeah we're done because we're
using stack in the worst case

676
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:24,240
using stack in the worst case
 

677
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,230
using stack in the worst case
the stack will contain all the n

678
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:26,240
the stack will contain all the n
 

679
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,670
the stack will contain all the n
characters in the string

680
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:27,680
characters in the string
 

681
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,790
characters in the string
if they are non characters to be

682
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:30,800
if they are non characters to be
 

683
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,430
if they are non characters to be
uh next to each other the same right all

684
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:33,440
uh next to each other the same right all
 

685
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:33,829
uh next to each other the same right all
right

686
00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:33,839
right
 

687
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,030
right
so that's the worst cases uh

688
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:37,040
so that's the worst cases uh
 

689
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,749
so that's the worst cases uh
yeah that's it that's it for today [ __ ]

690
00:15:39,749 --> 00:15:39,759
yeah that's it that's it for today [ __ ]
 

691
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,350
yeah that's it that's it for today [ __ ]

no no no no no no night time no no no
that's it

696
