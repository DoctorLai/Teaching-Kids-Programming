00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,230

go hello hello mr mr ryan how are you

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:04,240
go hello hello mr mr ryan how are you
 

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,110
go hello hello mr mr ryan how are you
today

4
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:05,120
today
 

5
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,110
today
good day what have we talked about

6
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:07,120
good day what have we talked about
 

7
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,870
good day what have we talked about
yesterday remember

8
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:08,880
yesterday remember
 

9
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,709
yesterday remember
we taught about uh the

10
00:00:12,709 --> 00:00:12,719
we taught about uh the
 

11
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,110
we taught about uh the
lower the factorial oh yeah we talked

12
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:15,120
lower the factorial oh yeah we talked
 

13
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,870
lower the factorial oh yeah we talked
about the factorial thing

14
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:16,880
about the factorial thing
 

15
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,109
about the factorial thing
okay so can you remind me okay so what

16
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:19,119
okay so can you remind me okay so what
 

17
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,510
okay so can you remind me okay so what
is the factorial sum

18
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:21,520
is the factorial sum
 

19
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,390
is the factorial sum
one zero factorial equals one i one one

20
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:24,400
one zero factorial equals one i one one
 

21
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,910
one zero factorial equals one i one one
factorial

22
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:25,920
factorial
 

23
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,870
factorial
one factorial equal one two factorial

24
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:28,880
one factorial equal one two factorial
 

25
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:39,190
one factorial equal one two factorial
two

26
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:39,200

 

27
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,310

if i keep your number like 31 can you

28
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:42,320
if i keep your number like 31 can you
 

29
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,030
if i keep your number like 31 can you
tell me what

30
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:43,040
tell me what
 

31
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,029
tell me what
it's possible to use the issue possible

32
00:00:47,029 --> 00:00:47,039
it's possible to use the issue possible
 

33
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,510
it's possible to use the issue possible
what's this thing mean a unique unique

34
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:49,520
what's this thing mean a unique unique
 

35
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,189
what's this thing mean a unique unique
okay this thing unique uh

36
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:51,199
okay this thing unique uh
 

37
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:55,350
okay this thing unique uh
so for the 31 can we use this thing

38
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:55,360
so for the 31 can we use this thing
 

39
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,549
so for the 31 can we use this thing
yes and what are those uh

40
00:00:58,549 --> 00:00:58,559
yes and what are those uh
 

41
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,590
yes and what are those uh
uh one six twenty four

42
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:01,600
uh one six twenty four
 

43
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,469
uh one six twenty four
one plus six plus twenty five and how

44
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:04,479
one plus six plus twenty five and how
 

45
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:05,189
one plus six plus twenty five and how
how are we

46
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:05,199
how are we
 

47
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,870
how are we
what's our price okay so we just uh uh

48
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:08,880
what's our price okay so we just uh uh
 

49
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,390
what's our price okay so we just uh uh
uh replacing and so we are doing

50
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:12,400
uh replacing and so we are doing
 

51
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,230
uh replacing and so we are doing
we are showing the one yeah you like

52
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:14,240
we are showing the one yeah you like
 

53
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,749
we are showing the one yeah you like
that which which

54
00:01:15,749 --> 00:01:15,759
that which which
 

55
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,870
that which which
that 31 can subtract by

56
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:18,880
that 31 can subtract by
 

57
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,830
that 31 can subtract by
and then we are subtracting the biggest

58
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:21,840
and then we are subtracting the biggest
 

59
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,870
and then we are subtracting the biggest
as possible

60
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:22,880
as possible
 

61
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,789
as possible
so okay 31. 24. and then okay so

62
00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:26,799
so okay 31. 24. and then okay so
 

63
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,350
so okay 31. 24. and then okay so
we took minus 34 which would give us

64
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:29,360
we took minus 34 which would give us
 

65
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:29,830
we took minus 34 which would give us
seven

66
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:29,840
seven
 

67
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,270
seven
and then and minus six yeah six and then

68
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:33,280
and then and minus six yeah six and then
 

69
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,390
and then and minus six yeah six and then
one we have one okay yeah okay but not

70
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:36,400
one we have one okay yeah okay but not
 

71
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:36,950
one we have one okay yeah okay but not
not here

72
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:36,960
not here
 

73
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,510
not here
because there are two ones we just need

74
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:39,520
because there are two ones we just need
 

75
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,030
because there are two ones we just need
one okay

76
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,040
one okay
 

77
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,350
one okay
and so what's the term complexity of

78
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:45,360
and so what's the term complexity of
 

79
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,389
and so what's the term complexity of
this agreement

80
00:01:48,389 --> 00:01:48,399

 

81
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,630

let me try this one what's the term

82
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:50,640
let me try this one what's the term
 

83
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,910
let me try this one what's the term
complexity for this one

84
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:51,920
complexity for this one
 

85
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,109
complexity for this one
i don't think it's the you called it

86
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:57,119
i don't think it's the you called it
 

87
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,630
i don't think it's the you called it
and what's um your thing but

88
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:00,640
and what's um your thing but
 

89
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,670
and what's um your thing but
like this bit yes the number of

90
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:03,680
like this bit yes the number of
 

91
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,789
like this bit yes the number of
factorials

92
00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:04,799
factorials
 

93
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,429
factorials
that distinct factors that are smaller

94
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:07,439
that distinct factors that are smaller
 

95
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,229
that distinct factors that are smaller
or equal

96
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:08,239
or equal
 

97
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,350
or equal
than n right okay okay

98
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:11,360
than n right okay okay
 

99
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,710
than n right okay okay
so look if we if we have this

100
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:14,720
so look if we if we have this
 

101
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,350
so look if we if we have this
distinct in fisting the factorial number

102
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:17,360
distinct in fisting the factorial number
 

103
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,190
distinct in fisting the factorial number
saying okay this is the list of the

104
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:19,200
saying okay this is the list of the
 

105
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,190
saying okay this is the list of the
numbers we have 1 2 6 624 120

106
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:23,200
numbers we have 1 2 6 624 120
 

107
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,309
numbers we have 1 2 6 624 120
and 720 okay and

108
00:02:26,309 --> 00:02:26,319
and 720 okay and
 

109
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,790
and 720 okay and
we have uh we we know we are given the

110
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:28,800
we have uh we we know we are given the
 

111
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,190
we have uh we we know we are given the
number like

112
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:30,200
number like
 

113
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,869
number like
144. 144.

114
00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:32,879
144. 144.
 

115
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,070
144. 144.
so so literally this is

116
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:36,080
so so literally this is
 

117
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,110
so so literally this is
not like a knife problem okay so these

118
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:39,120
not like a knife problem okay so these
 

119
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,869
not like a knife problem okay so these
are the items these are the weight of

120
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:40,879
are the items these are the weight of
 

121
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:41,670
are the items these are the weight of
each item

122
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:41,680
each item
 

123
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,589
each item
and then yes one yeah i know i know

124
00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:45,599
and then yes one yeah i know i know
 

125
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,390
and then yes one yeah i know i know
but yeah too heavy yeah you are right

126
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:48,400
but yeah too heavy yeah you are right
 

127
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,949
but yeah too heavy yeah you are right
too heavy so this is the capacity of the

128
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:50,959
too heavy so this is the capacity of the
 

129
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:51,350
too heavy so this is the capacity of the
back

130
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:51,360
back
 

131
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,710
back
yeah and this is the item for each uh

132
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:54,720
yeah and this is the item for each uh
 

133
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,670
yeah and this is the item for each uh
this is the item the weight of the items

134
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:57,680
this is the item the weight of the items
 

135
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,309
this is the item the weight of the items
yeah so

136
00:02:58,309 --> 00:02:58,319
yeah so
 

137
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,790
yeah so
the the question becomes that can we

138
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:00,800
the the question becomes that can we
 

139
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,750
the the question becomes that can we
find

140
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:01,760
find
 

141
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,589
find
can we fill the bag the nutsack which

142
00:03:05,589 --> 00:03:05,599
can we fill the bag the nutsack which
 

143
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,869
can we fill the bag the nutsack which
we with some of the items yes

144
00:03:08,869 --> 00:03:08,879
we with some of the items yes
 

145
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,270
we with some of the items yes
and we want to exactly feel the bag

146
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:11,280
and we want to exactly feel the bag
 

147
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,949
and we want to exactly feel the bag
right okay

148
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:12,959
right okay
 

149
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,790
right okay
yeah so for for example

150
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:16,800
yeah so for for example
 

151
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,070
yeah so for for example
so if we list the uh items here eric

152
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:20,080
so if we list the uh items here eric
 

153
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,830
so if we list the uh items here eric
1 2 6 24 120

154
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:23,840
1 2 6 24 120
 

155
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,910
1 2 6 24 120
and then for each item how many choice

156
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:25,920
and then for each item how many choice
 

157
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,949
and then for each item how many choice
do we have

158
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:26,959
do we have
 

159
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,390
do we have
we have uh five

160
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:30,400
we have uh five
 

161
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,350
we have uh five
no no for example i want to this is item

162
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:33,360
no no for example i want to this is item
 

163
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,229
no no for example i want to this is item
one

164
00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:34,239
one
 

165
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,270
one
it is weight uh it's weight

166
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:37,280
it is weight uh it's weight
 

167
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,390
it is weight uh it's weight
one kilo for example and how many choice

168
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:40,400
one kilo for example and how many choice
 

169
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,030
one kilo for example and how many choice
can we put

170
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,040
can we put
 

171
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,390
can we put
can we have if we by deciding to put

172
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:44,400
can we have if we by deciding to put
 

173
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,949
can we have if we by deciding to put
into the nut step to what i lost either

174
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:46,959
into the nut step to what i lost either
 

175
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,110
into the nut step to what i lost either
take it or not pick it yeah pick it or

176
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:49,120
take it or not pick it yeah pick it or
 

177
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,030
take it or not pick it yeah pick it or
not pick it and then we can use this

178
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:51,040
not pick it and then we can use this
 

179
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,910
not pick it and then we can use this
strategy right to try each possibility

180
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:53,920
strategy right to try each possibility
 

181
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,630
strategy right to try each possibility
so for

182
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:54,640
so for
 

183
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,509
so for
for m items what's the time complexity

184
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:57,519
for m items what's the time complexity
 

185
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:05,640
for m items what's the time complexity
of this argument

186
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:05,650

 

187
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:38,390

[Music]

188
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:38,400

 

189
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,110

yeah so 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 this

190
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:41,120
yeah so 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 this
 

191
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,150
yeah so 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 this
is the multiplication

192
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:42,160
is the multiplication
 

193
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,469
is the multiplication
okay okay so let's let's run this step

194
00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:44,479
okay okay so let's let's run this step
 

195
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:45,350
okay okay so let's let's run this step
for search okay

196
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:45,360
for search okay
 

197
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:52,390
for search okay
let's play this strategy

198
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:52,400

 

199
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,230

look at my new tattoo okay enough enough

00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:03,440
uh let's say a
 

205
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,430
uh let's say a
distinct sum okay some bacteria let's

206
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:05,440
distinct sum okay some bacteria let's
 

207
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,469
distinct sum okay some bacteria let's
say bacteria

208
00:05:06,469 --> 00:05:06,479
say bacteria
 

209
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,670
say bacteria
factorial sum and then we are given this

210
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:09,680
factorial sum and then we are given this
 

211
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,150
factorial sum and then we are given this
end

212
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:10,160
end
 

213
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,110
end
now the first thing is to do what the

214
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:13,120
now the first thing is to do what the
 

215
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,749
now the first thing is to do what the
first thing

216

first thing
 

217
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,629
first thing
is to uh to what

218
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:18,639
is to uh to what
 

219
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,550
is to uh to what
we are given this number n so the first

220
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:20,560
we are given this number n so the first
 

221
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,749
we are given this number n so the first
thing we need

222
00:05:21,749 --> 00:05:21,759
thing we need
 

223
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,029
thing we need
to find the fact

00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:25,039
to find the fact
 

225
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,350
to find the fact
the fact the factorial let uh smaller

226
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:27,360
the fact the factorial let uh smaller
 

227
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,790
the fact the factorial let uh smaller
than or equal to n right

00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:28,800
than or equal to n right
 

229
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,909
than or equal to n right
and where we're going to put it in

230
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:31,919
and where we're going to put it in
 

231
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,270
and where we're going to put it in
fact and what's the fact

it's the thing we uh what's the fact
 

235
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,230
it's the thing we uh what's the fact
what's the what's the data structure we

236
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:40,240
what's the what's the data structure we
 

237
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,909
what's the what's the data structure we
are going to use to store the

238
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:41,919
are going to use to store the
 

239
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,350
are going to use to store the
number of bacteria i uh we

240
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:45,360
number of bacteria i uh we
 

241
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,469
number of bacteria i uh we
are going to put it in like

242
00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:48,479
are going to put it in like
 

243
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,510
are going to put it in like
a fact yeah what is that

244
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:51,520
a fact yeah what is that
 

245
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,309
a fact yeah what is that
what is this what is this a list a list

246
00:05:56,309 --> 00:05:56,319
what is this what is this a list a list
 

247
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,430
what is this what is this a list a list
yeah a list of numbers or we can use the

248
00:05:59,430 --> 00:05:59,440
yeah a list of numbers or we can use the
 

249
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,070
yeah a list of numbers or we can use the
including in the double ndq yeah dq we

250
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:02,080
including in the double ndq yeah dq we
 

251
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,990
including in the double ndq yeah dq we
can also put it in double nkq

252
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:04,000
can also put it in double nkq
 

253
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,909
can also put it in double nkq
okay so look factorial

254
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:07,919
okay so look factorial
 

255
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,150
okay so look factorial
equals let's put it in the dq yeah dq

256
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:12,160
equals let's put it in the dq yeah dq
 

257
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,189
equals let's put it in the dq yeah dq
dt double ended k double and cube we can

258
00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:15,199
dt double ended k double and cube we can
 

259
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:15,749
dt double ended k double and cube we can
put it in

260
00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:15,759
put it in
 

261
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,189
put it in
both sides okay if we put it on the left

262
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:19,199
both sides okay if we put it on the left
 

263
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,550
both sides okay if we put it on the left
then there'll be a descending order yeah

264
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:22,560
then there'll be a descending order yeah
 

265
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,350
then there'll be a descending order yeah
the biggest

266
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:23,360
the biggest
 

267
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,270
the biggest
factor will be on the beginning yeah if

268
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:25,280
factor will be on the beginning yeah if
 

269
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,710
factor will be on the beginning yeah if
we put it at the end

270
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:26,720
we put it at the end
 

271
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,749
we put it at the end
the biggest factor number will be at the

272
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:29,759
the biggest factor number will be at the
 

273
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,189
the biggest factor number will be at the
end right

274
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:31,199
end right
 

275
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,270
end right
okay x equals 1 why

276
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:35,280
okay x equals 1 why
 

277
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,390
okay x equals 1 why
why what uh let's say

278
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:38,400
why what uh let's say
 

279
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,670
why what uh let's say
let's do this uh k

280
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:41,680
let's do this uh k
 

281
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,189
let's do this uh k
okay k equals one y

282
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:45,199
okay k equals one y
 

283
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,589
okay k equals one y
k smaller equal n

284
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:49,599
k smaller equal n
 

285
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,550
k smaller equal n
what what do we do now y k smaller

286
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:52,560
what what do we do now y k smaller
 

287
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,430
what what do we do now y k smaller
equals n

288
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:53,440
equals n
 

289
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,029
equals n
what k times equals

290
00:06:57,029 --> 00:06:57,039
what k times equals
 

291
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,990
what k times equals
x and what should we do now with k k is

292
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,000
x and what should we do now with k k is
 

293
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:18,309
x and what should we do now with k k is
the factor

294
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:18,319

 

295
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,309

yeah let's put it in the left so the

296
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:20,319
yeah let's put it in the left so the
 

297
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,390
yeah let's put it in the left so the
left most the big the first one will be

298
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:22,400
left most the big the first one will be
 

299
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:22,710
left most the big the first one will be
the

300
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:22,720
the
 

301
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,070
the
largest factory apparent left

302
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,080
largest factory apparent left
 

303
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,589
largest factory apparent left
okay and now what should we do with the

304
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:27,599
okay and now what should we do with the
 

305
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,270
okay and now what should we do with the
x what should we do with the x

306
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:31,280
x what should we do with the x
 

307
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,790
x what should we do with the x
b what should we do one

308
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:34,800
b what should we do one
 

309
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,830
b what should we do one
yeah yes

310
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:37,840
yeah yes
 

311
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,629
yeah yes
x add equals one okay so now the

312
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:40,639
x add equals one okay so now the
 

313
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:41,909
x add equals one okay so now the
factorial will be the

314
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:41,919
factorial will be the
 

315
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,790
factorial will be the
list of the factors factories these are

316
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:44,800
list of the factors factories these are
 

317
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,629
list of the factors factories these are
factorial lesser smaller than n

318
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:46,639
factorial lesser smaller than n
 

319
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,790
factorial lesser smaller than n
right okay then now we do this dfs dfdfs

320
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:50,800
right okay then now we do this dfs dfdfs
 

321
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,309
right okay then now we do this dfs dfdfs
and then so what kind of parameters we

322
00:07:54,309 --> 00:07:54,319
and then so what kind of parameters we
 

323
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,270
and then so what kind of parameters we
do we have here

324
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:55,280
do we have here
 

325
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,070
do we have here
so the following for each item so if we

326
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:58,080
so the following for each item so if we
 

327
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,869
so the following for each item so if we
have this

328
00:07:58,869 --> 00:07:58,879
have this
 

329
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,350
have this
array bacteria this is the factorial

330
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:01,360
array bacteria this is the factorial
 

331
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,510
array bacteria this is the factorial
yeah

332
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:03,520
yeah
 

333
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,430
yeah
for example like like 144 right

334
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:07,440
for example like like 144 right
 

335
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,629
for example like like 144 right
that would be 1 2

336
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:10,639
that would be 1 2
 

337
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,710
that would be 1 2
6 24 120 yeah that's

338
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:14,720
6 24 120 yeah that's
 

339
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,589
6 24 120 yeah that's
it yeah effectively will be uh actually

340
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:17,599
it yeah effectively will be uh actually
 

341
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:18,070
it yeah effectively will be uh actually
you'll be

342
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:18,080
you'll be
 

343
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,909
you'll be
the opposite right because we append

344
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:19,919
the opposite right because we append
 

345
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,189
the opposite right because we append
left so you'll be

346
00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:21,199
left so you'll be
 

347
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,189
left so you'll be
you'll be what you'll be the opposite so

348
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:23,199
you'll be what you'll be the opposite so
 

349
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,830
you'll be what you'll be the opposite so
you'll be

350
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:24,840
you'll be
 

351
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,230
you'll be
120 24

352
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:28,240
120 24
 

353
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,830
120 24
6 2 we didn't need to change six

354
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:31,840
6 2 we didn't need to change six
 

355
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,709
6 2 we didn't need to change six
oh yeah yeah okay so

356
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:36,719

 

357
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,110

n equals 144 right so at the beginning

358
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:41,120
n equals 144 right so at the beginning
 

359
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,710
n equals 144 right so at the beginning
at the beginning so we need a index

360
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:44,720
at the beginning so we need a index
 

361
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,190
at the beginning so we need a index
to point out to which value we are using

362
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:47,200
to point out to which value we are using
 

363
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:47,990
to point out to which value we are using
right

364
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:48,000
right
 

365
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,990
right
okay so let's call it index index finger

366
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:52,000
okay so let's call it index index finger
 

367
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,670
okay so let's call it index index finger
and then the second parameter will be

368
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:55,680
and then the second parameter will be
 

369
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,829
and then the second parameter will be
n no no no the second parameter will be

370
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:57,839
n no no no the second parameter will be
 

371
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:58,870
n no no no the second parameter will be
n right

372
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:58,880
n right
 

373
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,190
n right
and right this is the number of the

374
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:01,200
and right this is the number of the
 

375
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,990
and right this is the number of the
capacity

376
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:02,000
capacity
 

377
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,350
capacity
left in the back i'm right yeah so when

378
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:05,360
left in the back i'm right yeah so when
 

379
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,310
left in the back i'm right yeah so when
it's reduced to zero what does it mean

380
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:08,320
it's reduced to zero what does it mean
 

381
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,949
it's reduced to zero what does it mean
uh it's true yeah it should means that

382
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:10,959
uh it's true yeah it should means that
 

383
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:11,910
uh it's true yeah it should means that
we have uh

384
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:11,920
we have uh
 

385
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,710
we have uh
we have found a way to fill the bag with

386
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:14,720
we have found a way to fill the bag with
 

387
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,389
we have found a way to fill the bag with
all right with items yeah

388
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:16,399
all right with items yeah
 

389
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,910
all right with items yeah
yeah so look if n equal

390
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:19,920
yeah so look if n equal
 

391
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,509
yeah so look if n equal
zero return one try

392
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:23,519
zero return one try
 

393
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,070
zero return one try
okay and then if n smaller than zero

394
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:26,080
okay and then if n smaller than zero
 

395
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,550
okay and then if n smaller than zero
what should we do

396
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:28,560
what should we do
 

397
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,910
what should we do
if it's smaller than zero what does it

398
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:29,920
if it's smaller than zero what does it
 

399
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,470
if it's smaller than zero what does it
mean return one

400
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:32,480
mean return one
 

401
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,509
mean return one
yeah because it's not possible yeah okay

402
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:35,519
yeah because it's not possible yeah okay
 

403
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,630
yeah because it's not possible yeah okay
and then

404
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:36,640
and then
 

405
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,750
and then
if index if index

406
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:39,760
if index if index
 

407
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,350
if index if index
equal bigger or equal equal length

408
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:43,360
equal bigger or equal equal length
 

409
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,110
equal bigger or equal equal length
length uh effect what does it mean

410
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:47,120
length uh effect what does it mean
 

411
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,350
length uh effect what does it mean
return one if the index here if it's run

412
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:51,360
return one if the index here if it's run
 

413
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,269
return one if the index here if it's run
out of index if it's indexed here what

414
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:53,279
out of index if it's indexed here what
 

415
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,470
out of index if it's indexed here what
does this mean

416
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:54,480
does this mean
 

417
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,550
does this mean
let's zero one two three four if it's

418
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:56,560
let's zero one two three four if it's
 

419
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,470
let's zero one two three four if it's
equal to five what does it mean

420
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:58,480
equal to five what does it mean
 

421
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,550
equal to five what does it mean
yeah because we have tried every

422
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:00,560
yeah because we have tried every
 

423
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,550
yeah because we have tried every
possibility i will try have each item

424
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:02,560
possibility i will try have each item
 

425
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,430
possibility i will try have each item
here

426
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:03,440
here
 

427
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,269
here
and then can you tell me what's what's

428
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:05,279
and then can you tell me what's what's
 

429
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,590
and then can you tell me what's what's
this return

430
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:07,600
this return
 

431
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,190
this return
return

432
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:11,200

 

433
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,310

so how many choice for this index

434
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:14,320
so how many choice for this index
 

435
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,509
so how many choice for this index
how many choice do we have 10 if n

436
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:17,519
how many choice do we have 10 if n
 

437
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,150
how many choice do we have 10 if n
equals zero no no no what what's the

438
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,160
equals zero no no no what what's the
 

439
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,710
equals zero no no no what what's the
energy or is that therefore such one

440
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:22,720
energy or is that therefore such one
 

441
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,790
energy or is that therefore such one
for the index current index i try the

442
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:24,800
for the index current index i try the
 

443
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,590
for the index current index i try the
next index try the next index right

444
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:27,600
next index try the next index right
 

445
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,630
next index try the next index right
so x plus one index plus one okay so

446
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:32,640
so x plus one index plus one okay so
 

447
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,550
so x plus one index plus one okay so
the next item i want to try is index

448
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:34,560
the next item i want to try is index
 

449
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,870
the next item i want to try is index
plus one and so for this item what can

450
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:36,880
plus one and so for this item what can
 

451
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,190
plus one and so for this item what can
we do with this

452
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:39,200
we do with this
 

453
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,030
we do with this
do we pick it or not pick it right we

454
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:41,040
do we pick it or not pick it right we
 

455
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,750
do we pick it or not pick it right we
can pick it or not pick it okay

456
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:43,760
can pick it or not pick it okay
 

457
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,910
can pick it or not pick it okay
for pick it what should we do with n if

458
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:45,920
for pick it what should we do with n if
 

459
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,310
for pick it what should we do with n if
we pick it what should we do we shall

460
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:48,320
we pick it what should we do we shall
 

461
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,430
we pick it what should we do we shall
subtract and subtract

462
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:51,440
subtract and subtract
 

463
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,430
subtract and subtract
index thing yeah so what factorial

464
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:55,440
index thing yeah so what factorial
 

465
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,509
index thing yeah so what factorial
index right and then what should i put o

466
00:10:59,509 --> 00:10:59,519
index right and then what should i put o
 

467
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,509
index right and then what should i put o
or n

468
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:01,519
or n
 

469
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,710
or n
what this is

470
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:04,720
what this is
 

471
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,630
what this is
yeah and the other one is not pick so

472
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:08,640
yeah and the other one is not pick so
 

473
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,150
yeah and the other one is not pick so
one of them is two is true or one person

474
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:12,160
one of them is two is true or one person
 

475
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,069
one of them is two is true or one person
is two are what's your opinion of

476
00:11:16,069 --> 00:11:16,079
is two are what's your opinion of
 

477
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:16,949
is two are what's your opinion of
lobbies i think

478
00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:16,959
lobbies i think
 

479
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,269
lobbies i think
you're doing something like oh oh yeah

480
00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:19,279
you're doing something like oh oh yeah
 

481
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,949
you're doing something like oh oh yeah
because yeah you can pick or not pick

482
00:11:20,949 --> 00:11:20,959
because yeah you can pick or not pick
 

483
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,750
because yeah you can pick or not pick
this right

484
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:21,760
this right
 

485
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,030
this right
so that's all oh what oh what i put it

486
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:25,040
so that's all oh what oh what i put it
 

487
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:32,069
so that's all oh what oh what i put it
here that's what such

488
00:11:32,069 --> 00:11:32,079

 

489
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,190

index plus one okay

490
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:35,200
index plus one okay
 

491
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,949
index plus one okay
and then no p if not p what happened

492
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:38,959
and then no p if not p what happened
 

493
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,550
and then no p if not p what happened
with this n

494
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:40,560
with this n
 

495
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,310
with this n
no no it's not pick what happened to

496
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:42,320
no no it's not pick what happened to
 

497
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,069
no no it's not pick what happened to
this end if i don't pick with this and

498
00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:44,079
this end if i don't pick with this and
 

499
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,509
this end if i don't pick with this and
how many items do

500
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:45,519
how many items do
 

501
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,030
how many items do
what's the weight left the weight

502
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:49,040
what's the weight left the weight
 

503
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,110
what's the weight left the weight
is it's worth it needs to be zero

504
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:53,120
is it's worth it needs to be zero
 

505
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,629
is it's worth it needs to be zero
no no no no colony is n if i

506
00:11:56,629 --> 00:11:56,639
no no no no colony is n if i
 

507
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,670
no no no no colony is n if i
pick one item let me subtract these

508
00:11:59,670 --> 00:11:59,680
pick one item let me subtract these
 

509
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,269
pick one item let me subtract these
if i don't pick these do i need to

510
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:01,279
if i don't pick these do i need to
 

511
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,350
if i don't pick these do i need to
subtract no so what's what's happened

512
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:03,360
subtract no so what's what's happened
 

513
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:03,829
subtract no so what's what's happened
here

514
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:03,839
here
 

515
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,509
here
n and it will be n right and then

516
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:07,519
n and it will be n right and then
 

517
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,550
n and it will be n right and then
and then i just need to return and

518
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:10,560
and then i just need to return and
 

519
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,350
and then i just need to return and
calling this one return dfs index will

520
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:13,360
calling this one return dfs index will
 

521
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,829
calling this one return dfs index will
be zero and then passing the

522
00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:15,839
be zero and then passing the
 

523
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,190
be zero and then passing the
n right pressing the n look yeah

524
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:19,200
n right pressing the n look yeah
 

525
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,310
n right pressing the n look yeah
okay so this is kick this is not p and

526
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:22,320
okay so this is kick this is not p and
 

527
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,470
okay so this is kick this is not p and
one of them is true

528
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:24,480
one of them is true
 

529
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,389
one of them is true
it means that we found a way right i'm

530
00:12:26,389 --> 00:12:26,399
it means that we found a way right i'm
 

531
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,949
it means that we found a way right i'm
right yeah

get a value yeah and then
 

579
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:58,150
get a value yeah and then
index index one

that return again
 

591
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,829
that return again
return these this is to pick and then

592
00:14:17,829 --> 00:14:17,839
return these this is to pick and then
 

593
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,750
return these this is to pick and then
what's the other option

594
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:19,760
what's the other option
 

595
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,870
what's the other option
uh you can not pick right yeah

596
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:22,880
uh you can not pick right yeah
 

597
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,949
uh you can not pick right yeah
so oh yeah

598
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:26,959

 

599
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,550

yeah zero end

00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:30,560
yeah zero end
 

601
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,629
yeah zero end
he's not finished here index plus one

602
00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:34,639
he's not finished here index plus one
 

603
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,990
he's not finished here index plus one
and then and that's it yeah

604
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:38,000
and then and that's it yeah
 

605
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,069
and then and that's it yeah
and then we are calling with p as what

606
00:14:40,069 --> 00:14:40,079
and then we are calling with p as what
 

607
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,110
and then we are calling with p as what
what's the value of

608
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:41,120
what's the value of
 

609
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,750
what's the value of
index at the beginning what's the thing

610
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:43,760
index at the beginning what's the thing
 

611
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,550
index at the beginning what's the thing
there

612
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:44,560
there
 

613
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,389
there
0 0 and what's the value of n

614
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:48,399
0 0 and what's the value of n
 

615
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,750
0 0 and what's the value of n
what's the value of n the value of

616
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:51,760
what's the value of n the value of
 

617
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,990
what's the value of n the value of
n is the sum

618
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:56,000
n is the sum
 

619
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,629
n is the sum
it's the it's on it's n y it's the same

620
00:14:58,629 --> 00:14:58,639
it's the it's on it's n y it's the same
 

621
00:14:58,639 --> 00:14:59,670
it's the it's on it's n y it's the same
yeah passing the s

622
00:14:59,670 --> 00:14:59,680
yeah passing the s
 

623
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,870
yeah passing the s
right n

624
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:02,880
right n
 

625
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,590
right n
yeah yeah this is this n that's so

626
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:05,600
yeah yeah this is this n that's so
 

627
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,310
yeah yeah this is this n that's so
obvious

628
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:06,320
obvious
 

629
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,150
obvious
yeah that's not so obvious yeah because

630
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:08,160
yeah that's not so obvious yeah because
 

631
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,069
yeah that's not so obvious yeah because
we we are we want to find out if

632
00:15:10,069 --> 00:15:10,079
we we are we want to find out if
 

633
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,470
we we are we want to find out if
we can sum up to n right and that's the

634
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:12,480
we can sum up to n right and that's the
 

635
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,470
we can sum up to n right and that's the
that's the weight of the knapsack right

636
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:14,480
that's the weight of the knapsack right
 

637
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,790
that's the weight of the knapsack right
that's the maximum capacity of nam sec

638
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:16,800
that's the maximum capacity of nam sec
 

639
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,069
that's the maximum capacity of nam sec
okay okay that's it for today

640
00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:20,079
okay okay that's it for today
 

641
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,350
okay okay that's it for today
so lastly which one is more uh

642
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:23,360
so lastly which one is more uh
 

643
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,829
so lastly which one is more uh
efficient the one we talked about today

644
00:15:25,829 --> 00:15:25,839
efficient the one we talked about today
 

645
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:26,629
efficient the one we talked about today
or the one

646
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:26,639
or the one
 

647
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,069
or the one
we talked about yesterday using that

648
00:15:30,069 --> 00:15:30,079
we talked about yesterday using that
 

649
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:31,990
we talked about yesterday using that
using the try the maximum thing which

650
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:32,000
using the try the maximum thing which
 

651
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,509
using the try the maximum thing which
one what happened

652
00:15:33,509 --> 00:15:33,519
one what happened
 

653
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,550
one what happened
yesterday the complexities work and

654
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:36,560
yesterday the complexities work and
 

655
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,790
yesterday the complexities work and
today's complexity is over

656
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:40,800
today's complexity is over
 

657
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,870
today's complexity is over
come on we've talked about this before

658
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:42,880
come on we've talked about this before
 

659
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,430
come on we've talked about this before
each one has two options

660
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:45,440
each one has two options
 

661
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,430
each one has two options
yeah two to the power

662
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:49,440
yeah two to the power
 

663
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,949
yeah two to the power
okay so which one is better this one

664
00:15:52,949 --> 00:15:52,959
okay so which one is better this one
 

665
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,470
okay so which one is better this one
yeah of course this one is far better

666
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:54,480
yeah of course this one is far better
 

667
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,949
yeah of course this one is far better
than this one yeah look om is the

668
00:15:56,949 --> 00:15:56,959
than this one yeah look om is the
 

669
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,430
than this one yeah look om is the
omg here and what's out to the power of

670
00:15:59,430 --> 00:15:59,440
omg here and what's out to the power of
 

671
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,509
omg here and what's out to the power of
n

672
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:03,519

 

673
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,030

2 to the power of 0 is what 1

674
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:07,040
2 to the power of 0 is what 1
 

675
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,710
2 to the power of 0 is what 1
2 to the power of 1 is 2 so it will be

676
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:10,720
2 to the power of 1 is 2 so it will be
 

677
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,910
2 to the power of 1 is 2 so it will be
like that okay so this is m this is the

678
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:13,920
like that okay so this is m this is the
 

679
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,030
like that okay so this is m this is the
complexity o

680
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:15,040
complexity o
 

681
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,389
complexity o
m okay o o m

682
00:16:18,389 --> 00:16:18,399
m okay o o m
 

683
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,430
m okay o o m
is this this line okay om

684
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:21,440
is this this line okay om
 

685
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,550
is this this line okay om
and o to m is this listener so one m is

686
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:24,560
and o to m is this listener so one m is
 

687
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,069
and o to m is this listener so one m is
a hundred

688
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:26,079
a hundred
 

689
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,550
a hundred
yeah m is hundred oh o two to the power

690
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:28,560
yeah m is hundred oh o two to the power
 

691
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,150
yeah m is hundred oh o two to the power
of hundred that's a very big number

692
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:30,160
of hundred that's a very big number
 

693
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:30,790
of hundred that's a very big number
right

694
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:30,800
right
 

695
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,430
right
got it yeah you see so in this case we

696
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:33,440
got it yeah you see so in this case we
 

697
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,030
got it yeah you see so in this case we
can see

698
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:35,040
can see
 

699
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,030
can see
yesterday's approach is far better than

700
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:37,040
yesterday's approach is far better than
 

701
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,790
yesterday's approach is far better than
this one today we're using a recursion

702
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:38,800
this one today we're using a recursion
 

703
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,550
this one today we're using a recursion
definition why is the recursion

704
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:40,560
definition why is the recursion
 

705
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,030
definition why is the recursion
happening

706
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:41,040
happening
 

707
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,550
happening
yeah can you tell me recursion happening

708
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:44,560
yeah can you tell me recursion happening
 

709
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,829
yeah can you tell me recursion happening
what's great recursion recursion is like

710
00:16:48,829 --> 00:16:48,839
what's great recursion recursion is like
 

711
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,829
what's great recursion recursion is like
uh what's the recursion come on

712
00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:51,839
uh what's the recursion come on
 

713
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,069
uh what's the recursion come on
we talked about it first day okay so

714
00:16:54,069 --> 00:16:54,079
we talked about it first day okay so
 

715
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,269
we talked about it first day okay so
recursion is like a thing that is

716
00:16:57,269 --> 00:16:57,279
recursion is like a thing that is
 

717
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,710
recursion is like a thing that is
uh how can i explain what
