the remaining is the pending

what did it look like before before it
 

155
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,830
what did it look like before before it
was just any

156
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:07,840
was just any
 

157
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,030
was just any
sometimes kind of you know you see i put

158
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:11,040
sometimes kind of you know you see i put
 

159
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,830
sometimes kind of you know you see i put
any letters

160
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:11,840
any letters
 

161
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,789
any letters
in between right so so just to mess it

162
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:14,799
in between right so so just to mess it
 

163
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,550
in between right so so just to mess it
up but you need to tell me this is the

164
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:16,560
up but you need to tell me this is the
 

165
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,909
up but you need to tell me this is the
noisy

166
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:17,919

169
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,270

why is noise because we only consider

00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:23,280
why is noise because we only consider
 

171
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,150
why is noise because we only consider
the lower case

172
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:24,160
the lower case

does it make sense can you tell me how
 

177
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,070
does it make sense can you tell me how
to do it

178

just
can you tell me how do you do it

198
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:53,840
can you tell me how do you do it
 

199
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,710
can you tell me how do you do it
we can construct a copy right yeah so

200
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:56,720
we can construct a copy right yeah so
 

201
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,110
we can construct a copy right yeah so
you tell me okay let's say

202
00:04:59,110 --> 00:04:59,120
you tell me okay let's say
 

203
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,830
you tell me okay let's say
all right let's say the new string okay

204
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:01,840
all right let's say the new string okay
 

205
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,189
all right let's say the new string okay
new string

206
00:05:03,189 --> 00:05:03,199
new string
 

207
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,629
new string
equals nothing right and then for

208
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:06,639
equals nothing right and then for
 

209
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,950
equals nothing right and then for
i in s if

210
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:10,960
i in s if
 

211
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,270
i in s if
if i is not a lowercase how do you check

212
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:15,280
if i is not a lowercase how do you check
 

213
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,070
if i is not a lowercase how do you check
if it's a

214
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:16,080
if it's a
 

215
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,950
if it's a
if if the character is clear lowercase

216
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:18,960
if if the character is clear lowercase
 

217
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,189
if if the character is clear lowercase
or no lowercase

218
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:21,199
or no lowercase
 

219
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,790
or no lowercase
how do we check if a character so if lee

220
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:24,800
how do we check if a character so if lee
 

221
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,790
how do we check if a character so if lee
c is a character and how do we cherry

222
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:26,800
c is a character and how do we cherry
 

223
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,749
c is a character and how do we cherry
with the

224
00:05:27,749 --> 00:05:27,759
with the
 

225
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,070
with the
lowercase

226
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,080

 

227
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,189

all you can do is look because lowercase

228
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:35,199
all you can do is look because lowercase
 

229
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,990
all you can do is look because lowercase
remember this ascii is continuous right

230
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:38,000
remember this ascii is continuous right
 

231
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,350
remember this ascii is continuous right
from a to z right

232
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:39,360
from a to z right
 

233
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,029
from a to z right
so you can do this smaller equals

234
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:43,039
so you can do this smaller equals
 

235
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,310
so you can do this smaller equals
z bigger equals

236
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:46,320
z bigger equals
 

237
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,350
z bigger equals
a doesn't make sense yeah so c is

238
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:49,360
a doesn't make sense yeah so c is
 

239
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:49,990
a doesn't make sense yeah so c is
between a

240
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:50,000
between a
 

241
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,390
between a
and z so it's a lot right does that make

242
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:52,400
and z so it's a lot right does that make
 

243
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,029
and z so it's a lot right does that make
sense

244
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:53,039
sense
 

245
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,469
sense
yeah yeah can we do it can we do it this

246
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:56,479
yeah yeah can we do it can we do it this
 

247
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:57,749
yeah yeah can we do it can we do it this
way right

248
00:05:57,749 --> 00:05:57,759
way right
 

249
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,950
way right
yeah oh this array

250
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:00,960
yeah oh this array
 

251
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,430
yeah oh this array
please it's the same as what eventually

252
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:03,440
please it's the same as what eventually
 

253
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,950
please it's the same as what eventually
c top

254
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:04,960
c top
 

255
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,150
c top
is lower that's

256
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,160
is lower that's
 

257
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,189
is lower that's
it doesn't make sense so this

258
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:11,199
it doesn't make sense so this
 

259
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,950
it doesn't make sense so this
will return true if it's a lowercase

260
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:12,960
will return true if it's a lowercase
 

261
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,309
will return true if it's a lowercase
yeah

262
00:06:14,309 --> 00:06:14,319
yeah
 

263
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,749
yeah
and how about look c dot is upper

264
00:06:17,749 --> 00:06:17,759
and how about look c dot is upper
 

265
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:33,189
and how about look c dot is upper
yeah then let's

266
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:33,199

 

267
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,710

and also this is digit make it yeah

268
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:36,720
and also this is digit make it yeah
 

269
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,029
and also this is digit make it yeah
so your digit is the same as what can

270
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:39,039
so your digit is the same as what can
 

271
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,230
so your digit is the same as what can
you tell me is digit

272
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:40,240
you tell me is digit
 

273
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,230
you tell me is digit
is equal to one it's digit equals

274
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:44,240
is equal to one it's digit equals
 

275
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,070
is equal to one it's digit equals
okay what doesn't that mean what's in

276
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:46,080
okay what doesn't that mean what's in
 

277
00:06:46,080 --> 00:07:01,189
okay what doesn't that mean what's in
there

278
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:01,199

 

279
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,230

ascii 48 is asking yeah

280
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:04,240
ascii 48 is asking yeah
 

281
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,670
ascii 48 is asking yeah
asking this one how many a couple of a

282
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:07,680
asking this one how many a couple of a
 

283
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,270
asking this one how many a couple of a
uh who is 48

284
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:11,280
uh who is 48
 

285
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:23,589
uh who is 48
50 65

286
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:23,599

 

287
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,950

if i is is lower

288
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:26,960
if i is is lower
 

289
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,790
if i is is lower
so what should we put it here if i is

290
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:28,800
so what should we put it here if i is
 

291
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,070
so what should we put it here if i is
lower ns

292
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:34,080

 

293
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,270

bigger look ns is the new string we want

294
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:37,280
bigger look ns is the new string we want
 

295
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,629
bigger look ns is the new string we want
to

296
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:38,639
to
 

297
00:07:38,639 --> 00:08:13,270
to
make it only add

298
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:13,280

 

299
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,629

what does it mean you want

300
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:16,639
what does it mean you want
 

301
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,670
what does it mean you want
now ns contains the characters not

302
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:19,680
now ns contains the characters not
 

303
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,589
now ns contains the characters not
only the lower case so we want to check

304
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:21,599
only the lower case so we want to check
 

305
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,909
only the lower case so we want to check
ns if it's a pending term right

306
00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:23,919
ns if it's a pending term right
 

307
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,309
ns if it's a pending term right
so you just grade word at the beginning

308
00:08:26,309 --> 00:08:26,319
so you just grade word at the beginning
 

309
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,309
so you just grade word at the beginning
okay

310
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:28,319
okay
 

311
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:35,430
okay
so it's return yeah return

312
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:35,440

 

313
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,630

okay and then what and i said

314
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:38,640
okay and then what and i said
 

315
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,230
okay and then what and i said
how do you check an assistant location

316
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:42,240
how do you check an assistant location
 

317
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:42,709
how do you check an assistant location
yeah

318
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:42,719
yeah
 

319
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,910
yeah
yeah okay okay man

320
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:47,920

 

321
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,350

wait yeah

322
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:51,360

 

323
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:57,990

that's it what's the term complexity

324
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:58,000

 

325
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,990

what's the term complexity

326
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:02,000

 

327
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,430

yeah you can say well what's your

328
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:03,440
yeah you can say well what's your
 

329
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,590
yeah you can say well what's your
special capacity

330
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:05,600
special capacity
 

331
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,030
special capacity
what's a space compression can you

332
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:07,040
what's a space compression can you
 

333
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,269
what's a space compression can you
listen to that

334
00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:09,279
listen to that
 

335
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,370
listen to that
what's the space complexity

336
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:11,380
what's the space complexity
 

337
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:17,509
what's the space complexity
[Music]

338
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:17,519

 

339
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,070

as i said the string is very slow right

340
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:20,080
as i said the string is very slow right
 

341
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,630
as i said the string is very slow right
you just keep adding it so it's better

342
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:22,640
you just keep adding it so it's better
 

343
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,150
you just keep adding it so it's better
to do it

344
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:24,160
to do it
 

345
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,389
to do it
look leave it yeah you can do this a pen

346
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:28,399
look leave it yeah you can do this a pen
 

347
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,509
look leave it yeah you can do this a pen
yeah

348
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:29,519
yeah
 

349
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,790
yeah
open yeah okay i and ns is the list

350
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:32,800
open yeah okay i and ns is the list
 

351
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,030
open yeah okay i and ns is the list
now then you can you can do what you

352
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,040
now then you can you can do what you
 

353
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,470
now then you can you can do what you
want to check is that

354
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:36,480
want to check is that
 

355
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,310
want to check is that
you can also compare with the list with

356
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:38,320
you can also compare with the list with
 

357
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,829
you can also compare with the list with
this so it still works okay

358
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:39,839
this so it still works okay
 

359
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,790
this so it still works okay
so it's better to use the list okay so

360
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:44,800
so it's better to use the list okay so
 

361
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,070
so it's better to use the list okay so
how about we uh using the

362
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:48,080
how about we uh using the
 

363
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,870
how about we uh using the
how about array how about however we can

364
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:50,880
how about array how about however we can
 

365
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,990
how about array how about however we can
we can

366
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:52,000
we can
 

367
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,350
we can
what we can do we can use the two

368
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:53,360
what we can do we can use the two
 

369
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,670
what we can do we can use the two
pointer and skip the

370
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:55,680
pointer and skip the
 

371
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,790
pointer and skip the
skip to next lowercase right

372
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:58,800
skip to next lowercase right
 

373
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,470
skip to next lowercase right
hey oh

374

j equals zero m minus one right

388
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:21,120
j equals zero m minus one right
 

389
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,190
j equals zero m minus one right
left and right yeah less than right wire

390
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:25,200
left and right yeah less than right wire
 

391
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,710
left and right yeah less than right wire
i smaller than j if two pointers not

392
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:28,720
i smaller than j if two pointers not
 

393
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,509
i smaller than j if two pointers not
meeting each other right lamba we need

394
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:31,519
meeting each other right lamba we need
 

395
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:32,550

please what we want to speak the long

400
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:37,519
please what we want to speak the long
 

401
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,949
please what we want to speak the long
none lowercase so how can we do this

402
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:40,959
none lowercase so how can we do this
 

403
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,829
none lowercase so how can we do this
while i are smaller than j again right

404
00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:44,839
while i are smaller than j again right
 

405
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,990
while i are smaller than j again right
and if not

406
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:48,000
and if not
 

407
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,030
and if not
what s i dot

408
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,040
what s i dot
 

409
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,470
what s i dot
is lower right does it make sense

410
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:54,480
is lower right does it make sense
 

411
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,949
is lower right does it make sense
then i plus equals one doesn't make

412
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:56,959
then i plus equals one doesn't make
 

413
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,230
then i plus equals one doesn't make
sense so when

414
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:00,240
sense so when
 

415
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,350

435
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,870

when i skip it look why i smaller than j

436
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:38,880
when i skip it look why i smaller than j
 

437
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,550
when i skip it look why i smaller than j
right i is here right

438
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:40,560
right i is here right
 

439
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,110
right i is here right
j is here and s i is lower is it lower

440
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:45,120
j is here and s i is lower is it lower
 

441
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,470
j is here and s i is lower is it lower
no right not little become true right

442
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:48,480
no right not little become true right
 

443
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,190
no right not little become true right
this is not lower right and i smaller

444
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:51,200
this is not lower right and i smaller
 

445
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:51,590
this is not lower right and i smaller
than j

446
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:51,600
than j
 

447
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,990
than j
i keep moving i plus one right yeah it's

448
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:54,000
i keep moving i plus one right yeah it's
 

449
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,870
i keep moving i plus one right yeah it's
still not

450
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:54,880
still not
 

451
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,670
still not
lower case right i move it so i will be

452
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:57,680
lower case right i move it so i will be
 

453
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,870
lower case right i move it so i will be
here

454
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:58,880
here
 

455
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,069
here
right then i plus 1 and then the same as

456
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:02,079
right then i plus 1 and then the same as
 

457
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,670
right then i plus 1 and then the same as
y is more than j and

458
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:05,680
y is more than j and
 

459
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:11,190
y is more than j and
not s j dot is lower right

460
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:11,200
not s j dot is lower right
 

461
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,629
not s j dot is lower right
then how what should i do here 31 minus

462
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:14,639
then how what should i do here 31 minus
 

463
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,829
then how what should i do here 31 minus
equal to 1 3 you'll come here right

464
00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:17,839
equal to 1 3 you'll come here right
 

465
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,870
equal to 1 3 you'll come here right
right over here and i look then what

466
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:20,880
right over here and i look then what
 

467
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,430
right over here and i look then what
should we do

468
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:21,440
should we do
 

469
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:28,550
should we do
if s i not equal as sj what should we do

470
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:28,560

 

471
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,110

above okay and then i i need to

472
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:33,120
above okay and then i i need to
 

473
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,509
above okay and then i i need to
what i need to i plus equal one and then

474
00:12:35,509 --> 00:12:35,519
what i need to i plus equal one and then
 

475
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:50,310
what i need to i plus equal one and then
one

476
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:50,320

 

477
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,030

so does it make sense yeah this is look

478
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:53,040
so does it make sense yeah this is look
 

479
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,230
so does it make sense yeah this is look
do you know all right

480
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:56,240

 

481
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,629

why is it noisy the only only special

482
00:12:58,629 --> 00:12:58,639
why is it noisy the only only special
 

483
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,150
why is it noisy the only only special
part here is these two pins

484
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:00,160
part here is these two pins
 

485
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,230
part here is these two pins
right yeah if you take away these two

486
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:04,240
right yeah if you take away these two
 

487
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,190
right yeah if you take away these two
white loop is the same of checking if

488
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:07,200
white loop is the same of checking if
 

489
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,430
white loop is the same of checking if
the string is charged am i right

490
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:09,440
the string is charged am i right
 

491
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,750
the string is charged am i right
yeah because previously we have we know

492
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:11,760
yeah because previously we have we know
 

493
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,470
yeah because previously we have we know
that

494
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:12,480
that
 

495
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,629
that
if we if we without this bit that would

496
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:14,639
if we if we without this bit that would
 

497
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,550
if we if we without this bit that would
be the standard

498
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:16,560
be the standard
 

499
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,350
be the standard
equals one yeah yeah that would be if we

500
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:19,360
equals one yeah yeah that would be if we
 

501
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:19,990
equals one yeah yeah that would be if we
don't have this

502
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:20,000
don't have this
 

503
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,509
don't have this
part that will be checking if the

504
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:21,519
part that will be checking if the
 

505
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,110
part that will be checking if the
strings are present right

506
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:23,120
strings are present right
 

507
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,269
strings are present right
but now we need to add these because we

508
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:25,279
but now we need to add these because we
 

509
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,870
but now we need to add these because we
want to skip

510
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:26,880
want to skip
 

511
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,509
want to skip
non-lowercase characters right yeah we

512
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:29,519
non-lowercase characters right yeah we
 

513
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,389
non-lowercase characters right yeah we
don't want to speak

514
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:30,399
don't want to speak
 

515
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,990
don't want to speak
skip uppercase the of marker the

516
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:34,000
skip uppercase the of marker the
 

517
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,110
skip uppercase the of marker the
question mark

518
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:35,120
question mark
 

519
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,110
question mark
whatever integers right other than the

520
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:37,120
whatever integers right other than the
 

521
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,150
whatever integers right other than the
numbers yeah

522
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,160
numbers yeah
 

523
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,470
numbers yeah
okay so let's let's leave speed what's

524
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:40,480
okay so let's let's leave speed what's
 

525
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,189
okay so let's let's leave speed what's
the time complexity

526
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:43,199
the time complexity
 

527
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,550
the time complexity
what's a space compression a1 oh one

528
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:46,560
what's a space compression a1 oh one
 

529
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,069
what's a space compression a1 oh one
come on we're not using any space

530
00:13:48,069 --> 00:13:48,079
come on we're not using any space
 

531
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:52,310
come on we're not using any space
right yeah i like i went yeah

532
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:52,320
right yeah i like i went yeah
 

533
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,790
right yeah i like i went yeah
okay okay can we come look at this is

534
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:54,800
okay okay can we come look at this is
 

535
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,350
okay okay can we come look at this is
this

536
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:55,360
this
 

537
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,829
this
this this is actually how we doing it

538
00:13:57,829 --> 00:13:57,839
this this is actually how we doing it
 

539
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,350
this this is actually how we doing it
you need to understand how we're doing

540
00:13:59,350 --> 00:13:59,360
you need to understand how we're doing
 

541
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,269
you need to understand how we're doing
but in python we can use the

542
00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:01,279
but in python we can use the
 

543
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,069
but in python we can use the
simple syntax yeah i show you a couple

544
00:14:04,069 --> 00:14:04,079
simple syntax yeah i show you a couple
 

545
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,990
simple syntax yeah i show you a couple
of functions to use in the

546
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:08,000

 

547
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,829

syntax all right look look alright look

548
00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:11,839
syntax all right look look alright look
 

549
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,030
syntax all right look look alright look
a equal let's see at

550
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:15,040
a equal let's see at
 

551
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,030
a equal let's see at
out let's filter out the the the

552
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:19,040
out let's filter out the the the
 

553
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,910
out let's filter out the the the
long lowercase characters eric look you

554
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:21,920
long lowercase characters eric look you
 

555
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,150
long lowercase characters eric look you
can do this

556
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:24,160
can do this
 

557
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,269
can do this
c alright look for

558
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:27,279
c alright look for
 

559
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,629
c alright look for
c in s in s

560
00:14:30,629 --> 00:14:30,639
c in s in s
 

561
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,670
c in s in s
and can you tell me what's right if what

562
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:33,680
and can you tell me what's right if what
 

563
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,710
and can you tell me what's right if what
if what c for c in

564
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:36,720
if what c for c in
 

565
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,580
if what c for c in
s is what c

566
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:38,590
s is what c
 

567
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:42,550

[Music]

568
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:42,560

 

569
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,790

we want to keep the lowercase okay yeah

570
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:44,800
we want to keep the lowercase okay yeah
 

571
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,269
we want to keep the lowercase okay yeah
it's lower right

572
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:47,279
it's lower right
 

573
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,269
it's lower right
yeah and then and then you can just do

574
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:49,279
yeah and then and then you can just do
 

575
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,389
yeah and then and then you can just do
this return

576
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:50,399
this return
 

577
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,509
this return
a

578

579
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,629

yeah you see less easier yeah

580
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:56,639
yeah you see less easier yeah
 

581
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,509
yeah you see less easier yeah
or you can do is the what the y i is

582
00:14:59,509 --> 00:14:59,519
or you can do is the what the y i is
 

583
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:00,310
or you can do is the what the y i is
smaller than j

584
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:00,320
smaller than j
 

585
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,230
smaller than j
thing it depends on how you like yeah

00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:02,240
thing it depends on how you like yeah
 

587
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,829
thing it depends on how you like yeah
yeah right okay

yeah yeah we're done look and look
 

591
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,870
yeah yeah we're done look and look
okay suppose we speed you can do this

eric this is a list yeah you can
 

595
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,230
eric this is a list yeah you can
do it as a generator and you put a list

596
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:14,240
do it as a generator and you put a list
 

597
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,030
do it as a generator and you put a list
here right

is the same yeah oh you can do this
 

609
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,470
is the same yeah oh you can do this
let's

610
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:26,480
let's
 

611
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,749
let's
you can do this already a

612
00:15:29,749 --> 00:15:29,759
you can do this already a
 

613
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,509
you can do this already a
equals what

614
00:15:33,509 --> 00:15:33,519
equals what
 

615
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,949
equals what
this i know we use the theater function

616
00:15:36,949 --> 00:15:36,959
this i know we use the theater function
 

617
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,350
this i know we use the theater function
theater

618
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:41,360

 

619
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,670

what's theatre remember to filter out

620
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:43,680
what's theatre remember to filter out
 

621
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,430
what's theatre remember to filter out
something a theater language

622
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:45,440
something a theater language
 

623
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,910
something a theater language
function we can call it lambda i order f

624
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:47,920
function we can call it lambda i order f
 

625
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,710
function we can call it lambda i order f
first

626
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:48,720
first
 

627
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,749
first
and then s and what's f oh uh

628
00:15:51,749 --> 00:15:51,759
and then s and what's f oh uh
 

629
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,110
and then s and what's f oh uh
let's call it g you can do it define

630
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:55,120
let's call it g you can do it define
 

631
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,350
let's call it g you can do it define
g c return

632
00:15:59,350 --> 00:15:59,360
g c return
 

633
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,470
g c return
c dot is lower right that will be easier

634
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:02,480
c dot is lower right that will be easier
 

635
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,430
c dot is lower right that will be easier
and all you

636
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:03,440
and all you
 

637
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,030
and all you
you you move this you change this g to

638
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:07,040
you you move this you change this g to
 

639
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,790
you you move this you change this g to
lambda lambda

640
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:10,800
lambda lambda
 

641
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,629
lambda lambda
g g dot is lower

642
00:16:14,629 --> 00:16:14,639
g g dot is lower
 

643
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,509
g g dot is lower
and then you gotta add return a and

644
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:17,519
and then you gotta add return a and
 

645
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,590
and then you gotta add return a and
return this is the same way return

646
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:19,600
return this is the same way return
 

647
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,910
return this is the same way return
a minus minus one equals equals a y

648
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:23,920
a minus minus one equals equals a y
 

649
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,749
a minus minus one equals equals a y
okay so this list using the field

650
00:16:25,749 --> 00:16:25,759
okay so this list using the field
 

651
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,269
okay so this list using the field
function the fact remember we talked

652
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:27,279
function the fact remember we talked
 

653
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,949
function the fact remember we talked
about this a few days ago the field of

654
00:16:28,949 --> 00:16:28,959
about this a few days ago the field of
 

655
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:29,430
about this a few days ago the field of
function

656
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:29,440
function
 

657
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,230
function
the function you can define it as a

658
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:32,240
the function you can define it as a
 

659
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,150
the function you can define it as a
separate function or a lambda function

660
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:34,160
separate function or a lambda function
 

661
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,550
separate function or a lambda function
you will go through the list go to the

662
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:36,560
you will go through the list go to the
 

663
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,790
you will go through the list go to the
string or list in the second parameter

664
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:38,800
string or list in the second parameter
 

665
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,189
string or list in the second parameter
and then check only only return

666
00:16:43,189 --> 00:16:43,199
and then check only only return
 

667
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,030
and then check only only return
when the function return true right so

668
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:45,040
when the function return true right so
 

669
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,870
when the function return true right so
in this case it's the lowercase

670
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:46,880
in this case it's the lowercase
 

671
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,430
in this case it's the lowercase
right so your filter the string in s

672
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:49,440
right so your filter the string in s
 

673
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,069
right so your filter the string in s
characteristics and only keep

674
00:16:52,069 --> 00:16:52,079
characteristics and only keep
 

675
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,310
characteristics and only keep
the lowercase right does it make sense

676
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:54,320
the lowercase right does it make sense
 

677
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,150
the lowercase right does it make sense
yeah

678
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:56,160
yeah
 

679
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,990
yeah
oh we also can do one okay

680
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:00,000
oh we also can do one okay
 

681
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,030
oh we also can do one okay
or we can do this s0

682
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:03,040
or we can do this s0
 

683
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,390
or we can do this s0
equals look yeah

684
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:06,400
equals look yeah
 

685
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,429
equals look yeah
c for c in

686
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:09,439
c for c in
 

687
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,429

in s if c dot is lower right this is 5

688
00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:13,439
in s if c dot is lower right this is 5
 

689
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,110
in s if c dot is lower right this is 5
you know right yeah and then s1

690
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:17,120
you know right yeah and then s1
 

691
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,309
you know right yeah and then s1
equals c for c

692
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:20,319
equals c for c
 

693
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,909
equals c for c
in reverse

694
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:23,919
in reverse
 

695
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,350
in reverse
reversed s if

696
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:27,360
reversed s if
 

697
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,549
reversed s if
c is lower right and then now s 0 and s

698
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:30,559
c is lower right and then now s 0 and s
 

699
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:31,190
c is lower right and then now s 0 and s
1 are

700
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:31,200
1 are
 

701
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,029
1 are
in the reverse or order right so it will

702
00:17:33,029 --> 00:17:33,039
in the reverse or order right so it will
 

703
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,390
in the reverse or order right so it will
be a b

704
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:34,400
be a b
 

705
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,549
be a b
c d and then s 0

706
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:38,559
c d and then s 0
 

707
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,310
c d and then s 0
if i just do this if a b b

708
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:42,320
if i just do this if a b b
 

709
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,950
if i just do this if a b b
c a b b c the s zlo will be a b b c

710
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:46,960
c a b b c the s zlo will be a b b c
 

711
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,950
c a b b c the s zlo will be a b b c
if we filter all the other characters

712
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:48,960
if we filter all the other characters
 

713
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,110
if we filter all the other characters
right and s one will be c

714
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:51,120
right and s one will be c
 

715
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,590
right and s one will be c
b b a in a reverse order right because

716
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:53,600
b b a in a reverse order right because
 

717
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,190
b b a in a reverse order right because
this is reverse order and now

718
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:55,200
this is reverse order and now
 

719
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,430
this is reverse order and now
we just need to check if s zero equals

720
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:57,440
we just need to check if s zero equals
 

721
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,310
we just need to check if s zero equals
everyone right

722
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:58,320
everyone right
 

723
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,470
everyone right
all right yes doesn't make sense right

724
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:02,480
all right yes doesn't make sense right
 

725
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,909
all right yes doesn't make sense right
yeah then what we can just return

726
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:05,919
yeah then what we can just return
 

727
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,470
yeah then what we can just return
something because this is that we can

728
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:08,480
something because this is that we can
 

729
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,110
something because this is that we can
return

730
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:09,120
return
 

731
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,909
return
another function we can call all of it

732
00:18:11,909 --> 00:18:11,919
another function we can call all of it
 

733
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:12,710
another function we can call all of it
all with

734
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:12,720
all with

chip s c l o s one can you tell me what

740
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:23,039
chip s c l o s one can you tell me what
 

741
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,750
chip s c l o s one can you tell me what
it is

742
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:25,760

 

743
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,230

i say it's not a drawing lesson come on

744
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:28,240
i say it's not a drawing lesson come on
 

745
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,990
i say it's not a drawing lesson come on
can you listen to me

746
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:30,000
can you listen to me
 

747
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,029
can you listen to me
all function so the old function with

748
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:33,039
all function so the old function with
 

749
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:33,830
all function so the old function with
return true

750
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:33,840
return true
 

751
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,590
return true
if this condition holds so a equals b

752
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:37,600
if this condition holds so a equals b
 

753
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,590
if this condition holds so a equals b
if chip remember what's give function

754
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:39,600
if chip remember what's give function
 

755
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,350
if chip remember what's give function
array

756
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:41,360
array
 

757
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,029
array
look at the a is one two three

758
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:45,039
look at the a is one two three
 

759
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,310
look at the a is one two three
right b is four five

760
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:48,320
right b is four five
 

761
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,029
right b is four five
six so what's the g function of a b one

762
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:51,039
six so what's the g function of a b one
 

763
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,230
six so what's the g function of a b one
t

764
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:52,240
t
 

765
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,150
t
function of a b what does it what does

766
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:54,160
function of a b what does it what does
 

767
00:18:54,160 --> 00:19:02,470
function of a b what does it what does
it remember

768
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:02,480

 

769
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,070

so you become one four

770
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:06,080
so you become one four
 

771
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,190
so you become one four
two five three six three six

772
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:09,200
two five three six three six
 

773
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,310
two five three six three six
yeah and then look if this is longer

774
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:12,320
yeah and then look if this is longer
 

775
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,990
yeah and then look if this is longer
if it's one is longer right hey

776
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:16,000
if it's one is longer right hey
 

777
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,909
if it's one is longer right hey
if one is longer the second one is

778
00:19:17,909 --> 00:19:17,919
if one is longer the second one is
 

779
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,510
if one is longer the second one is
longer it doesn't take right

780
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:19,520
longer it doesn't take right
 

781
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,510
longer it doesn't take right
like seven it is still written left

782
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:21,520
like seven it is still written left
 

783
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,430
like seven it is still written left
right but we have a deep longest

784
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:23,440
right but we have a deep longest
 

785
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,310
right but we have a deep longest
remember

786
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:24,320
remember
 

787
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,270
remember
we have a deep longest yeah remember

788
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:27,280
we have a deep longest yeah remember
 

789
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,310
we have a deep longest yeah remember
yeah

790
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:28,320
yeah
 

791
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,230
yeah
all right does it make sense deep

792
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:30,240
all right does it make sense deep
 

793
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,150
all right does it make sense deep
longest

794
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:32,160
longest
 

795
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,830
longest
so you take the longest and typically

796
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:33,840
so you take the longest and typically
 

797
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:42,789
so you take the longest and typically
okay but anyway this looks

798
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:42,799

 

799
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:45,909

s1 right if it needs to be the noise

800
00:19:45,909 --> 00:19:45,919
s1 right if it needs to be the noise
 

801
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,430
s1 right if it needs to be the noise
representation it has to be

802
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:47,440
representation it has to be
 

803
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,190
representation it has to be
a equals b for every kind of test right

804
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:51,200
a equals b for every kind of test right
 

805
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,110
a equals b for every kind of test right
yeah when the gpd has to be the same

806
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:53,120
yeah when the gpd has to be the same
 

807
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,909
yeah when the gpd has to be the same
right yeah

808
00:19:55,909 --> 00:19:55,919
right yeah
 

809
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,350
right yeah
okay yeah okay so can we do other

810
00:19:59,350 --> 00:19:59,360
okay yeah okay so can we do other
 

811
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,750
okay yeah okay so can we do other
things here no no no yeah

812
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:03,760
things here no no no yeah
 

813
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,510
things here no no no yeah
no yeah so

814
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:07,520
no yeah so
 

815
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,230
no yeah so
so any other method let me just double

816
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:10,240
so any other method let me just double
 

817
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,390
so any other method let me just double
check i think i think there's other ways

818
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:12,400
check i think i think there's other ways
 

819
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:29,510
check i think i think there's other ways
of doing that

820
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:29,520

 

821
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,270

is that you can directly do this yes

822
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:31,280
is that you can directly do this yes
 

823
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,990
is that you can directly do this yes
define fs

824
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:34,000
define fs
 

825
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,549
define fs
can you take it i'm going to test you

826
00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:36,559
can you take it i'm going to test you
 

827
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,470
can you take it i'm going to test you
okay you need to at least remember one

828
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:38,480
okay you need to at least remember one
 

829
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,149
okay you need to at least remember one
method of doing that okay

830
00:20:40,149 --> 00:20:40,159
method of doing that okay
 

831
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,230
method of doing that okay
we're not looking you can do this number

832
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:42,240
we're not looking you can do this number
 

833
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,830
we're not looking you can do this number

840
00:20:59,029 --> 00:20:59,039
x and x if it's the first version
 

841
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,789
x and x if it's the first version
equals the same right this is the lambda

842
00:21:02,789 --> 00:21:02,799
equals the same right this is the lambda
 

843
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,710
equals the same right this is the lambda
function to check if a string

844
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:04,720
function to check if a string
 

845
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,029
function to check if a string
is if it's uh if it's uh

846
00:21:09,029 --> 00:21:09,039
is if it's uh if it's uh
 

847
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,990
is if it's uh if it's uh
if what if it's a num if it's the

848
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:12,000
if what if it's a num if it's the
 

849
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,830
if what if it's a num if it's the
reverse uh if it's a parenthesis and

850
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:13,840
reverse uh if it's a parenthesis and
 

851
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,390
reverse uh if it's a parenthesis and
then we can fit it into the last thing

852
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:16,400
then we can fit it into the last thing
 

853
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,750
then we can fit it into the last thing
c for c for c in s

854
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:19,760
c for c for c in s
 

855
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,549
c for c for c in s
if s is lower right yeah this is the

856
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:22,559
if s is lower right yeah this is the
 

857
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,149
if s is lower right yeah this is the
biggest thing this is the function we

858
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:24,159
biggest thing this is the function we
 

859
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,830
biggest thing this is the function we
define and we're doing now this is the

the lowercase characters and then
 

943
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,149
the lowercase characters and then
how do you check the how do you filter

944

for c in the s and then what happened
 

953
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:08,950
for c in the s and then what happened
then we want to check if c

954
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:08,960
then we want to check if c
 

955
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:15,510
then we want to check if c
is uh lowercase right in

956

the c dot is lower it's a function so
 

963
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,549
the c dot is lower it's a function so
you need to uh

964

you need to uh
 

965
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:41,269
you need to uh
brackets to call it open bracket close

966
00:24:41,269 --> 00:24:41,279
brackets to call it open bracket close
 

967
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,230
brackets to call it open bracket close
the bracket and i'm using my curly brace

968
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:44,240
the bracket and i'm using my curly brace
 

969
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,230
the bracket and i'm using my curly brace
on a square bracket no no no

okay
 

975
00:24:51,679 --> 00:25:00,440
okay
and then you can write it away 60 yeah

976
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:00,450
and then you can write it away 60 yeah
 

977
