1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,189

hello hello every hello ryan

2
00:00:03,189 --> 00:00:03,199
hello hello every hello ryan
 

3
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:05,510
hello hello every hello ryan
happy new year okay so what we have

4
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:05,520
happy new year okay so what we have
 

5
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:12,230
happy new year okay so what we have
learned yesterday

6
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:12,240

 

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,910

okay if i'm priority kill what's

8
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:14,920
okay if i'm priority kill what's
 

9
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,910
okay if i'm priority kill what's
priority

10
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:17,920
priority
 

11
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,390
priority
smallest number first in priority out

12
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:20,400
smallest number first in priority out
 

13
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,109
smallest number first in priority out
yes

14
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:21,119
yes
 

15
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,310
yes
yeah okay so today what's about priority

16
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:24,320
yeah okay so today what's about priority
 

17
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,630
yeah okay so today what's about priority
queue yeah priority queue so uh so

18
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:26,640
queue yeah priority queue so uh so
 

19
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,109
queue yeah priority queue so uh so
you're given each

20
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:29,119
you're given each
 

21
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,069
you're given each
each number each each element in the

22
00:00:32,069 --> 00:00:32,079
each number each each element in the
 

23
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,910
each number each each element in the
queue has been given a priority

24
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:33,920
queue has been given a priority
 

25
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,630
queue has been given a priority
and then when we kill we call it the q

26
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:36,640
and then when we kill we call it the q
 

27
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,190
and then when we kill we call it the q
the q

28
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:37,200
the q
 

29
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,110
the q
respectively the q is to get the

30
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:41,120
respectively the q is to get the
 

31
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,590
respectively the q is to get the
proper element from the q right so it

32
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:43,600
proper element from the q right so it
 

33
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,150
proper element from the q right so it
would take

34
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:44,160
would take
 

35
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,869
would take
the highest priority right okay so now

36
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:48,879
the highest priority right okay so now
 

37
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,990
the highest priority right okay so now
this is very useful for example that

38
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:52,000
this is very useful for example that
 

39
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,029
this is very useful for example that
we if we have a if we if we

40
00:00:55,029 --> 00:00:55,039
we if we have a if we if we
 

41
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,950
we if we have a if we if we
have a problem like this if we have a

42
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:56,960
have a problem like this if we have a
 

43
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,470
have a problem like this if we have a
few sticks yeah

44
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:58,480
few sticks yeah
 

45
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,910
few sticks yeah
with different lens two four

46
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:01,920
with different lens two four
 

47
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,429
with different lens two four
three and then each time i ask you to

48
00:01:05,429 --> 00:01:05,439
three and then each time i ask you to
 

49
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:05,990
three and then each time i ask you to
merge

50
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:06,000
merge
 

51
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,190
merge
two of them for example much to put it

52
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:09,200
two of them for example much to put it
 

53
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:09,990
two of them for example much to put it
together for

54
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:10,000
together for
 

55
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,750
together for
to connect for example if i take a three

56
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:11,760
to connect for example if i take a three
 

57
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,350
to connect for example if i take a three
and four i

58
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:13,360
and four i
 

59
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,590
and four i
three and four yeah you become seven

60
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:15,600
three and four yeah you become seven
 

61
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,630
three and four yeah you become seven
yeah

62
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:16,640
yeah
 

63
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,270
yeah
so now the the stick will be seven and

64
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:19,280
so now the the stick will be seven and
 

65
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:19,910
so now the the stick will be seven and
two

66
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:19,920
two
 

67
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,390
two
but the cost let the cost to the two lab

68
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:24,400
but the cost let the cost to the two lab
 

69
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,070
but the cost let the cost to the two lab
is seven okay yeah

70
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:28,080
is seven okay yeah
 

71
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,190
is seven okay yeah
and then now i have a two and seven and

72
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:31,200
and then now i have a two and seven and
 

73
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,789
and then now i have a two and seven and
i connected it will be nine right

74
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:32,799
i connected it will be nine right
 

75
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,990
i connected it will be nine right
the cost will be nine right so

76
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:36,000
the cost will be nine right so
 

77
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,990
the cost will be nine right so
when there's only one we end the game

78
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:38,000
when there's only one we end the game
 

79
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,069
when there's only one we end the game
and the cost will be nine plus 7 which

80
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:40,079
and the cost will be nine plus 7 which
 

81
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:40,950
and the cost will be nine plus 7 which
is

82
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:40,960
is
 

83
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,630
is
16 yeah all right so can you think of a

84
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:44,640
16 yeah all right so can you think of a
 

85
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,109
16 yeah all right so can you think of a
way

86
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:45,119
way
 

87
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,710
way
to do this with the minimum cost

88
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:48,720
to do this with the minimum cost
 

89
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,749
to do this with the minimum cost
do you get it for example if this you

90
00:01:51,749 --> 00:01:51,759
do you get it for example if this you
 

91
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,109
do you get it for example if this you
move

92
00:01:53,109 --> 00:01:53,119
move
 

93
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,469
move
you add the put the add and

94
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:56,479
you add the put the add and
 

95
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,830
you add the put the add and
three and four together that would be

96
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:57,840
three and four together that would be
 

97
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,870
three and four together that would be
seven yeah the cost would be seven yeah

98
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:00,880
seven yeah the cost would be seven yeah
 

99
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,590
seven yeah the cost would be seven yeah
and then seven plus two equals nine the

100
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:03,600
and then seven plus two equals nine the
 

101
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,870
and then seven plus two equals nine the
cost will be nine so

102
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:04,880
cost will be nine so
 

103
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,429
cost will be nine so
all together cost will be 16. okay and

104
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:07,439
all together cost will be 16. okay and
 

105
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,350
all together cost will be 16. okay and
another way of doing it if i do these

106
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:09,360
another way of doing it if i do these
 

107
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,550
another way of doing it if i do these
two and three together

108
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:10,560
two and three together
 

109
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,750
two and three together
two plus three will become five right

110
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:13,760
two plus three will become five right
 

111
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,110
two plus three will become five right
first would be five yeah sorry and then

112
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:17,120
first would be five yeah sorry and then
 

113
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:17,430
first would be five yeah sorry and then
four

114
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:17,440
four
 

115
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,949
four
plus four f five plus four equals nine

116
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:20,959
plus four f five plus four equals nine
 

117
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,589
plus four f five plus four equals nine
and the cost will be 9 so the cost is

118
00:02:23,589 --> 00:02:23,599
and the cost will be 9 so the cost is
 

119
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,750
and the cost will be 9 so the cost is
14.

120
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:25,760
14.
 

121
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,910
14.
get it so this is better than this do

122
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:27,920
get it so this is better than this do
 

123
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,589
get it so this is better than this do
you get it

124
00:02:29,589 --> 00:02:29,599
you get it
 

125
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,430
you get it
yeah so every time we pick 2

126
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:33,440
yeah so every time we pick 2
 

127
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,470
yeah so every time we pick 2
we merge it connected to each other and

128
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:36,480
we merge it connected to each other and
 

129
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,309
we merge it connected to each other and
the cost will be the total length of

130
00:02:38,309 --> 00:02:38,319
the cost will be the total length of
 

131
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,509
the cost will be the total length of
this

132
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:39,519
this
 

133
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,589
this
the new new stick after merge

134
00:02:43,589 --> 00:02:43,599
the new new stick after merge
 

135
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,030
the new new stick after merge
and when there's only one when there's

136
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:47,040
and when there's only one when there's
 

137
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,509
and when there's only one when there's
only one when every

138
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:49,519
only one when every
 

139
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,990
only one when every
stakes are merged into one and then we

140
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,000
stakes are merged into one and then we
 

141
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,750
stakes are merged into one and then we
end the game and the cost will be the

142
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:53,760
end the game and the cost will be the
 

143
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,470
end the game and the cost will be the
total

144
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:54,480
total
 

145
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,750
total
the tokens caught after uh at each match

146
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:57,760
the tokens caught after uh at each match
 

147
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,070
the tokens caught after uh at each match
do you understand this problem yeah yeah

148
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,080
do you understand this problem yeah yeah
 

149
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,869
do you understand this problem yeah yeah
i mean

150
00:03:00,869 --> 00:03:00,879
i mean
 

151
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,750
i mean
so any idea any idea how can we do it

152
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:05,760
so any idea any idea how can we do it
 

153
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,990
so any idea any idea how can we do it
do we have a strategy how can we do it

154
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,000
do we have a strategy how can we do it
 

155
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,190
do we have a strategy how can we do it
with the minimum cost

156
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:09,200
with the minimum cost
 

157
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,550
with the minimum cost
so obviously this is 16 this is 14.

158
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:12,560
so obviously this is 16 this is 14.
 

159
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,990
so obviously this is 16 this is 14.
i think you just add the two smallest

160
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,000
i think you just add the two smallest
 

161
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,790
i think you just add the two smallest
whoa where's that why yeah it's true

162
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:18,800
whoa where's that why yeah it's true
 

163
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,550
whoa where's that why yeah it's true
you've always picked the smallest

164
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:20,560
you've always picked the smallest
 

165
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,869
you've always picked the smallest
yeah yeah i can show i can

166
00:03:24,869 --> 00:03:24,879
yeah yeah i can show i can
 

167
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,190
yeah yeah i can show i can
i can tell you why this is a good

168
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:27,200
i can tell you why this is a good
 

169
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,630
i can tell you why this is a good
strategy greedy

170
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:28,640
strategy greedy
 

171
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,869
strategy greedy
greedy yeah greedy how cool makes me

172
00:03:30,869 --> 00:03:30,879
greedy yeah greedy how cool makes me
 

173
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,830
greedy yeah greedy how cool makes me
hungry yeah greedy so pick the smoke

174
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:33,840
hungry yeah greedy so pick the smoke
 

175
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,949
hungry yeah greedy so pick the smoke
two smallest two smallest every time

176
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:36,959
two smallest two smallest every time
 

177
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,229
two smallest two smallest every time
two smallest yeah two smallest okay so

178
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:40,239
two smallest yeah two smallest okay so
 

179
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:41,910
two smallest yeah two smallest okay so
for example if we have a four

180
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:41,920
for example if we have a four
 

181
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,190
for example if we have a four
four for example four a one let's call

182
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:45,200
four for example four a one let's call
 

183
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,309
four for example four a one let's call
it a b c d

184
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:46,319
it a b c d
 

185
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,670
it a b c d
okay just two lengths left if there are

186
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:49,680
okay just two lengths left if there are
 

187
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,229
okay just two lengths left if there are
two

188
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:50,239
two
 

189
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,990
two
there are four lengths and let's merge

190
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:52,000
there are four lengths and let's merge
 

191
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,750
there are four lengths and let's merge
it from the left to the right

192
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:53,760
it from the left to the right
 

193
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,750
it from the left to the right
let's budget from the left to right so

194
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:55,760
let's budget from the left to right so
 

195
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,869
let's budget from the left to right so
first of all

196
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:56,879
first of all
 

197
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,990
first of all
a plus b yeah the cost is a plus

198
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,000
a plus b yeah the cost is a plus
 

199
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,789
a plus b yeah the cost is a plus
b right this is the cost we want to add

200
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:02,799
b right this is the cost we want to add
 

201
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:03,509
b right this is the cost we want to add
and then

202
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:03,519
and then
 

203
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,750
and then
now yeah it's just symbol

204
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:07,760
now yeah it's just symbol
 

205
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,229
now yeah it's just symbol
we don't know the value but it's a plus

206
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:10,239
we don't know the value but it's a plus
 

207
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:11,509
we don't know the value but it's a plus
and then a plus b

208
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:11,519
and then a plus b
 

209
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,949
and then a plus b
plus c the cost will be a plus b

210
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:14,959
plus c the cost will be a plus b
 

211
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,349
plus c the cost will be a plus b
plus c right yeah and then another match

212
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:19,359
plus c right yeah and then another match
 

213
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,790
plus c right yeah and then another match
another magic a plus b plus c plus b

214
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:22,800
another magic a plus b plus c plus b
 

215
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,310
another magic a plus b plus c plus b
the cost will be a plus b plus c plus b

216
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:26,320
the cost will be a plus b plus c plus b
 

217
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,030
the cost will be a plus b plus c plus b
so how many a how many b how many c's

218
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:29,040
so how many a how many b how many c's
 

219
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,590
so how many a how many b how many c's
there are

220
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:29,600
there are
 

221
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,710
there are
three a three

222
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:31,720
three a three
 

223
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,950
three a three
[Music]

224
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:32,960
[Music]
 

225
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,950
[Music]
two one okay so these are four numbers

226
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:36,960
two one okay so these are four numbers
 

227
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,030
two one okay so these are four numbers
and these a and b needs two times three

228
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:39,040
and these a and b needs two times three
 

229
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,390
and these a and b needs two times three
times and this c is

230
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:40,400
times and this c is
 

231
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,670
times and this c is
times two times and d times one time so

232
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:43,680
times two times and d times one time so
 

233
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,830
times two times and d times one time so
if these are the smallest the chords

234
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:45,840
if these are the smallest the chords
 

235
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,270
if these are the smallest the chords
will be smaller is that

236
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:47,280
will be smaller is that
 

237
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,590
will be smaller is that
if the is the biggest if a and b are the

238
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:49,600
if the is the biggest if a and b are the
 

239
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,590
if the is the biggest if a and b are the
biggest the chords will be biggest yeah

240
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:51,600
biggest the chords will be biggest yeah
 

241
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,909
biggest the chords will be biggest yeah
so the a and b must be the smallest all

242
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:53,919
so the a and b must be the smallest all
 

243
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:54,790
so the a and b must be the smallest all
right

244
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:54,800
right
 

245
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,990
right
yes do you get it if look look

246
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,000
yes do you get it if look look
 

247
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,749
yes do you get it if look look
if if we even really put it one

248
00:05:01,749 --> 00:05:01,759
if if we even really put it one
 

249
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,029
if if we even really put it one
two three four so this a will be

250
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:05,039
two three four so this a will be
 

251
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,629
two three four so this a will be
one three no no no a

252
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:08,639
one three no no no a
 

253
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,029
one three no no no a
a would be i'll be choosing one right

254
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:11,039
a would be i'll be choosing one right
 

255
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,870
a would be i'll be choosing one right
because if i choose two

256
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:12,880
because if i choose two
 

257
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,430
because if i choose two
or just a and b will be one and two if i

258
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:15,440
or just a and b will be one and two if i
 

259
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,629
or just a and b will be one and two if i
choose four

260
00:05:16,629 --> 00:05:16,639
choose four
 

261
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,350
choose four
the cost will be maximized right because

262
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:19,360
the cost will be maximized right because
 

263
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,469
the cost will be maximized right because
it comes three times

264
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:20,479
it comes three times
 

265
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,189
it comes three times
right three times a times plus three

266
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:23,199
right three times a times plus three
 

267
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,830
right three times a times plus three
times b so a and b must be one or two

268
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:25,840
times b so a and b must be one or two
 

269
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,469
times b so a and b must be one or two
and then two two c will be two look if

270
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:28,479
and then two two c will be two look if
 

271
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:29,749
and then two two c will be two look if
two times three

272
00:05:29,749 --> 00:05:29,759
two times three
 

273
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,150
two times three
plus four and then two times four plus

274
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:32,160
plus four and then two times four plus
 

275
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,469
plus four and then two times four plus
three which one is bigger

276
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:36,479

 

277
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,790

this is 10 this is 11. of course i need

278
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:38,800
this is 10 this is 11. of course i need
 

279
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,749
this is 10 this is 11. of course i need
to because this

280
00:05:39,749 --> 00:05:39,759
to because this
 

281
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,710
to because this
times 2 so c is to be smaller right got

282
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:42,720
times 2 so c is to be smaller right got
 

283
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,029
times 2 so c is to be smaller right got
it

284
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:43,039
it
 

285
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,469
it
because 2 times c plus d

286
00:05:46,469 --> 00:05:46,479
because 2 times c plus d
 

287
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,909
because 2 times c plus d
if c is 3 and d is 4. i obviously i want

288
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:49,919
if c is 3 and d is 4. i obviously i want
 

289
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:50,710
if c is 3 and d is 4. i obviously i want
to see

290
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:50,720
to see
 

291
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,950
to see
smallest because it's times two right if

292
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:52,960
smallest because it's times two right if
 

293
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,790
smallest because it's times two right if
you pick the four that would be two

294
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:54,800
you pick the four that would be two
 

295
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,070
you pick the four that would be two
times four

296
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:56,080
times four
 

297
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,510
times four
bigger than three am i right yeah

298
00:05:59,510 --> 00:05:59,520
bigger than three am i right yeah
 

299
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,110
bigger than three am i right yeah
bigger than that i'm picking the three

300
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:01,120
bigger than that i'm picking the three
 

301
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,629
bigger than that i'm picking the three
together yes

302
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:02,639
together yes
 

303
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,029
together yes
so the strategy i just proved like it's

304
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:05,039
so the strategy i just proved like it's
 

305
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:05,830
so the strategy i just proved like it's
always

306
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:05,840
always
 

307
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,629
always
optimum to pick the two smallest in the

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,550
here right cos equals yeah and then cos
it will be

00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:12,560
it will be
 

405
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,469
it will be

00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:23,039
b b okay then now i need to add the a
 

411
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,629
b b okay then now i need to add the a
plus b this is the new

plus b this is the new
 

413
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,189
plus b this is the new
stick i need to put it back to the

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,269
yeah because it becomes a new stick so
now what hq

433
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,470

so what's the complexity i went no

434
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:10,480
so what's the complexity i went no
 

435
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,750
so what's the complexity i went no
no are you logan now you're just

436
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:13,760
no are you logan now you're just
 

437
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,470
no are you logan now you're just
guessing

438
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:14,480

look there are an element in a stick

440
00:09:16,949 --> 00:09:16,959
look there are an element in a stick
 

441
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:17,670
look there are an element in a stick
yeah yeah

442
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:17,680
yeah yeah
 

443
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,389
yeah yeah
so it's in this end but every time we

444
00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:20,399
so it's in this end but every time we
 

445
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,430
so it's in this end but every time we
are push

446
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:21,440
are push
 

447
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,990
are push
popping and push it takes log n remember

448
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:24,000
popping and push it takes log n remember
 

449
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,710
popping and push it takes log n remember
so this is

450
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:24,720

you look this
thing vian is to edit it so this is the

584
00:12:59,030 --> 00:12:59,040
thing vian is to edit it so this is the
 

585
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:14,069
thing vian is to edit it so this is the
program about today the complexities

586
00:13:14,069 --> 00:13:14,079

 

587
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,310

yeah n is the number of the stick in the
 

589
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,509
yeah n is the number of the stick in the
original way

590
00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:17,519
original way
 

591
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,269
original way
right so how about you let's try this

592
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:21,279
right so how about you let's try this
 

593
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:27,990
right so how about you let's try this
let's try maybe just put some numbers

594
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:28,000

 

595
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,110

i don't know but this is yeah yeah

596
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:31,120
i don't know but this is yeah yeah
 

597
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,870
i don't know but this is yeah yeah
because it's take a look

598
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:34,880
because it's take a look
 

599
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,790
because it's take a look
basically put it pick the two and three

600
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:36,800
basically put it pick the two and three
 

601
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,110
basically put it pick the two and three
first but let's do a one more small one

602
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:39,120
first but let's do a one more small one
 

603
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,790
first but let's do a one more small one
