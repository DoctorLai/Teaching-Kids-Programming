00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:42,799
sure right
 

171
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,910
sure right
yeah yeah we want to calculate this

172
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:45,920
yeah yeah we want to calculate this
 

173
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,390
yeah yeah we want to calculate this
answer and return answer here

174
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:48,400
answer and return answer here
 

175
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,869
answer and return answer here
okay okay so why

176
00:03:52,869 --> 00:03:52,879
okay okay so why
 

177
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,990
okay okay so why
why n n is the current buttons

178
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,000
why n n is the current buttons
 

179
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,229
why n n is the current buttons
right why

180
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:00,239
right why
 

181
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,070
right why
and is bigger than three

182
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:04,080
and is bigger than three
 

183
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,390
and is bigger than three
or equal three because when it's bigger

184
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:06,400
or equal three because when it's bigger
 

185
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,390
or equal three because when it's bigger
than three we can exchange right

186
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:08,400
than three we can exchange right
 

187
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,670
than three we can exchange right
all right i exchanged how exchange

188
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:11,680
all right i exchanged how exchange
 

189
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:19,030
all right i exchanged how exchange
equals

190
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:19,040

 

191
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,069

and then this exchange then we can we

192
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:22,079
and then this exchange then we can we
 

193
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,350
and then this exchange then we can we
can drink it right

194
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:23,360
can drink it right
 

195
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,510
can drink it right
so what should we do with the answer

196
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:25,520
so what should we do with the answer
 

197
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,830
so what should we do with the answer
plus equal

198
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:26,840
plus equal
 

199
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:38,710
plus equal
extend

200
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:38,720

 

201
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,390

because we have this exchange right

202
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:40,400
because we have this exchange right
 

203
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,230
because we have this exchange right
we're going to we can drink it

204
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:42,240
we're going to we can drink it
 

205
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,990
we're going to we can drink it
but now n equals

206
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:46,000
but now n equals
 

207
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,150
but now n equals
what and n is the number of the boxes

208
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:52,160

 

209
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,189

multiply three

210
00:04:57,189 --> 00:04:57,199
multiply three
 

211
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,189
multiply three
look because we already use the divided

212
00:04:59,189 --> 00:04:59,199
look because we already use the divided
 

213
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,110
look because we already use the divided
by three and then this is the remaining

214
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:01,120
by three and then this is the remaining
 

215
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,070
by three and then this is the remaining
right

216
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:02,080
right
 

217
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,590
right
this is the remaining empty button plus

218
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:05,600
this is the remaining empty button plus
 

219
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,469
this is the remaining empty button plus
plus one we have yeah we're done yeah

220
00:05:08,469 --> 00:05:08,479
plus one we have yeah we're done yeah
 

221
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,029
plus one we have yeah we're done yeah
because we already drink this exchange

222
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:11,039
because we already drink this exchange
 

223
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,230
because we already drink this exchange
and this is the new

224
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:12,240
and this is the new
 

225
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,629
and this is the new
empty bottle right this is the previous

226
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:14,639
empty bottle right this is the previous
 

227
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,590
empty bottle right this is the previous
empty bottle

228
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:15,600
empty bottle
 

229
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,469
empty bottle
the new the the new empty buttons is and

230
00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:18,479
the new the the new empty buttons is and
 

231
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:19,189
the new the the new empty buttons is and
then we go

232
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:19,199
then we go
 

233
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,830
then we go
closer let's see what's the time

234
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:22,840
closer let's see what's the time
 

235
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,830
closer let's see what's the time
complexity

236
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:25,840
complexity
 

237
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,830
complexity
you see every time we divide by three we

238
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:27,840
you see every time we divide by three we
 

239
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,029
you see every time we divide by three we
divide it right

240
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:29,039
divide it right
 

241
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,390
divide it right
too big and one uh

242
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:32,400
too big and one uh
 

243
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,189
too big and one uh
then no no it's quite cool it's not it's

244
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:35,199
then no no it's quite cool it's not it's
 

245
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,230
then no no it's quite cool it's not it's
the other way

246
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:36,240
the other way
 

247
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,430
the other way
you know it's the other way and

248
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:39,440
you know it's the other way and
 

249
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:45,830
you know it's the other way and
key you're nice what's owen

250
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:45,840

 

251
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,350

all right o and qp that's what ryan said

252
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:49,360
all right o and qp that's what ryan said
 

253
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,629
all right o and qp that's what ryan said
but i said this is

254
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:50,639
but i said this is
 

255
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,550
but i said this is
the opposite what's that oh

256
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:54,560
the opposite what's that oh
 

257
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,670
the opposite what's that oh
no no not the opposite log three base

258
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:57,680
no no not the opposite log three base
 

259
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,790
no no not the opposite log three base
annually

260
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:58,800
annually
 

261
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,029
annually
yeah why is that look every time we

262
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:01,039
yeah why is that look every time we
 

263
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:01,830
yeah why is that look every time we
divide

264
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:01,840
divide
 

265
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,510
divide
by three and then we yeah

266
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:05,520
by three and then we yeah
 

267
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,029
by three and then we yeah
okay look at why is that look nine

268
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:09,039
okay look at why is that look nine
 

269
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,830
okay look at why is that look nine
three one yeah how many threes can it

270
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:11,840
three one yeah how many threes can it
 

271
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,629
three one yeah how many threes can it
can you be

272
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:12,639
can you be
 

273
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,469
can you be
so every time you divide by three right

274
00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:14,479
so every time you divide by three right
 

275
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,270
so every time you divide by three right
right three divided by

276
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:17,280
right three divided by
 

277
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,670
right three divided by
three equals one one divided by three

278
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:21,680
three equals one one divided by three
 

279
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,950
three equals one one divided by three
yeah so because that the thing is y

280
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:24,960
yeah so because that the thing is y
 

281
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,710
yeah so because that the thing is y
and bigger than three so every time we

282
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:26,720
and bigger than three so every time we
 

283
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,309
and bigger than three so every time we
divided by three divided by

284
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:28,319
divided by three divided by
 

285
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,150
divided by three divided by
every time we divided by two by divided

286
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:30,160
every time we divided by two by divided
 

287
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,830
every time we divided by two by divided
by two let's log n right

288
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:31,840
by two let's log n right
 

289
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,790
by two let's log n right
base two now is log three yeah doesn't

290
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:34,800
base two now is log three yeah doesn't
 

291
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,230
base two now is log three yeah doesn't
make sense er

292
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:36,240
make sense er
 

293
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,110
make sense er
yeah can you tell me can you tell me can

294
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:39,120
yeah can you tell me can you tell me can
 

295
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,070
yeah can you tell me can you tell me can
you explain to me

296
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,080
you explain to me
 

297
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,590
you explain to me
what is this yeah

298
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:43,600
what is this yeah
 

299
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,830
what is this yeah
yeah okay so well n bigger than three

300
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:47,840
yeah okay so well n bigger than three
 

301
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,950
yeah okay so well n bigger than three
then we can x

302
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:48,960
then we can x
 

303
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,230
then we can x
gain yeah we have that

304
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:52,240
gain yeah we have that
 

305
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,589
gain yeah we have that
exchange equals like x like if it was

306
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:55,599
exchange equals like x like if it was
 

307
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:56,150
exchange equals like x like if it was
nine

308
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:56,160
nine
 

309
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,189
nine
you divided by three which is three yeah

310
00:06:59,189 --> 00:06:59,199
you divided by three which is three yeah
 

311
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,150
you divided by three which is three yeah
and then the answer cost three exchange

312
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:02,160
and then the answer cost three exchange
 

313
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:02,469
and then the answer cost three exchange
which

314
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:02,479
which
 

315
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,670
which
is three so nine plus three is

316
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:05,680
is three so nine plus three is
 

317
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,950
is three so nine plus three is
twelve okay and then n equals n

318
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:08,960
twelve okay and then n equals n
 

319
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,550
twelve okay and then n equals n
modulus three plus the exchange

320
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:12,560
modulus three plus the exchange
 

321
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,350
modulus three plus the exchange
and three divided by three equals one

322
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:15,360
and three divided by three equals one
 

323
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:15,990
and three divided by three equals one
and

324
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:16,000
and
 

325
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,790
and
and one is exchanged so nine plus three

326
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:18,800
and one is exchanged so nine plus three
 

327
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,710
and one is exchanged so nine plus three
plus one equals thirteen

328
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:20,720
plus one equals thirteen
 

329
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,110
plus one equals thirteen
okay so what's this why why we adding

330
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:23,120
okay so what's this why why we adding
 

331
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,110
okay so what's this why why we adding
this exchange

332
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:25,120
this exchange
 

333
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,990
this exchange
why if we can why can you explain to me

334
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:30,000
why if we can why can you explain to me
 

335
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,909
why if we can why can you explain to me
in words not the numbers

336
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:33,919
in words not the numbers
 

337
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,469
in words not the numbers
