1
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,879
okay

2
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,559
okay so today we are going to talk about

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:10,800
a very interesting problem called the

4
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:14,000
visible blocks okay so let's say we have

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,920
n blocks yeah we have really interesting

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,800
and

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,800
blocks come on come on

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,000
we have n blocks

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,359
and the size is one to n okay so look

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,400
this is one point

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,480
you you

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,480
uh you know the number of blocks yeah

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,480
one

14
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,879
okay let's say

15
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,559
we have four blocks n equals four

16
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,960
and then

17
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:53,600
the blocks type is one two three four

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,480
okay so if if okay eric or ryan you know

19
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,960
yeah

20
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,879
sunny on the left look

21
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,000
how many blocks can you see

22
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,000
how many blocks can you see

23
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:08,640
ryan eric how many dots can you see all

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,840
of them all of them four right yeah

25
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,720
exactly how about this

26
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,200
probably

27
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,680
so if you hear

28
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,880
to the right how many blocks can you see

29
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,840
i could see one two three

30
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,360
four

31
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,920
one one yeah exactly yeah okay so the

32
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,680
question is that i have unblocked right

33
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,600
and i'm standing on the left

34
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,680
i'm standing on the left

35
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,439
right

36
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,040
and i want to see

37
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:41,920
exactly k blocks right so how many ways

38
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,880
how many ways can we arrange the blocks

39
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,240
do you get it for example if n

40
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,520
if n

41
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,520
if k equals 1

42
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,399
okay if k

43
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,600
let's say if k equals n n equals k so

44
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,479
for example

45
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,479
i have m blocks i want to see exactly k

46
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,680
blocks how many ways can we arrange in a

47
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,040
box

48
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,840
uh always the tallest one and

49
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,800
then

50
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:13,520
i didn't really get it okay so look

51
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,599
you you're getting there right so i have

52
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,599
uh i have uh four blocks and i want to

53
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,080
see exactly four blocks how many ways i

54
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,080
can put it

55
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:25,040
right so look at one two three

56
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,520
only one right exactly because you can't

57
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,200
that's the only order if you if you if

58
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,959
you if you don't if we don't have this

59
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,120
order some blocks will be invisible

60
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,000
we'll be we'll be blocking others right

61
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,599
yeah there's only one right okay that's

62
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,120
very good so when n equally equals k

63
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,120
then we should return one because

64
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,040
there's only one right from the smallest

65
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,879
to the biggest all right

66
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:51,120
okay how about k equals one

67
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,440
so i want to see exactly one block so

68
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,360
there's always a tool

69
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,360
in the front where that very well done

70
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,599
so always the tallest but how about

71
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,239
these it doesn't matter right

72
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:05,440
okay so how many blocks are there

73
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,120
uh three yeah there are n blocks overall

74
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,200
and i have one block the tallest in the

75
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,360
front so how many blocks here n minus

76
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,040
one and minus one okay so far four it

77
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,120
doesn't matter you say it doesn't matter

78
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,440
so n minus one blocks doesn't matter how

79
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,840
many permutations

80
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,840
we want to talk about how many orders i

81
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,760
mean what

82
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,760
times yeah you kind of do it look at

83
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,159
three three three blocks how many

84
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,640
permutations how many ways

85
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,720
exactly how the first block we have

86
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,040
three choice the second block we have

87
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,560
two choice the third one we have one

88
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,920
choice what's this

89
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,480
what's this

90
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,760
six yeah i know what's these five

91
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:47,599
we're done so n minus one factorial yeah

92
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,879
exactly okay so when k equals one we

93
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,040
return

94
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,000
n minus one factorial

95
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,159
right

96
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,959
exactly okay now tricky part is here

97
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,720
yeah

98
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,959
this is the difficult part if you don't

99
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,120
get that's fine right but that's very

100
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,879
good if you can if you you can already

101
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,879
get these two parts that's very nice

102
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,239
okay yeah

103
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,159
okay so now

104
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,560
this is these two are base cases very

105
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,840
easy yeah okay so now

106
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,319
how about

107
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,040
how about n is not equal k and k all is

108
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:20,160
not equal one so look

109
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,600
yeah so how about that uh i have uh m

110
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,680
blocks right

111
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,680
and then how about if i put the smallest

112
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,199
one in the front okay let's say i want

113
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,080
to put the smallest one in the front

114
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,280
right

115
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,960
right

116
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,040
yeah so

117
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,600
i can always see it right because it's

118
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:39,600
smallest in the front right yeah

119
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:42,000
yeah i can see it so let's say f and fnk

120
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,400
is the number of ways that i i need to

121
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,440
place in blocks and with i want to see

122
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,360
the k visible blocks right yeah right

123
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,880
actually

124
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,600
so now i

125
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,880
put the one block at the beginning the

126
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,919
smallest

127
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:00,720
right and how many blocks left

128
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,560
how many blocks left

129
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,800
i put one block in the front how many

130
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,840
blocks left minus one and minus one

131
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,880
where down

132
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,280
right

133
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:12,479
and i can see one blocks how many more

134
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,080
blocks i need to see i need to make it c

135
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,800
also minus one right

136
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,880
so that's k minus one right yeah when we

137
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,919
put the smallest what why can we do this

138
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,199
k minus one because this is the smallest

139
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,280
right

140
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,600
if this is smallest what happened i i

141
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,280
can see all the blocks on the right hand

142
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,400
side right

143
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:35,120
so let's f let's f n minus one k myself

144
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,039
okay that's one path if i don't pull the

145
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,639
smallest on the left

146
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,800
okay this is the tricky part if i don't

147
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,400
put the smallest in on the

148
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,840
on the left on the left

149
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,720
i can put it

150
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:50,400
in n minus one position right i can put

151
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:54,240
it any minus one position right yeah but

152
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:56,880
i still need to to see k blocks right

153
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,360
because this block is invisible right

154
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,600
because it's the smallest so in my east

155
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,120
smallest it means that it's it's

156
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,440
invisible

157
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,759
the left most block

158
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,960
blocks it right

159
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,919
so it's

160
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,039
f n minus one k

161
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,840
okay

162
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,080
yeah

163
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,160
so how many ways we can do this i i was

164
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,400
just saying i have i can place the block

165
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,960
in minus one position so we can just

166
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,000
times it right

167
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,360
yeah

168
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,919
so how many ways

169
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,600
for these two we we do it add it

170
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,600
together

171
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,720
okay cool so

172
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,919
so

173
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:38,319
you get it right let me repeat it okay

174
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,759
let me repeat it this is a bit tricky

175
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,039
part okay

176
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,039
okay let me repeat it

177
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,400
can you stand here for a while

178
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,759
okay listen one more time this is very

179
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,120
interesting okay

180
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,440
ryan you got it

181
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,840
n minus n equals k there's only one way

182
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,240
right from the smallest to biggest k

183
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,000
equals one

184
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,039
what does it mean the tallest on the

185
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,599
left

186
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:05,759
right and what what's on the right

187
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,520
doesn't matter and there are n minus one

188
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,960
blocks here so it doesn't matter what

189
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,960
does it mean it doesn't matter we can do

190
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,960
this full permutation on n minus one

191
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,680
block that gives us n minus one

192
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,240
factorial okay so now

193
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,720
for the end and blocks we want to see k

194
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,120
blocks yeah oh total and block so we

195
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,120
want to see k blocks

196
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,440
are we right

197
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,840
why are you doing what you're doing

198
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,520
yeah and blocks i want to see k block

199
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,599
what happened if i put the smallest on

200
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,680
the left

201
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,680
i can see it right

202
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,080
so if i put the smallest on the left i

203
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,199
can see so the these how many ways i can

204
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,400
do it

205
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,440
that's n

206
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:48,240
f n minus one k minus one why because i

207
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,639
put i i already put one blocks here

208
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,879
so i have n minus one blocks left and i

209
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,680
have k minus one blocks left to seen

210
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,479
right

211
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,479
but if i don't put it on the left

212
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,800
if i don't put it on the left

213
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,479
i put it somewhere from the right on the

214
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,160
right hand side because it's the

215
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,840
smallest block

216
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,800
it's invisible

217
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,759
all right

218
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,639
if it is input if it's invisible so what

219
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,759
does it mean if it's invisible then we

220
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,319
still

221
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,479
have k blocks left to sing and we have n

222
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,599
minus one block but how many ways can we

223
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,479
do this

224
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,639
n minus one times it why is that because

225
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:28,560
we can place this smallest plot from n

226
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:31,120
minus one position okay

227
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,680
so now we can implement this

228
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:36,800
we have this uh equation so how can we

229
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,399
implement it anybody

230
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,640
if we have we i already have this

231
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,880
defined f n n k

232
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:45,920
equals okay let's say

233
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,519
n minus 1 factorial

234
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,440
when

235
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,200
k is 1

236
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,040
over 1

237
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,720
when

238
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,880
k is n

239
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:01,120
and otherwise

240
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:02,480
otherwise what f n minus 1 k minus 1

241
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,560
plus

242
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,560
n minus 1 times

243
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,680
s n minus 1.

244
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,440
okay all right so alois

245
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:15,360
so we have defined this how can we

246
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:18,399
implement this look what's this f of n k

247
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,839
f n minus 1 f1 minus 1 k minus 1 what

248
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:24,240
what do we do with

249
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:25,600
this to implement this

250
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,839
if you look at this

251
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,839
f let's f what how do you implement this

252
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,640
what what do we call it

253
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:36,640
[Music]

254
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,920
where with cushion wow you're on fire

255
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,920
today recursion yeah

256
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,519
i know that's a

257
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,360
metaphor

258
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:49,519
that's a metaphor saying okay you're so

259
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:52,959
good today okay wait why burning good

260
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:55,120
okay f and k right okay and that

261
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:58,160
we have to i also give if it is zero

262
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,880
when n is smaller than

263
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,640
k right it makes sense

264
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,040
when n is smaller than k what happened

265
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,120
what value should we get if we have n

266
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,760
plus we want to see k plus k is bigger

267
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,000
than n how many ways can we do it zero

268
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,519
exactly that's common sense yeah we have

269
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,959
three blocks we want to see four blocks

270
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,480
how is it possible

271
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:19,279
yeah yeah

272
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:22,320
so if n smaller than k

273
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,600
we tend zero

274
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,200
okay

275
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,000
so if

276
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,360
k is one

277
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,040
we tend

278
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,120
n minus one structure we talked about

279
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,360
factorial yeah we can use the math dot

280
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,800
bacterial thing

281
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,959
yeah factorial

282
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,959
okay n minus one

283
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:44,560
if

284
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:48,079
n equals equals k we return

285
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:51,760
one exactly otherwise will return

286
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:53,200
f n minus one k minus one plus

287
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,640
n minus one

288
00:10:53,200 --> 00:11:00,560
times f n minus one k okay so that's the

289
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:03,440
recursion look look one f and k

290
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,880
right n is always decrementing by one

291
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,600
right but k

292
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:10,160
sometimes equilibrium sometimes not

293
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,279
so what does it mean look if n is always

294
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:16,320
decrementing one right and n is

295
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:18,640
smaller is bigger than n

296
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:22,480
n is bigger than k right so what does it

297
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:25,600
mean either k reaches one first or n

298
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,600
reaches k first so in that case we

299
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,440
define these two

300
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,880
terminal condition now

301
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,279
that could be

302
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,920
sufficient less sufficient yeah because

303
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:39,519
n is always decrementing one

304
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:42,880
look okay so n is bigger than k right

305
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:46,560
n is always decrementing one but k

306
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,360
sometimes not equipment so it means that

307
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,120
k

308
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,720
will reach one first or n will reach k

309
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,519
first right

310
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,279
yeah so we have these two so

311
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,200
ryan do you understand this do you

312
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:01,440
understand this do you understand this

313
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,920
and do you understand this

314
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,160
anyway do you understand these 12 bits

315
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,399
list this this

316
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:12,480
the first three you understand

317
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,480
obviously yeah how about this one

318
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,000
yeah okay let me repeat this okay this

319
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,200
is a little bit difficult to understand

320
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,519
okay but don't worry okay it's hard yeah

321
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,639
i know that's why i'm repeating one more

322
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,440
time okay

323
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:29,440
okay all right for the last time come on

324
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,040
for the last time

325
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,040
yeah

326
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,880
so

327
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,040
f and k

328
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,040
means that i have

329
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,839
n blocks and i want to see k blocks

330
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,959
right

331
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:46,079
and let's place let's try to place

332
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:47,600
the smallest block on the left yeah so

333
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:51,519
what does it mean if i place the

334
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:54,240
smallest block on the left can i see it

335
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,560
can i see it yeah yeah yeah obviously i

336
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,320
put a smallie from the left

337
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,360
i put anything on the left i can see it

338
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,360
right

339
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,399
so if i put a smallest on the left i

340
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,480
have

341
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,160
n minus one block right because i

342
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,959
already use one block and how many

343
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:12,000
blocks left to sing

344
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:14,240
k minus one right because i i look f and

345
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,240
k i want to place m blocks

346
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:19,279
i see k blocks i put a smallies on the

347
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:22,560
left i have n minus one block and i

348
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:25,440
i have k minus one blocks to sim okay

349
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:28,160
let's see this part how about this one

350
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,920
if i don't play on this left most i can

351
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,560
put it on

352
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,800
n y and minus one position right because

353
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,959
they're total and plus if i put the

354
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,680
smallest block on the right what does

355
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,399
this mean can i see it

356
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,480
no

357
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:45,199
no obviously because look this small is

358
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,680
blocked i can put it on the right

359
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:50,160
i can put it in m minus one position but

360
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,920
it's the smallest what does it mean

361
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,279
it can't be seen right

362
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,120
you will be definitely blocked by the

363
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,279
leftmost block right

364
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:00,560
so i have

365
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:03,600
still n minus one profit to use and i i

366
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:06,560
still need to see k blocks but how many

367
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,720
pro as i said i have n minus n minus 1

368
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:11,600
positions to put a smaller spell so i

369
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,760
need to times this by n minus one

370
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,160
correct that's where we come from right

371
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,279
this is mathematics actually this is not

372
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,839
coding

373
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:22,320
this is mathematics

374
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,000
yeah mathematic equation

375
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,920
the most important thing today is this

376
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,120
mathematic equation how we getting how

377
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,720
we solving this

378
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,959
we're using computer this is just

379
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,480
implementation of this mathematics look

380
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,880
you can figure out

381
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,760
from this python code it's easy right

382
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,959
yeah the python code no skills

383
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,880
yeah

384
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,800
we can put a cache yeah we can put a

385
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,279
cache to remember the values we have

386
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,880
seen yeah but i doubt that this would be

387
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:50,480
useful because the

388
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:52,079
n would be based on n minus 1

389
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,440
k minus 1

390
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:56,720
k

391
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:59,279
yeah maybe yeah so

392
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:03,680
it's not reusing it right it's not

393
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,680
uh do we we use the intermediate results

394
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,959
that's a good question let's try okay

395
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:11,600
f let's say f

396
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:13,760
n minus 1 k minus 1

397
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,560
that would be based on

398
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:19,680
that will be based on what

399
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:23,839
no f and k f and k will be based on m

400
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:25,440
minus 1 k minus 1 and n minus 1

401
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,839
k right

402
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,160
okay and then here m minus 1 k minus 1

403
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,680
will be based on n minus 2

404
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,440
k minus 2

405
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,440
and n minus 2

406
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,800
k minus

407
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,680
k minus 1

408
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,120
yeah

409
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,000
and minus 1

410
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,759
k will be based on n minus two

411
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,839
k minus one

412
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:49,040
and minus two

413
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:52,720
k right so do we see any repeated value

414
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:55,199
here look we see this repeating

415
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,560
we've seen this repeated n minus two k

416
00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:00,959
minus one right and minus n minus two k

417
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:03,120
minus zero on this is like the binary

418
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:05,519
tree on the right

419
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:09,120
the final tree the last three

420
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,880
k doesn't uh k change by one decrement

421
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,000
by one on the right tree

422
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:17,040
k not changing so look n minus one k

423
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,000
minus one this will be n minus two

424
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:22,560
uh n minus two k minus one okay so look

425
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,120
we are we have this

426
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,759
overlapping sub problems

427
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,240
so it means that we can put a cache here

428
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:32,800
to save to speed up right so in that

429
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:36,959
case with the maximum stage we are

430
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:39,920
calculating is n times k right because

431
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:42,320
their n n will be from one

432
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,040
to n minus one

433
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,920
k

434
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:48,480
will be from zero to uh yeah yeah from

435
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,000
one to k minus one so n times k okay so

436
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,800
that's the very important thing today

437
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,560
okay it looks it looks like

438
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,759
similar to fibonacci number right yeah

439
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,870
okay that's it

440
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,260
all right

441
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:04,789
[Applause]

442
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:04,789
[Music]

443
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,919
you
