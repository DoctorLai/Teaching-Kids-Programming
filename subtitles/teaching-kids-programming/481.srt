1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
we have two strings s and t we have some

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,440
lowercase letters in s and we want to

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,840
find out how many copies of t can we

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,800
make by using the letters in

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,840
s

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,080
we can rearrange the s okay

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:20,480
so two copies yeah because look we have

8
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:23,359
two e's to us two eyes two c's two us

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,240
okay look two ass here right this is two

10
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,920
are coming from here two who are okay

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,279
for us okay

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,439
and

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,439
a and ryan okay

14
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,719
okay so we can easily map it

15
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,800
yeah so two copies

16
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:48,160
okay how do we solve this problem what's

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,840
your thoughts every grind anybody

18
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,840
um

19
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,440
you can counter what do we do using the

20
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,840
counter for we can use the

21
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,320
dictionary yes indication we can use the

22
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,520
counter in person so what are we

23
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,680
counting

24
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,039
we're counting

25
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,799
the number of

26
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,479
of the

27
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,479
number of tests let's say the number of

28
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,799
letters exactly okay so for example if

29
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,400
like we have we want to construct the t

30
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,119
t equals area

31
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,360
for simplicity eic

32
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,680
and then if we use the counter e will be

33
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,479
1 times r will be 1 times i would be 1

34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,799
times c will be one time and if we count

35
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:28,960
we do the same for the counter s

36
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:32,159
so if the s counter if e two times r has

37
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,400
three times i have two times c has three

38
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,479
times so how many copies can you get

39
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,720
three two okay

40
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,759
and if i is only one and how many how

41
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:44,880
many times copied one yeah why is that

42
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,200
because there's only one r and

43
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,920
it is two that

44
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,399
there's no another r yeah exactly so we

45
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,119
always aim for the minimum right so the

46
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:57,280
minimum the smallest number of uh

47
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,520
letters the frequency determines the

48
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,240
number of copies exactly so we can just

49
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,759
use the counter okay we can also yeah we

50
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,360
can also use the two force but blue

51
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,759
force is not very straightforward in

52
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,160
this case so basically how do you

53
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,360
propose we go through the letters in the

54
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,800
t

55
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,959
if this is e then we remove the e

56
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,160
in one copy of e

57
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,800
ah we do

58
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,440
r i we remove one eye

59
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,720
etc if we can finish the removing the

60
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,200
letters in s after going to the

61
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,160
one copy of t then we have one copy and

62
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,200
keep going in this way we can find out

63
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,480
the

64
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,560
number of copies we can make okay the

65
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,920
most efficient solution will be using

66
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,239
the counter we're using the counter

67
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,200
object right counter default dictionary

68
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,879
we'll go through the uh letters we think

69
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,360
of the letters by

70
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,599
uh by two string and then we update the

71
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,440
frequency but we we can also use the

72
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:57,440
counter right so using the content will

73
00:02:53,440 --> 00:03:01,440
be easier so how do we use the counter

74
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:04,159
s equals counter bigger axis

75
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,840
t equals counter so we have these two

76
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,879
counter things

77
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:12,159
right so now we just have to find out

78
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:13,920
the minimum right so for example if e

79
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:17,920
the t

80
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,920
in t the e letter is has two times and

81
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,000
the s in s

82
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,480
okay listen in s but what if the

83
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,640
target's not in the string

84
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,120
the target that's a very good question

85
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,200
when the target is not in a string yeah

86
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,120
yeah that's very good point so we can't

87
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,799
make a copy any copy that would be zero

88
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,480
right so but

89
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:40,879
that's a that's a very good point so

90
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:44,000
look this if e two times here and in s

91
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:47,040
the only this is uh s yeah this is s

92
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,400
this is the target

93
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,200
eight times

94
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,159
so how many copies can we make

95
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,959
if there are eight times of e in s

96
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,319
anybody two times of e

97
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,080
in the target

98
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,080
so how many copies can we make

99
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,360
four yeah exactly okay so ryan you

100
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,720
mentioned about if there's no such in

101
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,200
the s

102
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,159
so if if this is zero so how many how

103
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,159
many copies can i make

104
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,919
okay so we we need to go through the t

105
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,080
and then we find

106
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:25,120
the corresponding counter and we divide

107
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,120
it by it

108
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,759
and i don't get the minimum right for

109
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,759
example this e is eight times okay

110
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:35,759
and how about r

111
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:38,240
i released two times and then here r is

112
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,240
one time so how many copies can we make

113
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,720
look

114
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,280
in the s we got a times of e and two

115
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,680
times r in the t we've got the two times

116
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,759
of e and one times r so how many copies

117
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,360
can we make

118
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,890
how many copies

119
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,919
uh

120
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:56,240
[Music]

121
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:59,440
two two times exactly because look two

122
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:02,160
divided by one two a divided by two four

123
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,960
we we get the minimum right yeah exactly

124
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,639
okay so we can just do this return

125
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,520
mean

126
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,320
s

127
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,199
i

128
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,520
divided by t i

129
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:16,080
okay so we use the double division here

130
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,560
double divide this is to get the integer

131
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,880
part which is the floor look this flow 3

132
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,919
divided by 2

133
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,000
so 1.5 look this is flowing okay look

134
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:27,680
this is for this is ceiling

135
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,199
we still remember

136
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,039
ceiling

137
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:34,400
floor ceiling

138
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:37,759
if we 1.5 we get a floor that equals to

139
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,039
one 1.5 ceiling that'll be two

140
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,039
yeah

141
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,199
1.5 here

142
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,880
look 1.5 here

143
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,800
floor one

144
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,440
ceiling two

145
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,440
using this notation okay so look

146
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,000
double divide is to

147
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,560
actually the same as the fraud so we

148
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,280
want to get a minimum of s i divided by

149
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,160
i

150
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,960
for

151
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,080
i

152
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,199
in

153
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,600
t dot key okay t dot k

154
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:09,120
so we want to go through the letters in

155
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:11,120
t and we find out the corresponding

156
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,319
s i divided by t and we want to get a

157
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,400
minimum

158
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:17,680
that should be the answer alternatively

159
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,680
we can do this answer

160
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:24,720
infinity then we go through and then we

161
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:26,080
get a get a copy of each one so for i in

162
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:31,039
t

163
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:32,479
and an answer equals mean answer

164
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,560
s i

165
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,479
divided by t i

166
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,560
this is also okay

167
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,479
written answer okay

168
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,199
so basically this line

169
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:45,280
this is the one thing if you don't want

170
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,919
to write this one and you can use this

171
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,520
answer equals master infinity and goes

172
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:52,319
to the key t

173
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,960
for t for i in t dot keys is actually

174
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:58,240
the same as for i and t okay

175
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,880
e answer equals max s i divided by t i

176
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,960
get the floor for par

177
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,960
okay the size of the

178
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:08,319
string s is n

179
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:10,479
the size of a string t is n

180
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:13,199
so basically we need to go through two

181
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:15,440
twice uh one time here one time here

182
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:18,400
okay so the time converter position oh n

183
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,759
plus m the space complexity would be o n

184
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,800
plus n because we're using the two

185
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,800
counters

186
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,000
yeah any questions so far

187
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,680
no

188
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,160
what have you learned today the last

189
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,479
question always about

190
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,000
how to rearrange characters to make

191
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,160
target string

192
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,759
yeah so we have two strings yeah

193
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,639
and then how do we

194
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,240
find out the question is that we have

195
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,319
two strings and we want to find out how

196
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,039
many copies of t can we make by using

197
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:47,840
the letters in s okay and

198
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:50,720
what's the solution how many how many

199
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,960
accurate can you

200
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:57,039
do yeah and

201
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,479
how about the profiles how do we propose

202
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,039
check

203
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:03,120
we go through the letters in t we remove

204
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,440
each letter from the s and then we can

205
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,680
see how many like how many copies can we

206
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,759
make by removing and then we rub out

207
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,440
yeah yeah exactly and by using the

208
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,520
counter we just basically counting the

209
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:17,199
letters in both strings

210
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:19,520
and the number of copy is determined by

211
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,599
x i divided by t i

212
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,639
right that's very obvious the smallest

213
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,479
one right

214
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,720
the smallest yeah

215
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,400
okay the time space complexities oppose

216
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:32,840
o n plus then

217
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,840
okay that's it for today good job bye
