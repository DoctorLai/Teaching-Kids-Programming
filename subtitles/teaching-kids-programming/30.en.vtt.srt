talk uh
easy okay easy simple mathematics

16
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:28,720
easy okay easy simple mathematics

uh problem which is called buying cars

18
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:30,960
uh problem which is called buying cars
 

19
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,549
uh problem which is called buying cars
if we have a

20
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:32,559
if we have a
 

21
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:35,990
if we have a
uh list of prices for each car and

22
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:36,000
uh list of prices for each car and
 

23
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,950
uh list of prices for each car and
and the budget let's let's calculate how

24
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:38,960
and the budget let's let's calculate how
 

25
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:39,830
and the budget let's let's calculate how
many

26
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:39,840
many
 

27
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,990
many
maximum number of cars we can get for

28
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:42,000
maximum number of cars we can get for
 

29
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,110
maximum number of cars we can get for
example like

30
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:43,120
example like
 

31
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,270
example like
10 pasta 5 20

32
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:47,280
10 pasta 5 20
 

33
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,389
10 pasta 5 20
40 35 and even our budget

34
00:00:50,389 --> 00:00:50,399
40 35 and even our budget
 

35
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,950
40 35 and even our budget
is 35 so how many cars can we get

36
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:54,960
is 35 so how many cars can we get
 

37
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,910
is 35 so how many cars can we get
how many cars do we get for okay this is

38
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:57,920
how many cars do we get for okay this is
 

39
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,029
how many cars do we get for okay this is
the list of prices

40
00:01:01,029 --> 00:01:01,039

 

41
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,390

why is this three because you look at

42
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:04,400
why is this three because you look at
 

43
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,510
why is this three because you look at
the smallest number then add it by the

44
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:07,520
the smallest number then add it by the
 

45
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:07,990
the smallest number then add it by the
next

46
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:08,000
next
 

47
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,469
next
more than another fifteen and next with

48
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:10,479
more than another fifteen and next with
 

49
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:11,750
more than another fifteen and next with
numbers

50
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:11,760
numbers
 

51
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,390
numbers
and what does that make 35. okay 35 okay

52
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:16,400
and what does that make 35. okay 35 okay
 

53
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,830
and what does that make 35. okay 35 okay
so how does it work i mean uh what's the

54
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:19,840
so how does it work i mean uh what's the
 

55
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,510
so how does it work i mean uh what's the
raise okay okay so you're right your

56
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:23,520
raise okay okay so you're right your
 

57
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,590
raise okay okay so you're right your
strategy is to

58
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:25,600
strategy is to
 

59
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,910
strategy is to
pick the smallest first and then the

60
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:27,920
pick the smallest first and then the
 

61
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,710
pick the smallest first and then the
next morning

62
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:28,720
next morning
 

63
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,950
next morning
and the next smallest and here the

64
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:30,960
and the next smallest and here the
 

65
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,950
and the next smallest and here the
amount of the

66
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:32,960
amount of the
 

67
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,990
amount of the
money we spend is bigger than a budget

68
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:36,000
money we spend is bigger than a budget
 

69
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,910
money we spend is bigger than a budget
right okay so let's let's define a

70
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:39,920
right okay so let's let's define a
 

71
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,870
right okay so let's let's define a
function

72
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:40,880
function
 

73
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,149
function
defined by

74
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:44,159
defined by
 

75
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,230
defined by
cost project uh budget yes

76
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:48,240
cost project uh budget yes
 

77
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,510
cost project uh budget yes
yes and prices

78
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:51,520
yes and prices
 

79
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,550
yes and prices
yeah so what do we do at the beginning

80
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:56,560
yeah so what do we do at the beginning
 

81
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,830
yeah so what do we do at the beginning
what would you do we need to

82
00:01:59,830 --> 00:01:59,840
what would you do we need to
 

83
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,630
what would you do we need to
make the prices from the smallest so

84
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:04,640

 

85
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,870

to the piggies yeah so in order to know

86
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:06,880
to the piggies yeah so in order to know
 

87
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,430
to the piggies yeah so in order to know
what we can do

88
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:09,440
what we can do
 

89
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,990
what we can do
is to salt it yeah salt salt

90
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:16,000

 

91
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,070

and and then we salt it so these numbers

92
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:20,080
and and then we salt it so these numbers
 

93
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,270
and and then we salt it so these numbers
are increasing like

94
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:21,280
are increasing like
 

95
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,470
are increasing like
two three five seven yeah right this

96
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:24,480
two three five seven yeah right this
 

97
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,790
two three five seven yeah right this
kind of thing yeah yeah

98
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:26,800
kind of thing yeah yeah
 

99
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,150
kind of thing yeah yeah
okay that is 30 then we have a budget

100
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,160
okay that is 30 then we have a budget
 

101
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,190
okay that is 30 then we have a budget
budget then we need to do what we need

102
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:33,200
budget then we need to do what we need
 

103
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:33,990
budget then we need to do what we need
to have a

104
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:34,000
to have a
 

105
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,390
to have a
current amount of money right spend

106
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:36,400
current amount of money right spend
 

107
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,030
current amount of money right spend
let's call it spend

108
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,040
let's call it spend
 

109
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,350
let's call it spend
at the beginning we spend nothing yellow

110
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:41,360
at the beginning we spend nothing yellow
 

111
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,470
at the beginning we spend nothing yellow
right

112
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:42,480
right
 

113
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,509
right
yes now we need to go through the prices

114
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:45,519
yes now we need to go through the prices
 

115
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:45,910

129
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,509
number
we call it answer okay answer equals

130
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:07,519
we call it answer okay answer equals
 

131
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,350
we call it answer okay answer equals
zero and at the beginning we have

zero and at the beginning we have
purchasing zero number of cards plus is

134
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:12,080
purchasing zero number of cards plus is
 

135
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,030
purchasing zero number of cards plus is
nothing

173
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,350
right
we can purchase car so what do we do if

174
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:11,360
we can purchase car so what do we do if
 

175
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,869
we can purchase car so what do we do if
we want to purchase the car

176
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:12,879
we want to purchase the car
 

177
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,550
we want to purchase the car
we first of all we reduce the budget

178
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:16,560
we first of all we reduce the budget
 

179
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,310
we first of all we reduce the budget
yeah reduce the budget yeah by car

180
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:20,320
yeah reduce the budget yeah by car
 

181
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,230
yeah reduce the budget yeah by car
and then we increase the number we

182
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:22,240
and then we increase the number we
 

183
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,150
and then we increase the number we
already yeah

184
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:24,160
already yeah
 

185
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,550
already yeah
purchase one more car if it's smaller

186
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:26,560
purchase one more car if it's smaller
 

187
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,550
purchase one more car if it's smaller
than a budget it means that we can't

188
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:28,560
than a budget it means that we can't
 

189
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,469
than a budget it means that we can't
purchase any more car right

190
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:30,479
purchase any more car right
 

191
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,590
purchase any more car right
yeah now we just return break break you

192
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:33,600
yeah now we just return break break you
 

193
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,830
yeah now we just return break break you
know the break break the loop

194
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:35,840
know the break break the loop
 

195
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,510
know the break break the loop
so it exits the loop and we return

196
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:39,520
so it exits the loop and we return
 

197
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,550
so it exits the loop and we return
answer so we don't need this we don't

198
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:42,560
answer so we don't need this we don't
 

199
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,430
answer so we don't need this we don't
need this spent

200
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:43,440
need this spent
 

201
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,469
need this spent
okay so answer so this is the number of

202
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:46,479
okay so answer so this is the number of
 

203
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:47,830
okay so answer so this is the number of
cars

204
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:47,840
cars
 

205
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,230
cars
look look ryan what are you doing

can i have it please okay so look

212
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:07,600
can i have it please okay so look
 

213
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,510
can i have it please okay so look
let's let's say we have a hundred budget

214
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:11,520
let's let's say we have a hundred budget
 

215
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,310
let's let's say we have a hundred budget
budget equal hundred and then a cost

216
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:14,320
budget equal hundred and then a cost
 

217
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:14,870
budget equal hundred and then a cost
like uh

218
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:14,880
like uh
 

219
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,629
like uh
20 40 30

220
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:18,639
20 40 30
 

221
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,830
20 40 30
50 and 90. okay so can you tell me how

222
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:21,840
50 and 90. okay so can you tell me how
 

223
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,990
50 and 90. okay so can you tell me how
to do it price the salt then you

224
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,000
to do it price the salt then you
 

225
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,110
to do it price the salt then you
the price will become 20 30

226
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:27,120
the price will become 20 30
 

227
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,350
the price will become 20 30
40 50 and 90 yeah yeah yeah

228
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:31,360
40 50 and 90 yeah yeah yeah
 

229
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,510
40 50 and 90 yeah yeah yeah
look after this price to solve and the

230
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:33,520
look after this price to solve and the
 

231
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,270
look after this price to solve and the
price will become easier

232
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:35,280
price will become easier
 

233
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,029
price will become easier
okay this one is look and then

234
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:39,039
okay this one is look and then
 

235
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,070
okay this one is look and then
look and then we try for car in prices

236
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:42,080
look and then we try for car in prices
 

237
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:42,950
look and then we try for car in prices
so about 20

238
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:42,960
so about 20
 

239
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,469
so about 20
yeah it is budget 100 bigger than 20

240
00:05:46,469 --> 00:05:46,479
yeah it is budget 100 bigger than 20
 

241
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,830
yeah it is budget 100 bigger than 20
yes yes and budget equipment by 20.

242
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:49,840
yes yes and budget equipment by 20.
 

243
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,950
yes yes and budget equipment by 20.
so budget is 280 and then answer is one

244
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:52,960
so budget is 280 and then answer is one
 

245
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,990
so budget is 280 and then answer is one
okay and then now 30 is faster than 80

246
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:56,000
okay and then now 30 is faster than 80
 

247
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,830
okay and then now 30 is faster than 80
then 30

248
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:57,840
then 30
 

249
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,830
then 30
yes yes that will become 50 and then

250
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:01,840
yes yes that will become 50 and then
 

251
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,230
yes yes that will become 50 and then
this will become one one more yeah

252
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:04,240
this will become one one more yeah
 

253
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,430
this will become one one more yeah
okay move next is 50 bigger than

254
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:07,440
okay move next is 50 bigger than
 

255
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,629
okay move next is 50 bigger than
40 yes yes plus one

256
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:10,639
40 yes yes plus one
 

257
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,029
40 yes yes plus one
and then this 50 minus 40 that will

258
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:13,039
and then this 50 minus 40 that will
 

259
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:13,749
and then this 50 minus 40 that will
become

260
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:13,759
become
 

261
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,950
become
10. okay is 10 bigger than 50

262
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:16,960
10. okay is 10 bigger than 50
 

263
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,390
10. okay is 10 bigger than 50
no no then i break so let's

264
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:20,400
no no then i break so let's
 

265
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,870
no no then i break so let's
break and break this loop this great

266
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:22,880
break and break this loop this great
 

267
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,510
break and break this loop this great
keyword

268
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:23,520
keyword
 

269
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,790
keyword
is to exit the for loop now

270
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:26,800
is to exit the for loop now
 

271
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,950
is to exit the for loop now
so without going any further so let's

272
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:28,960
so without going any further so let's
 

273
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,830
so without going any further so let's
break

274
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:29,840
break
 

275
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,629
break
yeah break so let's break and then we

276
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:32,639
yeah break so let's break and then we
 

277
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,550
yeah break so let's break and then we
return answer which is three

278
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:34,560
return answer which is three
 

279
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,590
return answer which is three
yes break is breaking and can you tell

280
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:37,600
yes break is breaking and can you tell
 

281
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,590
yes break is breaking and can you tell
me what's next continue

282
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:39,600
me what's next continue
 

283
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,749
me what's next continue
what continue mean this is a pen

284
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:41,759
what continue mean this is a pen
 

285
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:42,790
what continue mean this is a pen
continue means

286
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:42,800
continue means
 

287
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,909
continue means
okay keep on going to the next one

288
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:45,919
okay keep on going to the next one
 

289
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,029
okay keep on going to the next one
yeah we allow without if they loop

290
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:49,039
yeah we allow without if they loop
 

291
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,629
yeah we allow without if they loop
there's still something at the end but

292
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:50,639
there's still something at the end but
 

293
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,110
there's still something at the end but
we're keeping we skipping the

294
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:53,120
we're keeping we skipping the
 

295
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,589
we're keeping we skipping the
rest of the loop and continue to let

296
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:55,599
rest of the loop and continue to let
 

297
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,110
rest of the loop and continue to let
next loop okay

298
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:57,120
next loop okay
 

299
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:14,390
next loop okay
okay so can you tell me the complexity

300
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:14,400

 

301
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,510

n is the number of prices

302
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:17,520
n is the number of prices
 

303
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,550
n is the number of prices
okay number of cars so what's the what

304
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:20,560
okay number of cars so what's the what
 

305
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,589
okay number of cars so what's the what
what are we doing here uh

306
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:23,599
what are we doing here uh
 

307
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,790
what are we doing here uh
we're adding yeah all of them

308
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:26,800
we're adding yeah all of them
 

309
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,790
we're adding yeah all of them
not all right so we need to in the worst

310
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:28,800
not all right so we need to in the worst
 

311
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,629
not all right so we need to in the worst
case no in the worst case

312
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:32,639
case no in the worst case
 

313
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,029
case no in the worst case
so there are 10 cars if i have a million

314
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:35,039
so there are 10 cars if i have a million
 

315
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:35,749
so there are 10 cars if i have a million
dollars

316
00:07:35,749 --> 00:07:35,759
dollars
 

317
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,469
dollars
then i i can have a million class right

318
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:38,479
then i i can have a million class right
 

319
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,309
then i i can have a million class right
yeah i know i can have all the cars

320
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:40,319
yeah i know i can have all the cars
 

321
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:40,629
yeah i know i can have all the cars
right

322
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:40,639
right
 

323
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,430
right
yeah so in the worst case that would be

324
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:43,440
yeah so in the worst case that would be
 

325
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,390
yeah so in the worst case that would be
if there is

326
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:44,400
if there is
 

327
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,029
if there is
a cheat like that yeah yeah in the worst

328
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:47,039
a cheat like that yeah yeah in the worst
 

329
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,469
a cheat like that yeah yeah in the worst
case

330
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:48,479
case
 

331
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,070
case
so it's this part is o-n right

332
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,080
so it's this part is o-n right
 

333
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,230
so it's this part is o-n right
this part is on because in the worst

334
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:54,240
this part is on because in the worst
 

335
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,070
this part is on because in the worst
case you need to go into

336
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:56,080
case you need to go into
 

337
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,510
case you need to go into
each of the car right but here remember

338
00:07:59,510 --> 00:07:59,520
each of the car right but here remember
 

339
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,110
each of the car right but here remember
here is the salting

340
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:01,120
here is the salting
 

341
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,230
here is the salting
yeah when we talk about salting is o

342
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:04,240
yeah when we talk about salting is o
 

343
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,189
yeah when we talk about salting is o
and log n okay so look this is a

344
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:09,199
and log n okay so look this is a
 

345
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,950
and log n okay so look this is a
good example of the so okay so this

346
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:12,960
good example of the so okay so this
 

347
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,350
good example of the so okay so this
is a algorithm but first part we need to

348
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:15,360
is a algorithm but first part we need to
 

349
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,749
is a algorithm but first part we need to
sort it which is o and log n

350
00:08:17,749 --> 00:08:17,759
sort it which is o and log n
 

351
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,430
sort it which is o and log n
and now the second part we need to go

352
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:19,440
and now the second part we need to go
 

353
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,150
and now the second part we need to go
through each class to check if it's o

354
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:22,160
through each class to check if it's o
 

355
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,510
through each class to check if it's o
so what's the complexity

356
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:27,520
so what's the complexity
 

357
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,270
so what's the complexity
why yes it's always look at why

358
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:31,280
why yes it's always look at why
 

359
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,350
why yes it's always look at why
why is not o n because

360
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:35,360
why is not o n because
 

361
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,110
why is not o n because
this part is more dominant yeah yeah

362
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:39,120
this part is more dominant yeah yeah
 

363
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,550
this part is more dominant yeah yeah
so look if there is if the complexity is

364
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:42,560
so look if there is if the complexity is
 

365
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,670
so look if there is if the complexity is
o n log n plus plus

366
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:45,680
o n log n plus plus
 

367
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,790
o n log n plus plus
n right yeah we only keep

368
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:48,800
n right yeah we only keep
 

369
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,190
n right yeah we only keep
look we only keep the most important

370
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:51,200
look we only keep the most important
 

371
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,030
look we only keep the most important
part this is dominant

372
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,040
part this is dominant
 

373
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,350
part this is dominant
because this is more complex than this

374
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:55,360
because this is more complex than this
 

375
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,150
because this is more complex than this
part yeah

376
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:56,160
part yeah
 

377
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,870
part yeah
yeah so we can skip this part yeah

378
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:58,880
yeah so we can skip this part yeah
 

379
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,710
yeah so we can skip this part yeah
because this is more important

380
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:00,720
because this is more important
 

381
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,150
because this is more important
more complex time consuming than n right

382
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:04,160
more complex time consuming than n right
 

383
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,389
more complex time consuming than n right
together how about if i write another

384
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:06,399
together how about if i write another
 

385
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,870
together how about if i write another
one o n squared plus

386
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:08,880
one o n squared plus
 

387
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,269
one o n squared plus
n log n so what what can this be

388
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:11,279
n log n so what what can this be
 

389
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,750
n log n so what what can this be
simplified

390
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:14,760

 

391
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,030

[Music]

392
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:17,040
[Music]
 

393
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,829
[Music]
so what's the answer of this what's the

394
00:09:20,829 --> 00:09:20,839
so what's the answer of this what's the
 

395
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:26,150
so what's the answer of this what's the
complexity

396
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,160

 

397
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:31,110

o n squared which is bigger

398
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:31,120

 

399
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,829

one square is n times n and this n times

400
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:33,839
one square is n times n and this n times
 

401
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:34,230
one square is n times n and this n times
log

402
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:34,240
log
 

403
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,750
log
n n is bigger than log n right

404
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:37,760
n n is bigger than log n right
 

405
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,430
n n is bigger than log n right
yes so o n square is bigger than z

406
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:41,440
yes so o n square is bigger than z
 

407
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,230
yes so o n square is bigger than z
so we remove the long the trivial path

408
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:44,240
so we remove the long the trivial path
 

409
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,750
so we remove the long the trivial path
so like dominating

410
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:45,760
so like dominating
 

411
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,790
so like dominating
complexities of n squared do you get it

412
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:48,800
complexities of n squared do you get it
 

413
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,829
complexities of n squared do you get it
yes how about o n

414
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:51,839
yes how about o n
 

415
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,750
yes how about o n
cubic plus n square so what's this

416
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:55,760
cubic plus n square so what's this
 

417
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,949
cubic plus n square so what's this
what can this be what's the what's the

418
00:09:58,949 --> 00:09:58,959
what can this be what's the what's the
 

419
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,470
what can this be what's the what's the
complexity of that

420
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:02,480

 

421
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,829

o and cubic plus n square cubic

422
00:10:05,829 --> 00:10:05,839
o and cubic plus n square cubic
 

423
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,630
o and cubic plus n square cubic
yeah yeah because this is dominating so

424
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:08,640
yeah yeah because this is dominating so
 

425
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,910
yeah yeah because this is dominating so
this is trivial part

426
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:09,920
this is trivial part
 

427
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,790
this is trivial part
yeah so we don't consider this you know

428
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:12,800
yeah so we don't consider this you know
 

429
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,630
yeah so we don't consider this you know
when we talk about complexity we

430
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:14,640
when we talk about complexity we
 

431
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,509
when we talk about complexity we
talk about the most time consuming

432
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:17,519
talk about the most time consuming
 

433
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,069
talk about the most time consuming
component

434
00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:18,079
component
 

435
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,389
component
of the aggregate this acronym contains

436
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:20,399
of the aggregate this acronym contains
 

437
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,670
of the aggregate this acronym contains
stock two parts

438
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:21,680
stock two parts
 

439
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,230
stock two parts
sorting the prices number of cars and

440
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:24,240
sorting the prices number of cars and
 

441
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,230
sorting the prices number of cars and
then going through each car

442
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:26,240
then going through each car
 

443
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,470
then going through each car
to check if they are still budget to buy

444
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:28,480
to check if they are still budget to buy
 

445
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,750
to check if they are still budget to buy
it right yeah

446
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:29,760
it right yeah
 

447
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,670
it right yeah
okay so there are two parts which which

448
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:31,680
okay so there are two parts which which
 

449
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,910
okay so there are two parts which which
part is most dominating is the sorting

450
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:33,920
part is most dominating is the sorting
 

451
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,630
part is most dominating is the sorting
part

452
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:34,640
part
 

453
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,949
part
so the complexity is this part which is

454
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:36,959
so the complexity is this part which is
 

455
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,550
so the complexity is this part which is
o and log n

456
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:38,560
o and log n
 

457
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,230
o and log n
got it okay the last part say goodbye

458
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:42,240
got it okay the last part say goodbye
 

459
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,550
got it okay the last part say goodbye
bye bye bye

460
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:46,560
bye bye bye
 

461
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,399
bye bye bye
oh yeah
