1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,320
go

2
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:05,600
hi

3
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:08,000
hello mr erin is right okay

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:11,360
okay i'm going to write a few rules to

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,400
make up a word okay let's say

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,599
ah

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,199
the legs of r r to i

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,359
it means that

9
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:22,800
the letter

10
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,800
followed by r is i okay

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,960
e

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,880
eric

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:31,640
oh you're getting this i know i'm not

14
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,640
finished yet because i can see

15
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,960
so we have given the list of we are

16
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,440
given a list of these rules and they

17
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,360
need to return the word lieutenant

18
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,120
and also

19
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,280
impossible

20
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,719
it's it's valid okay whatever it is in

21
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,920
the word

22
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:02,000
good yeah but

23
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,520
the the thing is it's always valid okay

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,199
it's always ready so

25
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,360
and the word doesn't contain the

26
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:10,240
duplicate letters okay if you if you

27
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,000
give a dad right

28
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,159
it doesn't have these yeah it doesn't

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,840
have these it doesn't have cycles here

30
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,840
it doesn't have pointing back because

31
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,200
look if you put this d

32
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,360
to a

33
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,920
i a to d okay

34
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,680
so we don't have the inputs for this so

35
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,799
all the letters

36
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,200
in the world is unique yeah unique my

37
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,640
first word

38
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,560
that's what i'm saying there's no

39
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,420
there's no unique there's no duplicate

40
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,560
letters okay

41
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,799
[Music]

42
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,640
yeah

43
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,720
if it is then

44
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,079
there's no way to use the angle then

45
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,640
there's no way to do it because there

46
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:49,280
could be there could be a

47
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,600
a different the the result would not be

48
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,360
unique right even though if there's a

49
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,399
duplicate numbers then there could be

50
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,479
different results okay correct

51
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,079
okay let's try again okay i'm not going

52
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,280
to write the ryan this time okay just

53
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,280
guess okay

54
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,520
let's guess

55
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,399
p to

56
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,399
a

57
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,399
okay

58
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,400
they speak spanish

59
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,440
okay s to b that [ __ ] s to p

60
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,000
a to i i to n

61
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,800
uh p to a okay so you got it yeah

62
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,480
okay so given these rules

63
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,680
given these twos we

64
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,599
we want to

65
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,680
restore we want to

66
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:45,120
cut the original one okay is it clear

67
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,959
yeah

68
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,519
any idea

69
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,040
any idea how do we do this

70
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,360
how do i do it

71
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,720
from these news what what can we get

72
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:59,360
what can we learn from these news

73
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,680
what can we learn from these these rules

74
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,680
connect to each other next to each other

75
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:08,560
and apart from that what can we learn

76
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:10,879
like s p goes to so p was next p a yeah

77
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,440
what's next

78
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,280
yeah yeah yeah oh good so the first

79
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,959
thing of this is

80
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,959
what are you trying to do

81
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:22,720
yes you follow it but follow from where

82
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,920
good that's a very good starting point

83
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,920
so where where to follow

84
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,640
you're following these yeah p to a a to

85
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,480
i i to n yeah because they lose so the

86
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,920
most important thing is to find out

87
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,480
which one

88
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,879
is the what

89
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,720
which one do we start start okay so

90
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,560
which one is the start

91
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,959
right okay there's one part missing so

92
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,680
we want to find the first letter

93
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,239
from these news how can we tell which

94
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,879
which letter is the question so we check

95
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:56,720
through all of them if the one who

96
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:59,439
only appears once is the one is

97
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:02,400
that yeah where's that yes good job yes

98
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:04,799
if it appears only once okay look

99
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,599
from s to a r

100
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,120
yeah

101
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,319
p to a all right

102
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,680
okay so look

103
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,280
for example this p

104
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,439
you got s to p

105
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,280
and you also have p to a right

106
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,400
but how about the last one the last one

107
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,799
i to n

108
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,000
oh yeah but that last one is also appear

109
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,560
once

110
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,639
hey almost there almost there nearly a

111
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,919
tray okay that's fine this one i

112
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:31,120
couldn't do later okay so is it wait i

113
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:34,240
got a question if if you do like stp

114
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:38,160
does s have to go fast

115
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:40,840
the key it means that p is next to s

116
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:45,199
okay it just means p is next to

117
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:47,520
s okay so look if you say appeal once n

118
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,960
and s appear only once so how can we

119
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:53,040
tell if it's

120
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,040
if s is in the first place

121
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,199
if s is the plus how do we know if n is

122
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,080
look

123
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:02,960
where's as s is in the first n is in the

124
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:06,080
last okay so we want to find out the

125
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:09,680
letter which appear only once

126
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:13,840
if we start from here it does this one

127
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,680
play like um like if it stp does p go

128
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,240
after s

129
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,919
yeah p go after s yes

130
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,199
p is next to x

131
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,720
okay

132
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,199
okay what you're doing what's your right

133
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,759
okay so you understand yeah so look

134
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,919
your solution is it's okay

135
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,479
there are only two letters s and n which

136
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:36,639
only appears in one yeah but we have to

137
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,639
distinguish between s and n so s

138
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:43,600
is the beginning and the last one yeah

139
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,680
so this look this is the in degree uh so

140
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,759
if we have this the p the in degree

141
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,000
right we call it in degree and then p to

142
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,880
a this is our degree so we want to find

143
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,800
a letter which doesn't have any indegree

144
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,479
right because it only

145
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,120
it doesn't have we don't have any

146
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,160
letters come going through the s right

147
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,319
okay

148
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,600
yeah and then we follow this s to p p to

149
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,600
a

150
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,600
i you know follow these okay

151
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,919
but you know if you don't yeah this is a

152
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,720
very uh efficient agreement but first of

153
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,520
all we uh if we don't have this if we

154
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,639
don't

155
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,160
uh

156
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,759
we don't have this uh efficient

157
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,840
algorithm we can always prove us how can

158
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,800
we move forward i'm just going to

159
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,639
say this idea proof of thing yeah

160
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,240
proof of thing we first first of all we

161
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,759
find the number of letters from these

162
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,960
rules yeah because we can find out the

163
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,800
letter which is a five s p i i i spam

164
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,440
right spend the five letters five

165
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,360
letters and we can proof of this

166
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,919
yeah this is the set we will compute

167
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,880
this in a set and now we prove forcing

168
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,479
it

169
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,080
using a different permutation and

170
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,000
remember computation one two three

171
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,000
permutation how many permutations are

172
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
these

173
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,840
permutations different orders how many

174
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,800
permutations six yeah one two three one

175
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,479
three two

176
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:00,880
two one three two three three two one

177
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,479
three one two three two one yeah because

178
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,479
you look at the first position you have

179
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,080
three letters three choice the second

180
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,000
partition you have two

181
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,080
right the second choice you have one so

182
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,560
three times two times one is six the

183
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,720
fourth communication if there are five

184
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,280
is five factorial right

185
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:20,319
so if i learn n letters if the rules

186
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,919
have n letters right so the complexities

187
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,720
o n factorial

188
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:27,120
once we have one factorial

189
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,840
o and factor this is the number of

190
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,440
possibility permutations their

191
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:34,479
permutation then we check we need to

192
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,080
check if it is the same rule of least if

193
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,400
it

194
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,560
if it satisfies all the rules right so

195
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,000
this needs to

196
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,639
do another o

197
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,520
n

198
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,840
right

199
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,919
o n right am right

200
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,759
yes you need to go through these rules

201
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,360
one by one

202
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,280
go through this loop

203
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,960
but how do you know doesn't really lose

204
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,960
and then you need to find how do you

205
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,360
check if it satisfies the rule right you

206
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,879
need to use this find

207
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,960
to find out

208
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,759
the number of the characters and then

209
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:08,560
it's next one so look if if we we have

210
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,639
this expand we need to find out the p

211
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,960
which is at this position and we have to

212
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:15,280
check its next one

213
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,000
if it's a now if it doesn't if it's not

214
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,000
a

215
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,160
then we return the force

216
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,240
it doesn't satisfy this rule right so

217
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,680
look we have to go through the end rules

218
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,680
for example the anus and for each

219
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,080
character we have to use the find or

220
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,879
index index to find out the

221
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,279
index of the

222
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,719
of this this character that a this

223
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:39,039
character p

224
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:40,479
in the permutation is another n so o n

225
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:43,599
bacteria

226
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:45,920
times n times n so this is

227
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,640
very very slow okay so we're not going

228
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,640
to

229
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,720
go uh implement this one but we can use

230
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,959
the it's a permutation yeah we can use

231
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,920
the word permutation

232
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:57,279
the the python yeah the python

233
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,920
has a

234
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:01,760
gita tool of permutation so what does it

235
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,839
mean

236
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:08,360
that's a slow

237
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,360
permutation so look we can fly

238
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,279
import

239
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,279
permutation we can use this

240
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,600
communication

241
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,920
yeah and then we can do that if these

242
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,160
letters even all the letters in a in a

243
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,279
set yeah if it's in a sense okay you

244
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,120
need to

245
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,519
calculate we need to process the rules

246
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,240
and put in a set and we can do this for

247
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,040
p

248
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,399
in

249
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:37,839
permutation permutation

250
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,839
permutation letters

251
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,399
okay now we can need to check if check p

252
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,640
if we need to check if

253
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,399
if satisfied all the rules yeah then

254
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,360
return p we can

255
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,959
return this permutation between p p p is

256
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,560
a two part okay it will return for

257
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,519
example if it's uh

258
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,760
s p

259
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,080
p a uh let's say eric you will return

260
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,760
this e

261
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,680
r

262
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:05,120
i

263
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,120
c okay we'll return this

264
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,880
[Music]

265
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,600
okay

266
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,200
okay so this is a twofold thing okay but

267
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,959
we're not going to go into the detail

268
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,480
with the check funny but you know what

269
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,480
we're going to check yeah we found first

270
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,160
of all we find out

271
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,880
we find out the index of the first

272
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:31,519
letter in the rule which is the we use

273
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:34,000
the index yeah we use the index to

274
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:36,399
index function will return

275
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,480
the index of first occurrence letter all

276
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,560
right and if it's a string if it's a

277
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,160
string or list we can also use the fine

278
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,200
the difference between the index and

279
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,560
finally is one the index shows raised

280
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,040
exception

281
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,440
if if the the thing you're looking for

282
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,720
does not exist in the list in october

283
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,360
but 5

284
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,760
would return minus 1 if it doesn't exist

285
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,160
and then index only

286
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,200
we can use the index method in for the

287
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,800
tuple but

288
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,720
we can't use the

289
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,800
uh find the method in the tube okay

290
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,680
that's one another difference okay

291
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,519
so

292
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,040
for we can implement the second one

293
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,959
right first of all we

294
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,040
we need to find out the first letter we

295
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,200
need to find out the first step okay

296
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,040
define let's say constructive

297
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,640
constructed reward we have constructed

298
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,680
word

299
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,360
and we have

300
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:27,519
we have a rules yeah we have a loose

301
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,279
so let's say

302
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,200
let's say we want to find out look we

303
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,600
will not have a little theta d theta

304
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,079
equals a set right

305
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,519
then we can do this for

306
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,640
do

307
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,079
in

308
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:44,399
lose okay

309
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:46,320
let's say the loose is like that e to i

310
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,079
e to r let

311
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,240
let's put it in a string okay into r

312
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,880
let's say e

313
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,959
e

314
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:56,240
bigger than r right that means the i is

315
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:57,680
next to e so we we first of all a b

316
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,800
equals

317
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,480
rule

318
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,760
does breaks

319
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:06,800
what's really mean split by this one

320
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,000
by the bigger equal so a is e b

321
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,040
okay

322
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,959
and now what we do

323
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,760
first of all we put all the letters in a

324
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:18,320
set right let's say data

325
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,320
dot at

326
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:24,560
this is a hashtag hashtag it will put a

327
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,800
in and then we also put a b in right we

328
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,720
also put a b in right

329
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,720
now the a

330
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,600
finally the data will contain what we

331
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,120
have is a set yeah it's a set of what

332
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,800
e

333
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,040
r

334
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,560
i

335
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,320
c okay

336
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,160
all right this this is the data set and

337
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,399
then now we need to go through the date

338
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,920
the rule again let's go through the loop

339
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,440
again and then let's take it what went

340
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,800
on okay

341
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:55,120
take one out at a time this is the same

342
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:59,120
a b equals do

343
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,120
the split this is the same okay

344
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,240
theta dot remover we want to remove this

345
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,440
one look

346
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,519
e to r

347
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,839
r to i

348
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:14,800
i to c

349
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:17,200
okay so we want to remove which one

350
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,920
theta doesn't move up

351
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:22,399
so we we have theta which is eic right

352
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,560
eic we already know eic in the data

353
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,000
there are four characters

354
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,600
and then now we go through the rule

355
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,760
again we want to remove

356
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,920
which key arrows

357
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,720
now we want to remove these or these

358
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,480
from the data so that we can get the

359
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,360
first characters

360
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,279
uh

361
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,519
we need to remove

362
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,959
this yes though we don't remove the b

363
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,839
yeah okay

364
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,000
look

365
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,760
with the move b yeah

366
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,920
and now the first letter is what the

367
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,440
current letter is first letter is one

368
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,440
this is a data it's a list and we

369
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,519
convert it to this

370
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,120
you contain only one characters because

371
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,000
we don't have duplicate numbers we only

372
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,560
have

373
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,399
uh unique numbers and then well the

374
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,440
first character the first depiction

375
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,880
there is only one element so ci cui is

376
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,480
the

377
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,399
is the first character and then we we

378
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,519
have we stole this answer here answer

379
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,600
equals this

380
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,760
uh answer it was cur because this is

381
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,760
first i know what we do

382
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,680
wire

383
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,680
c u r

384
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,000
okay so we we also need the mapping yeah

385
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,399
we also need to making from a to b yeah

386
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,639
so let's say the mapping and

387
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,440
this is a dictionary yeah i know we do

388
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,040
what

389
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,120
m a

390
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:36,480
equals b so we know

391
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,399
the next character of a is b okay so we

392
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,120
use a decision array look okay then we

393
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:43,519
look we current why this is current is

394
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,560
still in

395
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:48,639
in in mapping yeah look look

396
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,320
the last letter

397
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:54,079
the last letter does not have mapping

398
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:56,320
yeah because look e-i-c e-i-c

399
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:58,320
a c doesn't have a next letter right

400
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,040
every other letter has the next letter

401
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,120
the

402
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:06,480
m e equals r m r equals i m i equals c

403
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,480
so why we still not in the left next

404
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,720
letter for i

405
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,720
no no no no c doesn't have any letter

406
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,680
look it's from a to c c doesn't have

407
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,279
gold

408
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:19,519
if c goes nowhere okay so for current i

409
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,360
y r current in m means that we are not

410
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,360
reaching the last letter then we build

411
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,639
it we we need to answer

412
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:30,000
plus equal m current right

413
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:32,079
and then what current equals m current

414
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,959
right so we are moving to the next one

415
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,959
and return answer

416
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,839
okay

417
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,040
okay

418
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,600
you see

419
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,360
so the time complexity

420
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,240
we're going through the rules

421
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,000
one time two times still linear yeah

422
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,160
and then we'll go through the letters so

423
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,639
the time complexity will be o n right

424
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:55,040
because look ladies oh n is the number

425
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:58,160
of characters in the original in the

426
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,600
original world okay

427
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,680
yeah

428
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,800
okay yeah yeah sure

429
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:07,120
so look we're using a set yeah so data

430
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,519
first of all we put all the characters

431
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:12,160
in in there well this is this is called

432
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:14,240
characters in which you have eic and the

433
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:17,120
second second pass

434
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,519
we are removing the

435
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,360
the next yeah the next characters from

436
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:24,959
the set so

437
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:28,079
we remove r i c then i c so

438
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:30,079
what do we have left is e which is the

439
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,839
the first character now we start

440
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,920
building research in the character yeah

441
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,000
when we are not reaching the end of

442
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:39,680
character when the mapping

443
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,320
look and be sufficient area dictionary

444
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,720
m a equals b so we can use the key to

445
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,920
look for the next characters and then we

446
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,160
build it

447
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,399
and current is the next characters

448
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,720
and i'm removing the current variations

449
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,639
look if r i'm coming

450
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,360
and i put the answer

451
00:16:54,639 --> 00:17:00,079
i add this append this r to the answer

452
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,240
which is for example i and then i move

453
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,759
it to the next one which is i and i move

454
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,039
it to the next one i'll build it and the

455
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,360
wrong way

456
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:09,360
yeah let's return the answer

457
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,240
so we are using a set we can also using

458
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,120
the

459
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,439
what

460
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,600
mapping the dictionary yeah dictionary

461
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,640
remember the default uh decision area

462
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:20,079
from

463
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:22,720
from corrections input dictionaries and

464
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:24,799
we can do what we can theta

465
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,600
if it's additional we can tell the data

466
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,880
a

467
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:31,120
plus equals one and theta

468
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,360
b minus equals one okay so what does

469
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,679
this mean look let's take

470
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,360
this example eic for example okay and

471
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,200
then you know what i'm talking about

472
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:42,799
theta okay

473
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,640
theta a plus equals one so look e i c f

474
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:46,559
e i c

475
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,400
e r i

476
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:51,840
c

477
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:54,320
data we have these keys this is the keys

478
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,760
key and the value

479
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:59,919
so look

480
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:02,000
e to r so e will plus one r minus one

481
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:04,400
okay r to i

482
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,799
always plus one

483
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,400
i o minus one

484
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,400
i to c

485
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,280
i will plus one

486
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:16,080
c u n minus one okay so what do we have

487
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:18,240
all the intermediate characters yeah the

488
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:21,280
other intermediaries

489
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,320
they will be zero right yeah the first

490
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,320
letter

491
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,080
will be one this last letter will be

492
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,919
minus one right

493
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,080
so we just have to look through these

494
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:32,640
keys

495
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,400
we just have to loosen the keys

496
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,480
and find out the value which is bigger

497
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,400
than zero okay and we in this way in

498
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,720
this case we can find the first

499
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,720
character the last letter is my

500
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,160
negative yeah okay

501
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,919
makes sense

502
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,600
yeah and then

503
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,360
and then in this case we don't need to

504
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,520
go through the

505
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,440
these second iterations to remove it we

506
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,520
can only just go through one the rules

507
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,520
once right but still we still have to

508
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,600
keep this mapping you know we can we

509
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:03,280
need to keep the mapping and

510
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:04,480
