1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000

00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,469
[Music]

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,160
what's my list

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,260
so we're given an array of digits single

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:23,060
digit and they could be a duplicate

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,060
right it could be duplicate yes

7
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,580
yes and we want to find all three digits

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,180
and no leadings uniforms no leading

9
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:35,180
zeros okay

10
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:42,300
so we can't have like zero one two this

11
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:46,320
is not a good number right but we could

12
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:49,440
have one to zero to one zero and since

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,300
there are two two so we only keep one

14
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,700
copy of that which is two one zero Okay

15
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:58,440
so

16
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:58,440
we talk about it both of us yeah

17
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,739
how do you pull fast we talk about

18
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:08,299
permutation try to

19
00:01:03,739 --> 00:01:08,299
try to check everything

20
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:14,420
and I and then start from my

21
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:25,140
skip every odd number and check if it

22
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:27,960
can be even numbers and if it can be

23
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,580
made from the array excellent yes so

24
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,560
there are two ways of proof of one way

25
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:34,320
is because it's a three digit right so

26
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:39,960
we approvals try every even number from

27
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:44,460
100 to 998 yeah skip two so for I in

28
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:46,560
range 100 here 999 step two and once we

29
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:49,079
have this number for example one zero

30
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,200
two we come back to check if one zero

31
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:53,520
two can be made from a given digit at

32
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,140
least it's more efficient because there

33
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,759
are limited number of the three digit

34
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,000
numbers and we can just do this in

35
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:02,399
constant term

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,320
the other way our profile so it's using

37
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,840
the permutation because we have permuted

38
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,259
actually permutating three digits out of

39
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,180
these and digit okay we can prove us

40
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:15,060
these the whole number or we can prove

41
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:17,879
was each single digit right so let's say

42
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:23,099
ABC left this is the three digit number

43
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:25,140
so we can do this for a in range no

44
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:27,300
readings you know right because there's

45
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:31,220
no living zero so it's always one up to

46
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:33,239
ten right no readings you know

47
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:35,760
in French

48
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:37,500
the second digit it could be any from 0

49
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,940
to 9 right

50
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:43,800
for C in range the third number okay so

51
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:46,319
what's the third number the third number

52
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:49,140
has to be even digit

53
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,900
right because it has to be even number

54
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:56,220
so the third number would be from 0 to

55
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:58,440
10 step two right so zero two four six

56
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:01,080
eight this is what it means and then

57
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:04,500
once we have this IDC we check if

58
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,580
counter ABC is smaller than the this

59
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,739
counter

60
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:10,140
then we don't need to check a leading

61
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:11,640
dealer right because a cannot be it's

62
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:14,760
yellow well you don't need to check for

63
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:17,700
even numbers right because C

64
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,560
with step two right and then after that

65
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,780
then we can push this to the answer

66
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,599
which is eight times a hundred

67
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,099
eight times a hundred plus b times ten

68
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:29,519
plus

69
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:31,319
C okay do we need to solve this using

70
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,959
this uh kind of for Loop do we need to

71
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:36,900
solve these numbers not really because a

72
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:39,480
is one to ten yeah look at when the

73
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,640
numbers generated so a from the smallest

74
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,560
to the thickest B for the smallest to

75
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:46,019
the ticket C from the smallest to the

76
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,940
biggest right so this number generated

77
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:49,440
is also from the smallest to the

78
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:55,400
previous this is the same thing like

79
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:55,400
this for Loop for 100 to 998 step two

80
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:02,220
IPM free

81
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:04,379
picking three out of and with the

82
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:07,680
sequence cn3 is

83
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:10,140
taking three out of n with a the order

84
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,140
does not matter so pn3 is actually C and

85
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:14,580
three times the p33 okay this is the

86
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:17,340
full communication we're using the

87
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:19,199
default last lesson left as such and we

88
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:21,660
can use the pressure search but because

89
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,340
we are only picking three

90
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,800
all right well because we're only

91
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:27,900
picking three so we can also do this not

92
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,479
looping over the numbers we're looking

93
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:35,580
over the index if not n so we can say

94
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:40,979
for the first index is range and right

95
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:43,860
the second index for J in range n

96
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:48,000
Force the third index is also from when

97
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:50,040
uh we have to check if I equal equal J

98
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,840
then we continue we don't want a

99
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:55,620
duplicate Index right because each index

100
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:59,340
can only be picked once if I equal K or

101
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:01,919
J equal k then we continue we ignore it

102
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:04,800
right so and once we have the i j k we

103
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:06,840
can test if this number is an even

104
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,460
number without a leaving zero and then

105
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,919
if it is they will push it back to the

106
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:12,479
result but after this we need to solve

107
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:13,500
it right because we are just picking the

108
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,199
index

109
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:18,419
okay so definitely such I will use the

110
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:20,940
recursion and then once we pick it we

111
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:23,039
pick this number we follow it and we

112
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:25,979
need to keep it back right

113
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,880
now how do we implement the perfect

114
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:31,740
search

115
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,740
anybody perfect okay

116
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:41,520
first search because yeah

117
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:43,680
if and it's bigger than equal to 99. we

118
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,199
need to check if n is

119
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,880
uh even number and if it's a even number

120
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:54,539
we push this answer a pen

121
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:58,259
uh append answer copious is a set okay

122
00:05:54,539 --> 00:06:00,840
success answer for ADD

123
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:03,900
and another 10.

124
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:06,620
I know we need to go to each digit for I

125
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,620
in range

126
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:15,199
10 right and then if this frequency IF

127
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:18,120
frequency I is bigger than yellow

128
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,620
lands we follow it right we have enough

129
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,199
digit of I

130
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:26,340
we follow it

131
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:30,360
I minus equals one and then f as such so

132
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:33,000
current number is n so n times 10 plus I

133
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,800
okay after recursion we need to give it

134
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,380
back frequency

135
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,720
I plus equal one

136
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:42,660
and therefore such at the beginning we

137
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:45,120
start with zero and then return

138
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:50,699
sorted

139
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:53,280
salted answer right okay so this is the

140
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:54,960
ever such at the beginning the frequency

141
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:58,380
it needs to

142
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:01,940
be computed using this counter widget

143
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:04,860
this is deficit that stories

144
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:07,380
you said you use a q first in first

145
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:10,440
element okay first inverter so we push

146
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:12,419
the kids every time we take you we take

147
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:15,660
one from the left hand side pushes the

148
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:18,419
kid back to the cube okay so the clever

149
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:20,419
such level by level that was such as

150
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:22,860
steep as we can

151
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:26,580
which method current is that the first

152
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:29,340
solution we get is the optimum if we are

153
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:30,780
looking for the shortest purposes okay

154
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,699
but in this case it doesn't matter

155
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:34,860
because we are finding all the three

156
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:36,900
digits right we actually finding all the

157
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:38,039
three Institute even numbers so it

158
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,020
doesn't matter differences you

159
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:43,280
preferences we have to perform the

160
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:46,699
entire search using the default search

161
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:49,560
different order okay at the beginning

162
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:53,580
why we're using the set anybody

163
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:56,880
because we need to store London

164
00:07:53,580 --> 00:08:00,900
we don't want that duplicates yeah okay

165
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:03,060
set the unique things the numbers that's

166
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,979
right unique numbers so it doesn't store

167
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:07,500
duplicate like for example if it's

168
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:09,780
answer is at least it's a list of this

169
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:13,979
is this right answer the door open one

170
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:16,380
answer to open one another one right you

171
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:20,360
store three elements but answer if it's

172
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:20,360
a set answer dot append one

173
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,919
nothing changed because one is already

174
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,699
in the set nothing changed okay this is

175
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:31,699
the major difference

176
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,899
we can do this uh push and pop on both

177
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,599
sides PQ

178
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:42,479
we need to store the current number and

179
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,979
the digits right we need to install the

180
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,700
current number in the digit so the color

181
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:52,260
number is zero the digit is counter

182
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:54,779
count uh AR okay so this is a couple and

183
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:59,580
then wire Q

184
00:08:54,779 --> 00:09:01,500
so n f equal Q dot Pub left

185
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,600
taking from the left hand side kill the

186
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:08,220
problem and this is the current number f

187
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:10,620
is the remaining digit okay so here if n

188
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:13,080
is bigger or equal if bigger than 99

189
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:15,180
okay actually there okay so it's bigger

190
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:18,060
than 99 not equal okay three digit

191
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:21,080
figure 99 or bigger or equal to 100.

192
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:25,740
well if n is

193
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:27,240
odd number then answer add answer dot

194
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:30,000
add and

195
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:33,000
we tell here otherwise we need to go

196
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,440
through each digit for I in range

197
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,660
fan

198
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,399
so now we need to make a copy of the

199
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:41,220
counter right counter is the object so

200
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,240
counter let's say C equals copy dot d

201
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:45,600
copy

202
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:48,060
copy this is a package deep copy what's

203
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,220
the difference between deep copy and

204
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:51,959
Cheryl coffee

205
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:54,540
deep copies

206
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:57,980
what kind of deep is it I I think you

207
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,980
call it something like aliens

208
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:06,720
did copy what's the tip is clone okay a

209
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:09,360
equals one two three okay if I said P

210
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,240
equals a this is not deep copy because

211
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:15,480
if I said P zero I want to change it to

212
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,459
four so what happened here B will be

213
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:20,339
equal the first element to four right

214
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:23,100
four two three a is also changes to four

215
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:26,240
to three because b equals a b is just an

216
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:28,440
alias pointing to the same yeah yeah

217
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:33,180
that's called Shadow copy this is

218
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:37,200
channel copy but it's p equals copy dot

219
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:39,480
d copy a then b and a is a separate it's

220
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,760
like everything I want to make a column

221
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,459
of Eric and another separate average is

222
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,620
here

223
00:10:43,459 --> 00:10:49,500
yeah I touched this area it doesn't mean

224
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:51,120
I touch Diana Eric right this is a

225
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:54,180
separate coffee

226
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,620
the D copy we can also do this syntax P

227
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:57,959
equals a

228
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:01,500
and then put the

229
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:01,500
what's this yeah

230
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:07,260
[Music]

231
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:09,420
instead of

232
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:12,120
them so this is two tops yeah this is

233
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:15,240
least comprehension it's also means a

234
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:17,579
deep copy okay and we copy this and then

235
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:20,880
if you see I is bigger than zero right

236
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:22,980
if we still have enough digit of I then

237
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,680
we can make a copy and then push it back

238
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:28,740
to the cube Q dot append so what's the

239
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:32,279
next next is current digit is n minus n

240
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:34,800
times 10 plus I and then did copy which

241
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:37,200
is a c here

242
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,240
okay and then we turn we need to solve

243
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,200
it right again we need to solve the

244
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,959
answer

245
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,240
here we don't need to give it back okay

246
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:47,700
so if CI bigger then we copy it and then

247
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:50,160
we see I minus equals one right we need

248
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:52,140
to decrement because we're using one

249
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,820
more digit of I but we don't need to

250
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:57,000
give it back because we're making a deep

251
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:59,760
copy okay it's different than

252
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,480
deaf as such because this frequency is

253
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:07,380
the is kind of global

254
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:11,760
is is modifying this uh counter so once

255
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:13,820
we decrement we follow the digit I we

256
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:17,399
need to give it back does it make sense

257
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:20,220
okay here we don't because we make a big

258
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:22,620
copy we push it to the queue the note in

259
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:27,180
the queue

260
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:28,500
has a number and a counter so it's a

261
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,940
different counter right different

262
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:34,019
counter so it doesn't matter you don't

263
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:37,260
need to change it change it back okay so

264
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:39,240
by looking at this both uh approach the

265
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:40,560
definite search Professor you know the

266
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,480
same time complexity in this case

267
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,880
because we need to find all the three

268
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,980
digit even numbers we are actually prove

269
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:51,980
something using different uh travels and

270
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:55,560
order but that's as such space usage is

271
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:58,380
because professors we need to store all

272
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,279
the nodes in that field right for that

273
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:02,700
massage

274
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:04,500
we don't make sense

275
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:06,800
last time we talked about iterative

276
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,800
difference

277
00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:12,899
in the space usage okay

278
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:16,560
about finding free

279
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:20,160
even three digit numbers from an array

280
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,779
I'm using deficit

281
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,920
this is deficit we are not talking about

282
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:24,920
differences what's it is

283
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:32,100
okay so this is not new today this is

284
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:34,079
what we talked about last time okay just

285
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:36,000
different ways of solving this problem

286
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,120
okay

287
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,120
um

288
00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:43,339
the three digit uh

289
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,180
um

290
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:58,500
so we don't have to borrow it because in

291
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:01,139
something like yeah probably what

292
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:04,440
channel it doesn't do both kind of like

293
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:07,380
it's like a mirror and so like what do

294
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:09,680
you do to one it does two hours it's

295
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:13,680
kind of like a mirror

296
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:16,800
so so you do something to be you have to

297
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:21,300
do it to a that you don't want to do a

298
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:23,639
so so you put a back so again and so

299
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:26,700
that's why you think

300
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:28,680
okay one last question what do we store

301
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:31,200
in the notes of the prefer search like

302
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:33,600
in the queue it's a tablet so what's

303
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,980
what's zero what's counter what's this

304
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,300
what's the first number what's this

305
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,579
what's f

306
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:41,699
kill the problem look we're taking the

307
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:43,880
note from the Q so what do we store in a

308
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:43,880
note

309
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:50,519
the common number

310
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,139
n is the value is current number we

311
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:54,260
improved something that three digits

312
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:58,920
right this is calculum f is the

313
00:14:54,260 --> 00:15:01,380
remaining digit we can put on the right

314
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:03,720
hand side of the current number now you

315
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:06,300
get it right so that's why we check if c

316
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,339
i bigger than zero we have sphere have

317
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:11,880
remaining digit of I then we can put it

318
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:14,699
on the right hand side n times 10 plus I

319
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:19,320
but for example if n equals 12

320
00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:21,060
times 10 is 120 plus 3 is 1 2 3.

321
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,760
and then remaining

322
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:25,740
remaining digit is C we made a deep copy

323
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:31,240
of the current remaining digits and we

324
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:34,690
decrease by one okay okay that's it bye

325
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,690
