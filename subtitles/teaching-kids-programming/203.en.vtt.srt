hello hello mr mr ryan how are you today
okay so today it's very easy today we

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:08,720
okay so today it's very easy today we
 

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:09,509
okay so today it's very easy today we
have number

6
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:09,519
have number
 

7
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,629
have number
like one two three or minus three to

8
00:00:12,629 --> 00:00:12,639
like one two three or minus three to
 

9
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:15,910
like one two three or minus three to
five and this is bigger

10
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:15,920
five and this is bigger
 

11
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,870
five and this is bigger
yeah i want you to tell me that if i

12
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:18,880
yeah i want you to tell me that if i
 

13
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,230
yeah i want you to tell me that if i
give you one letter

14
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:20,240
give you one letter
 

15
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,630
give you one letter
five inserting five into any places and

16
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:24,640
five inserting five into any places and
 

17
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,470
five inserting five into any places and
find the maximum number it can be

18
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:28,480
find the maximum number it can be
 

19
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,109
find the maximum number it can be
five five one two three and then this

20
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:31,119
five five one two three and then this
 

21
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:31,669
five five one two three and then this
one

22
00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:31,679
one
 

23
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,270
one
the maximum three minus three to

24
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:35,280
the maximum three minus three to
 

25
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,229
the maximum three minus three to
five five yeah minus three two five five

26
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:38,239
five five yeah minus three two five five
 

27
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:39,030
five five yeah minus three two five five
yes

28
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:39,040
yes
 

29
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,430
yes
okay another example like

30
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:43,440

 

31
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,590

three six uh

32
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:47,600
three six uh
 

33
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,950
three six uh
uh six three six

34
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:50,960
uh six three six
 

35
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,110
uh six three six
okay what's the back what's the biggest

36
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:53,120
okay what's the back what's the biggest
 

37
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,549
okay what's the back what's the biggest
number you can be

38
00:00:54,549 --> 00:00:54,559
number you can be
 

39
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,869
number you can be
by putting a fight six five don't need

40
00:00:56,869 --> 00:00:56,879
by putting a fight six five don't need
 

41
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,389
by putting a fight six five don't need
to be big

42
00:00:58,389 --> 00:00:58,399
to be big
 

43
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,189
to be big
need to be next to the biggest number

44
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:01,199
need to be next to the biggest number
 

45
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,630
need to be next to the biggest number
okay so what's your strategy

46
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:02,640
okay so what's your strategy
 

47
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,630
okay so what's your strategy
if you are allowed to put the five in

48
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:04,640
if you are allowed to put the five in
 

49
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,830
if you are allowed to put the five in
any letters

50
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:05,840
any letters
 

51
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,310
any letters
what's your approach what's your

52
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:08,320
what's your approach what's your
 

53
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,109
what's your approach what's your
approach

54
00:01:11,109 --> 00:01:11,119

 

55
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,580

yeah you're right what's the approach

56
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:14,590

 

57
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,070

five so how how can we do this

60
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:20,960
five so how how can we do this
 

61
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,670
five so how how can we do this
if you're not sure what can we do three

62
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:23,680
if you're not sure what can we do three
 

63
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,390
if you're not sure what can we do three
fourths

64
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:24,400
fourths
 

65
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,590
fourths
yeah how can we improve something

66
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:27,600
yeah how can we improve something
 

67
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,990
yeah how can we improve something
yeah well

68
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:31,000
yeah well
 

69
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,069
yeah well
interesting so what's your approach why

70
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:34,079
interesting so what's your approach why
 

71
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,510
interesting so what's your approach why
why you choose to why are you she

72
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:37,520
why you choose to why are you she
 

73
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,149
why you choose to why are you she
put it yeah this one why you choose to

74
00:01:40,149 --> 00:01:40,159
put it yeah this one why you choose to
 

75
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,749
put it yeah this one why you choose to
put it in the front what for this one

76
00:01:41,749 --> 00:01:41,759
put it in the front what for this one
 

77
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:42,870
put it in the front what for this one
why you choose after

78
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:42,880
why you choose after
 

79
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,710
why you choose after
it because for this one because

80
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:46,720
it because for this one because
 

81
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,149
it because for this one because
we print because all of it

82
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:50,159
we print because all of it
 

83
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,230
we print because all of it
all of the numbers are smaller than five

84
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:52,240
all of the numbers are smaller than five
 

85
00:01:52,240 --> 00:02:01,170
all of the numbers are smaller than five
so we put it

86
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:01,180

 

87
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:07,030

[Music]

88
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:07,040

 

89
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,350

the five after we don't need this one

90
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:09,360
the five after we don't need this one
 

91
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,270
the five after we don't need this one
because this six is bigger than this one

92
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:11,280
because this six is bigger than this one
 

93
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:11,990
because this six is bigger than this one
this greater

94
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:12,000
this greater
 

95
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,589
this greater
than 600 and this is just six

96
00:02:15,589 --> 00:02:15,599
than 600 and this is just six
 

97
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,710
than 600 and this is just six
okay okay interesting yes and

98
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:18,720
okay okay interesting yes and
 

99
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,350
okay okay interesting yes and
so you try to find for the positive

100
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:21,360
so you try to find for the positive
 

101
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,949
so you try to find for the positive
cases you try to

102
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:22,959
cases you try to
 

103
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,790
cases you try to
from the left to the right you're trying

104
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:24,800
from the left to the right you're trying
 

105
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,710
from the left to the right you're trying
to find

106
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:26,720
to find
 

107
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,830
to find
but find uh

108
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:29,840
but find uh
 

109
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,270
but find uh
if there's five here what should we do

110
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:33,280
if there's five here what should we do
 

111
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,790
if there's five here what should we do
if we trying to find the number which is

112
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:36,800
if we trying to find the number which is
 

113
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,589
if we trying to find the number which is
less than the digit which is less than

114
00:02:39,589 --> 00:02:39,599
less than the digit which is less than

116

five
 

117
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,630
five
right yeah if if this is five what

118
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:42,640
right yeah if if this is five what
 

119
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,430
right yeah if if this is five what
happens

120
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:43,440
happens
 

121
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,910
happens
if you put it in front or put it at the

122
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:45,920
if you put it in front or put it at the
 

123
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,270
if you put it in front or put it at the
back right

124
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:47,280
back right
 

125
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,190
back right
it's the other side for this one minus

126
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:53,200

 

127
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,790

we put it at the end because because

128
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:56,800
we put it at the end because because
 

129
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,390
we put it at the end because because
instead of in front because

130
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:00,400

 

131
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,720

the smaller digits there are

00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:03,730

yeah the opposite obviously yeah that's

140
00:03:26,869 --> 00:03:26,879
yeah the opposite obviously yeah that's
 

141
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:27,509
yeah the opposite obviously yeah that's
very good

142

very good
 

143
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,350
very good
very good uh how i mean

144
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:31,360
very good uh how i mean
 

145
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,710
very good uh how i mean
given these three digits in the worst

146
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:34,720
given these three digits in the worst
 

147
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,470
given these three digits in the worst
case we have to try

148
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:36,480
case we have to try
 

149
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,589
case we have to try
right every every one so we can just

150
00:03:39,589 --> 00:03:39,599
right every every one so we can just
 

151
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,229
right every every one so we can just
try to inserting the digit in every

152
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:42,239
try to inserting the digit in every
 

153
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,949
try to inserting the digit in every
position and then we try to convert that

154
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:44,959
position and then we try to convert that
 

155
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,550
position and then we try to convert that
into integer i'm right yes yes

156
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:48,560
into integer i'm right yes yes
 

157
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,670
into integer i'm right yes yes
yeah i'm all right so all right so

158
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:51,680
yeah i'm all right so all right so
 

159
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,710
yeah i'm all right so all right so
five for example like one two five

160
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:54,720
five for example like one two five
 

161
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,550
five for example like one two five
five one two how many positions can we

162
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:56,560
five one two how many positions can we
 

163
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,550
five one two how many positions can we
put the five in

164
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:00,560
put the five in
 

165
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,110
put the five in
how many positions five yes one two

166
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:03,120
how many positions five yes one two
 

167
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,509
how many positions five yes one two
three four five yeah but for the minus

168
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:05,519
three four five yeah but for the minus
 

169
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,429
three four five yeah but for the minus
one two three how many positions can we

170
00:04:07,429 --> 00:04:07,439
one two three how many positions can we
 

171
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,789
one two three how many positions can we
put

172
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:08,799
put
 

173
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,149
put
one one two three

174
00:04:12,149 --> 00:04:12,159
one one two three
 

175
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,309
one one two three
three four right because you can't put a

176
00:04:14,309 --> 00:04:14,319
three four right because you can't put a
 

177
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,990
three four right because you can't put a
whole five here it doesn't make sense

178
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:16,000
whole five here it doesn't make sense
 

179
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,870
whole five here it doesn't make sense
right

180
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:16,880
right
 

181
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,430
right
five minus one yeah it's not a very

182
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:19,440
five minus one yeah it's not a very
 

183
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:19,909
five minus one yeah it's not a very
number

184
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:19,919
number
 

185
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,350
number
okay okay is

186
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:23,360
okay okay is
 

187
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,390
okay okay is
uh okay minus

188
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:26,400
uh okay minus
 

189
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,990
uh okay minus
minus minus 17 minus 25

190
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:30,000
minus minus 17 minus 25
 

191
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,110
minus minus 17 minus 25
minus minus 18

192
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:33,120
minus minus 18
 

193
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,150
minus minus 18
minus 119

194
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:38,160

 

195
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,670

and so what do we do now this n is an

196
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:41,680
and so what do we do now this n is an
 

197
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,350
and so what do we do now this n is an
integer we want to convert it to one

198
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:43,360
integer we want to convert it to one
 

199
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:43,909
integer we want to convert it to one
string

200
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:43,919
string
 

201
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,790
string
yeah we want to convert it to a string

202
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:46,800
yeah we want to convert it to a string
 

203
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,150
yeah we want to convert it to a string
alright so how do we do this

204
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:48,160
alright so how do we do this
 

205
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,950
alright so how do we do this
let's what's the function if we want to

206
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:50,960
let's what's the function if we want to
 

207
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,790
let's what's the function if we want to
convert it to string

208
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:52,800
convert it to string
 

209
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,990
convert it to string
remember s equals

210
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:56,000
remember s equals
 

211
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,590
remember s equals
that's what the string string

212
00:04:59,590 --> 00:04:59,600
that's what the string string
 

213
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,390
that's what the string string
yeah how what's the function to call to

214
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:02,400
yeah how what's the function to call to
 

215
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,710
yeah how what's the function to call to
convert a number into string

216
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:04,720
convert a number into string
 

217
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,150
convert a number into string
what's the first three letter of a

218
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:06,160
what's the first three letter of a
 

219
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,390
what's the first three letter of a
string str

220
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:08,400
string str
 

221
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,670
string str
yeah sdr okay yeah all right

222
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:11,680
yeah sdr okay yeah all right
 

223
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,110
yeah sdr okay yeah all right
look then then the answer

224
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:15,120
look then then the answer
 

225
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,710
look then then the answer
let's at the beginning the answer will

226
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:16,720
let's at the beginning the answer will
 

227
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,430
let's at the beginning the answer will
be what

228
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:19,440

 

229
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,270

if we want to get the maximum what's the

230
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:21,280
if we want to get the maximum what's the
 

231
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,110
if we want to get the maximum what's the
what's the initial value of the answer

232
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:27,120

 

233
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,670

no you could be negative so you could be

234
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:29,680
no you could be negative so you could be
 

235
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,629
no you could be negative so you could be
we should put on

236
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:30,639
we should put on
 

237
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,830
we should put on
what minus what math infinity

238
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:33,840
what minus what math infinity
 

239
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,310
what minus what math infinity
well done yeah so because we want to get

240
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:36,320
well done yeah so because we want to get
 

241
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,990
well done yeah so because we want to get
a maximum

242
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:38,000
a maximum
 

243
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,029
a maximum
right and now look if n

244
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:41,039
right and now look if n
 

245
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:45,029
right and now look if n
is greater than zero if it is bigger or

246
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:45,039
is greater than zero if it is bigger or
 

247
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,310
is greater than zero if it is bigger or
it's very smaller right

248
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:46,320
it's very smaller right
 

249
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,510
it's very smaller right
yeah so let's say the flag like f equal

250
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:49,520
yeah so let's say the flag like f equal
 

251
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:55,670
yeah so let's say the flag like f equal
if n goes zero let's start from

252
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:55,680

 

253
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,469

right because if it's negative cases i i

254
00:05:58,469 --> 00:05:58,479
right because if it's negative cases i i
 

255
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,150
right because if it's negative cases i i
don't want to put it in

256
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:00,160
don't want to put it in
 

257
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,469
don't want to put it in
here i want to start it from putting the

258
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:02,479
here i want to start it from putting the
 

259
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:03,350
here i want to start it from putting the
partition

260
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:03,360
partition
 

261
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,070
partition
let's what the one comes comes from yeah

262
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,080
let's what the one comes comes from yeah
 

263
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,150
let's what the one comes comes from yeah
offset

264
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,160
offset
 

265
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,270
offset
f for i equals

266
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:11,280
f for i equals
 

267
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,469
f for i equals
for i in range

268
00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:14,479
for i in range
 

269
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,990
for i in range
tau is the f and then ends with the

270
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,000
tau is the f and then ends with the
 

271
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,870
tau is the f and then ends with the
length

272
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:18,880
length
 

273
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,189
length
the length of the m plus one yeah

274
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:21,199
the length of the m plus one yeah
 

275
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,150
the length of the m plus one yeah
because

276
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:22,160
because
 

277
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,150
because
because we can put it one two three we

278
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:24,160
because we can put it one two three we
 

279
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,830
because we can put it one two three we
can put it at the end at the

280
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:25,840
can put it at the end at the
 

281
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,270
can put it at the end at the
end right yeah yeah

282
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:29,280
end right yeah yeah
 

283
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,230
end right yeah yeah
yeah stop jumping okay then now the

284
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:32,240
yeah stop jumping okay then now the
 

285
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,670
yeah stop jumping okay then now the
color number will be what

286
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:33,680
color number will be what
 

287
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,870
color number will be what
c equals

288
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:36,880
c equals
 

289
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,870
c equals
s right hey put it at the beginning

290
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:40,880
s right hey put it at the beginning
 

291
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,990
s right hey put it at the beginning
i i'm gonna pass the five here

292
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:44,000
i i'm gonna pass the five here
 

293
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,510
i i'm gonna pass the five here
and i need to plus s i right

294
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:47,520
and i need to plus s i right
 

295
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,150
and i need to plus s i right
what does it mean look all right look

296
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:50,160
what does it mean look all right look
 

297
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,830
what does it mean look all right look
one two three if i want to put it here

298
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:53,840
one two three if i want to put it here
 

299
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,589
one two three if i want to put it here
if i want to put it here what does this

300
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:55,599
if i want to put it here what does this
 

301
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:56,950
if i want to put it here what does this
mean s i

302
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:56,960
mean s i
 

303
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,189
mean s i
mean it's this particular position and

304
00:06:59,189 --> 00:06:59,199
mean it's this particular position and
 

305
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,390
mean it's this particular position and
then 5

306
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:00,400
then 5
 

307
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,830
then 5
i put a 5 here and s i column is this

308
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:03,840
i put a 5 here and s i column is this
 

309
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,390
i put a 5 here and s i column is this
bit yeah anything after

310
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:06,400
bit yeah anything after
 

311
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,430
bit yeah anything after
and then i need to com check the maximum

312
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:09,440
and then i need to com check the maximum
 

313
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,950
and then i need to com check the maximum
so how to write the answer equals 1.

314
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:14,960

 

315
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,469

maximum yeah maximum or what answer

316
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:18,479
maximum yeah maximum or what answer
 

317
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,589
maximum yeah maximum or what answer
yeah and then what let's see what should

318
00:07:21,589 --> 00:07:21,599
yeah and then what let's see what should
 

319
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,629
yeah and then what let's see what should
we do we see

320
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:22,639
we do we see
 

321
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,189
we do we see
c is the integer is the string we want

322
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:25,199
c is the integer is the string we want
 

323
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,150
c is the integer is the string we want
to convert it

324
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:26,160
to convert it
 

325
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:42,469
to convert it
back to string back to integer integer

326
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:42,479

 

327
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,589

what's the time complexity what's the

328
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:45,599
what's the time complexity what's the
 

329
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,510
what's the time complexity what's the
time commentary

330
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:47,520
time commentary
 

331
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,589
time commentary
what's n a number of

332
00:07:50,589 --> 00:07:50,599
what's n a number of
 

333
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:54,390
what's n a number of
numbers plus one the number of digits

334
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:54,400
numbers plus one the number of digits
 

335
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:03,270
numbers plus one the number of digits
yeah we're talking about the digits

336
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:03,280

[Music]
 

339
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:14,790
[Music]
so what's the space complexity

340
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:14,800

 

341
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,749

so this is for i and let's see

342
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:19,759

 

343
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,670

okay what's this what's this big what's

344
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:21,680
okay what's this what's this big what's
 

345
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,670
okay what's this what's this big what's
this okay

346
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:23,680
this okay
 

347
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:39,110
this okay
what's this bit okay

348
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:39,120

 

349
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,990

like it okay we want to split the string

350
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:42,000
like it okay we want to split the string
 

351
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,149
like it okay we want to split the string
and put the five in so what's the string

352
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:44,159
and put the five in so what's the string
 

353
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,389
and put the five in so what's the string
here

354
00:08:46,389 --> 00:08:46,399
here
 

355
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,070
here
yeah column yeah yeah column i

356
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:50,080
yeah column yeah yeah column i
 

357
00:08:50,080 --> 00:09:04,310
yeah column yeah yeah column i
don't know this one column

358
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:04,320

 

359
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,430

plus five yeah that's right i put the f5

360
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:07,440
plus five yeah that's right i put the f5
 

361
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:14,389
plus five yeah that's right i put the f5
here and i want to put anything

362
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:14,399

 

363
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,670

why are you clicking it don't write it

364
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:15,680
why are you clicking it don't write it
 

365
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,910
why are you clicking it don't write it
so hard okay don't waste the

366
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:17,920
so hard okay don't waste the
 

367
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:27,590
so hard okay don't waste the
pen okay i iowa column

368
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:27,600

 

369
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,670

okay can you tell me why this is if n

370
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:29,680
okay can you tell me why this is if n
 

371
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,350
okay can you tell me why this is if n
equals zero bigger than zero f

372
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:31,360
equals zero bigger than zero f
 

373
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,230
equals zero bigger than zero f
is zero what does it mean if it's a

374
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:34,240
is zero what does it mean if it's a
 

375
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,470
is zero what does it mean if it's a
positive number and if it's a negative

376
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:36,480
positive number and if it's a negative
 

377
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,310
positive number and if it's a negative
number why the negative number is one

378
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:38,320
number why the negative number is one
 

379
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,710
number why the negative number is one
because we don't want to do this minus

380
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:40,720
because we don't want to do this minus
 

381
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,350
because we don't want to do this minus
yeah

382
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:41,360
yeah
 

383
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,870
yeah
we don't want to put aside before right

384
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:44,880
we don't want to put aside before right
 

385
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,310
we don't want to put aside before right
right i the index where to put a plus

386
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:48,320
right i the index where to put a plus
 

387
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,350
right i the index where to put a plus
plus right yeah got it oh yeah baby
