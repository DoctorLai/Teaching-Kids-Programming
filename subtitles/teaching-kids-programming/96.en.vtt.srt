okay so

4
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:16,080
okay so
 

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,150
okay so
first of all remind me what kind of

6
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:18,160
first of all remind me what kind of
 

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,510
first of all remind me what kind of
numbers have you learned

8
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:19,520
numbers have you learned
 

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,349
numbers have you learned
so far ugly number happy number sad

10
00:00:23,349 --> 00:00:23,359
so far ugly number happy number sad
 

11
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,029
so far ugly number happy number sad
and confusing okay so happy number

12
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:27,039
and confusing okay so happy number
 

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,390
and confusing okay so happy number
what's happy number

14
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:28,400
what's happy number
 

15
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,790
what's happy number
uh if you just whatever did you until

16
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:30,800
uh if you just whatever did you until
 

17
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,750
uh if you just whatever did you until
you get one

18
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:31,760
you get one
 

19
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,709
you get one
yeah and what's the confusing number uh

20
00:00:34,709 --> 00:00:34,719
yeah and what's the confusing number uh
 

21
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:35,990
yeah and what's the confusing number uh
it's when you turn it

22
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:36,000
it's when you turn it
 

23
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,869
it's when you turn it
upside down yeah it's still a number but

24
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:38,879
upside down yeah it's still a number but
 

25
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:39,670
upside down yeah it's still a number but
it's different

26
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:39,680
it's different
 

27
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,549
it's different
okay what's the and what was there

28
00:00:42,549 --> 00:00:42,559
okay what's the and what was there
 

29
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,190
okay what's the and what was there
another one you talked about

30
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:45,200
another one you talked about
 

31
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,229
another one you talked about
number it only has the factors the

32
00:00:48,229 --> 00:00:48,239
number it only has the factors the
 

33
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,990
number it only has the factors the
two three and five right yeah uh devices

34
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:52,000
two three and five right yeah uh devices
 

35
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,910
two three and five right yeah uh devices
okay so this perfect number is something

36
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:53,920
okay so this perfect number is something
 

37
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,830
okay so this perfect number is something
to do with the divisor as well so

38
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:55,840
to do with the divisor as well so
 

39
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,189
to do with the divisor as well so
for example 28 yeah is 28 a perfect

40
00:00:59,189 --> 00:00:59,199
for example 28 yeah is 28 a perfect
 

41
00:00:59,199 --> 00:00:59,670
for example 28 yeah is 28 a perfect
number

42
00:00:59,670 --> 00:00:59,680
number
 

43
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,510
number
yes why is that because 2j is a divisor

44
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:03,520
yes why is that because 2j is a divisor
 

45
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,870
yes why is that because 2j is a divisor
1 2 4

46
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:06,880
1 2 4
 

47
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,469
1 2 4
7 14 okay but not 28 not including

48
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:10,479
7 14 okay but not 28 not including
 

49
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,550
7 14 okay but not 28 not including
excluding is there okay so what's the

50
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:12,560
excluding is there okay so what's the
 

51
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,270
excluding is there okay so what's the
divisor added together

52
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:15,280
divisor added together
 

53
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,550
divisor added together
what's this 3 7

54
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:18,560
what's this 3 7
 

55
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,149
what's this 3 7
10 28 yeah

56
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:22,159
10 28 yeah
 

57
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,030
10 28 yeah
it is

58
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:27,040
it is
 

59
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,950
it is
is it so this is the perfect number do

60
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:28,960
is it so this is the perfect number do
 

61
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,270
is it so this is the perfect number do
you get it it's divisor look at this

62
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:31,280
you get it it's divisor look at this
 

63
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,390
you get it it's divisor look at this
this what's divisor so this number

64
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:34,400
this what's divisor so this number
 

65
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,429
this what's divisor so this number
can be divided 28 divided by 1

66
00:01:37,429 --> 00:01:37,439
can be divided 28 divided by 1
 

67
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,749
can be divided 28 divided by 1
28 28 2

68
00:01:41,749 --> 00:01:41,759

 

69
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,030

yes so any

70
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:45,040
yes so any
 

71
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,149
yes so any
thoughts how we doing this any idea

72
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:48,159
thoughts how we doing this any idea
 

73
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,749
thoughts how we doing this any idea
how are we doing this say

74
00:01:51,749 --> 00:01:51,759
how are we doing this say
 

75
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,149
how are we doing this say
we just why what are the numbers

76
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:56,159
we just why what are the numbers
 

77
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,749
we just why what are the numbers
so we iterate divided by 28.

78
00:01:59,749 --> 00:01:59,759
so we iterate divided by 28.
 

79
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,270
so we iterate divided by 28.
then they must equal 28. so we check

80
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:03,280
then they must equal 28. so we check
 

81
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,030
then they must equal 28. so we check
yeah so first of all we need to go

82
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:05,040
yeah so first of all we need to go
 

83
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,030
yeah so first of all we need to go
through these numbers

84
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:07,040
through these numbers
 

85
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,749
through these numbers
yeah and to find out if it can be

86
00:02:09,749 --> 00:02:09,759
yeah and to find out if it can be
 

87
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,309
yeah and to find out if it can be
devised

88
00:02:10,309 --> 00:02:10,319
devised
 

89
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,030
devised
if it's a divisor if it's a divisor then

90
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,040
if it's a divisor if it's a divisor then
 

91
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,390
if it's a divisor if it's a divisor then
we add a number

92
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:14,400
we add a number
 

93
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,790
we add a number
yeah and then we finally check if this

94
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:16,800
yeah and then we finally check if this
 

95
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,470
yeah and then we finally check if this
number is

96
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:18,480
number is
 

97
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,990
number is
the itself is same yeah

98
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,000
the itself is same yeah
 

99
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,710
the itself is same yeah
is definitely not perfect sorry

100
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:26,720
is definitely not perfect sorry
 

101
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,790
is definitely not perfect sorry
apply number definitely not perfect

102
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:30,800
apply number definitely not perfect
 

103
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,509
apply number definitely not perfect
well done yeah because it cannot be

104
00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:33,519
well done yeah because it cannot be
 

105
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:34,710
well done yeah because it cannot be
equal to yourself yeah

106
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:34,720
equal to yourself yeah
 

107
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,470
equal to yourself yeah
that's number cannot be a perfect number

108
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:38,480
that's number cannot be a perfect number
 

109
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,869
that's number cannot be a perfect number
of course it's it's not uh

110
00:02:42,869 --> 00:02:42,879

 

111
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:48,830

it's one one is the perfect number yeah

112
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:48,840

 

113
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,110

two

114
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:51,120
two
 

115
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,030
two
no no uh no okay so one is a very

116
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:55,040
no no uh no okay so one is a very
 

117
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,350
no no uh no okay so one is a very
special case so

118
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:57,360
special case so
 

119
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,550
special case so
this one the perfect number maybe

120
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:00,560
this one the perfect number maybe
 

121
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,589
this one the perfect number maybe
it might be yes yes okay so zero is not

122
00:03:03,589 --> 00:03:03,599
it might be yes yes okay so zero is not
 

123
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,949
it might be yes yes okay so zero is not
a perfect number right

124
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:04,959
a perfect number right
 

125
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,229
a perfect number right
yeah negative numbers not perfect number

126
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:08,239
yeah negative numbers not perfect number
 

127
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,350
yeah negative numbers not perfect number
yeah

128
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:09,360
yeah
 

129
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,190
yeah
okay so let's try this define

130
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:13,200
okay so let's try this define
 

131
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,470
okay so let's try this define
perfect perfect what's perfect

132
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:16,480
perfect perfect what's perfect
 

133
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,750
perfect perfect what's perfect
good very good yeah what's the opposite

134
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:19,760
good very good yeah what's the opposite
 

135
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,790
good very good yeah what's the opposite
of perfect

136
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:22,800

 

137
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,229

i don't know okay and yeah

138
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:26,239
i don't know okay and yeah
 

139
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,830
i don't know okay and yeah
okay if and smaller equals zero

140
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:30,840
okay if and smaller equals zero
 

141
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:39,350
okay if and smaller equals zero
return

142
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:39,360

 

143
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,550

okay so now we we sum this digit in

144
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:42,560
okay so now we we sum this digit in
 

145
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,750
okay so now we we sum this digit in
some number in s okay s first one zero

146
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:45,760
some number in s okay s first one zero
 

147
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,390
some number in s okay s first one zero
okay

148
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:46,400
okay
 

149
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,630
okay
so for i in

150
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:50,640
so for i in
 

151
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,550
so for i in
range range one start from one right

152
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:54,560
range range one start from one right
 

153
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,470
range range one start from one right
yeah the number is done from one number

154
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:58,480
yeah the number is done from one number
 

155
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,710
yeah the number is done from one number
so do we need to go above half

156
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:02,720
so do we need to go above half
 

157
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,470
so do we need to go above half
like if there is no no because 28

158
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:06,480
like if there is no no because 28
 

159
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,910
like if there is no no because 28
listen it's impossible to find a divisor

160
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:09,920
listen it's impossible to find a divisor
 

161
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,869
listen it's impossible to find a divisor
that is bigger than half of it right am

162
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:12,879
that is bigger than half of it right am
 

163
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:13,670
that is bigger than half of it right am
i right

164
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:13,680
i right
 

165
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,150
i right
any number like a hundred cannot be

166
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:16,160
any number like a hundred cannot be
 

167
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,949
any number like a hundred cannot be
divided by

168
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:16,959
divided by
 

169
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,509
divided by
some number more than 50 right yeah you

170
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:19,519
some number more than 50 right yeah you
 

171
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,150
some number more than 50 right yeah you
got it

172
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:20,160
got it
 

173
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,830
got it
so 60 this this n

so 60 this this n
 

175
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,629
so 60 this this n
divided by two by plus one yeah because

00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:56,800
in something evil and
 

201
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,629
in something evil and
what's this percentage what does that

202
00:04:58,629 --> 00:04:58,639
what's this percentage what does that
 

203
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,230
what's this percentage what does that
mean

204
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:00,240
mean
 

205
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,590
mean
i think it's something like i didn't

206
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:03,600
i think it's something like i didn't
 

207
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,189
i think it's something like i didn't
know how to explain

208
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:05,199
know how to explain
 

209
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:25,830
know how to explain
modulus yeah and yeah

210
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:25,840

 

211
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,150

okay so now what should i do here what

212
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:28,160
okay so now what should i do here what
 

213
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,510
okay so now what should i do here what
should i do here

214
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:29,520
should i do here
 

215
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,189
should i do here
what should i do here we can something

216
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:33,199
what should i do here we can something
 

217
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:39,909
what should i do here we can something
s yeah s s one plus plus one

218
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:39,919

 

219
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,469

okay so we plus all the divisors yeah

220
00:05:42,469 --> 00:05:42,479
okay so we plus all the divisors yeah
 

221
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:42,950
okay so we plus all the divisors yeah
yeah

222
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:42,960
yeah
 

223
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:59,189
yeah
we pass already and we turn

224
00:05:59,189 --> 00:05:59,199

 

225
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,230

even though this number goes through

226
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:02,240
even though this number goes through
 

227
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,230
even though this number goes through
just half of it but it's still always

228
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:04,240
just half of it but it's still always
 

229
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:15,990
just half of it but it's still always
it's nino yeah

00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:16,000

 

231
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,909

can we make it better can we make it

232
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:17,919
can we make it better can we make it
 

233
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,390
can we make it better can we make it
better do you notice something

234
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:20,400
better do you notice something
 

235
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,390
better do you notice something

245
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,830
4 7 14 okay and possibly 28
here so what do you notice what do you

246
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:37,840
here so what do you notice what do you
 

247
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,830
here so what do you notice what do you
notice

248
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:39,840
notice
 

249
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,390
notice
two and fourteen four and seven

250
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:44,400
two and fourteen four and seven
 

251
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,830
two and fourteen four and seven
one and twenty eight so what does it

252
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:46,840
one and twenty eight so what does it
 

253
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,710
one and twenty eight so what does it
mean they all

254
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:48,720
mean they all
 

255
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,150
mean they all
times out together yes so if if i follow

256
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:52,160
times out together yes so if if i follow
 

257
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,270
times out together yes so if if i follow
a two

258
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:53,280
a two
 

259
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,309
a two
factor direction two yeah there must be

260
00:06:56,309 --> 00:06:56,319
factor direction two yeah there must be
 

261
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,790
factor direction two yeah there must be
another factor which is 24

262
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:58,800
another factor which is 24
 

263
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,150
another factor which is 24
uh 28 divided by two all right yeah

264
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:02,160
uh 28 divided by two all right yeah
 

265
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,110
uh 28 divided by two all right yeah
if i find the four what does it mean i

266
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:05,120
if i find the four what does it mean i
 

267
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,390
if i find the four what does it mean i
also find 28

268
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:06,400
also find 28
 

269
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,430
also find 28
divided by four all right because look

270
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:09,440
divided by four all right because look
 

271
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,990
divided by four all right because look
if i find a divisor d you also find

272
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:12,000
if i find a divisor d you also find
 

273
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,870
if i find a divisor d you also find
something

274
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:12,880
something
 

275
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:18,390
something
n divided by d and you

276
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:18,400

 

277
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,309

yeah so what does it mean i don't need

278
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:20,319
yeah so what does it mean i don't need
 

279
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,550
yeah so what does it mean i don't need
to go through to half i only think i

280
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:22,560
to go through to half i only think i
 

281
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,110
to go through to half i only think i
only

282
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:23,120
only
 

283
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,990
only
need to go through my face i only need

284
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:26,000
need to go through my face i only need
 

285
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,790
need to go through my face i only need
to go through

286
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:28,800

 

287
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,070

the numbers when i

288
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:32,080
the numbers when i
 

289
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,189
the numbers when i
times i square is smaller than y

290
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:35,199
times i square is smaller than y
 

291
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,469
times i square is smaller than y
equals n right okay so look i

292
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:38,479
equals n right okay so look i
 

293
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,629
equals n right okay so look i
square smaller or equals m so what does

294
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:40,639
square smaller or equals m so what does
 

295
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:41,510
square smaller or equals m so what does
it mean

296
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:41,520
it mean
 

297
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,070
it mean
what does it mean it means i smaller

298
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,080
what does it mean it means i smaller
 

299
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,110
what does it mean it means i smaller
than square n

300
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:45,120
than square n
 

301
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,629
than square n
all right it's the same thing yeah yes

302
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:48,639
all right it's the same thing yeah yes
 

303
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,749
all right it's the same thing yeah yes
okay so look so it will be faster okay

304
00:07:51,749 --> 00:07:51,759
okay so look so it will be faster okay
 

305
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:52,629
okay so look so it will be faster okay
so

306
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:52,639
so
 

307
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,070
so
let me write the code okay look

308
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:56,080
let me write the code okay look
 

309
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,950
let me write the code okay look
yeah this is the same okay so now

310
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:00,960
yeah this is the same okay so now
 

311
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,189
yeah this is the same okay so now
i still have s equals zero okay here

312
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:03,199
i still have s equals zero okay here
 

313
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,710
i still have s equals zero okay here
right right

314
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:04,720
right right
 

315
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,790
right right
to enter the uh to to solve the number

316
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:06,800
to enter the uh to to solve the number
 

317
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,629
to enter the uh to to solve the number
of the to store the sum

318
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:08,639
of the to store the sum
 

319
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,309
of the to store the sum
of the direct divisors devices

320
00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:12,319
of the direct divisors devices
 

321
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,510
of the direct divisors devices
so now i will be equal to 1

322
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:15,520
so now i will be equal to 1
 

323
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,670
so now i will be equal to 1
first okay so now y

324
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:19,680
first okay so now y
 

325
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,350
first okay so now y
i times i

326
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:23,360

 

327
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,790

is smaller or equals n right yes

328
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:26,800
is smaller or equals n right yes
 

329
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,390
is smaller or equals n right yes
because now we're already we are

330
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:30,400
because now we're already we are
 

331
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,949
because now we're already we are
checking if i smaller right then what

332
00:08:32,949 --> 00:08:32,959
checking if i smaller right then what
 

333
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:34,630
checking if i smaller right then what
should we do if

334
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:34,640
should we do if
 

335
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,029
should we do if
n divided by i can we divide it yeah

336
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:39,039
n divided by i can we divide it yeah
 

337
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,230
n divided by i can we divide it yeah
so now what should we do s plus equals i

338
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:42,240
so now what should we do s plus equals i
 

339
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,230
so now what should we do s plus equals i
now i found the divisor i yeah

340
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:44,240
now i found the divisor i yeah
 

341
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,670
now i found the divisor i yeah
so what's the other part what's the

342
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:45,680
so what's the other part what's the
 

343
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,590
so what's the other part what's the
other divisor i

344
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:47,600
other divisor i
 

345
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,670
other divisor i
i divided by that and divided by

346
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:51,680
i divided by that and divided by
 

347
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,550
i divided by that and divided by
i

348
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:56,560

 

349
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,590

look there's a very special case

350
00:08:59,590 --> 00:08:59,600
look there's a very special case
 

351
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,710
look there's a very special case
like 16 yeah 16.

352
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:02,720
like 16 yeah 16.
 

353
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,190
like 16 yeah 16.
i found a four what's the other half

354
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:07,200

 

355
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,590

four yeah it's the same yeah yeah but

356
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:09,600
four yeah it's the same yeah yeah but
 

357
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,670
four yeah it's the same yeah yeah but
obviously you can only add one right

358
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:11,680
obviously you can only add one right
 

359
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,790
obviously you can only add one right
yeah do you get it because one when

360
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:14,800
yeah do you get it because one when
 

361
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,190
yeah do you get it because one when
the other n divided by i is also the

362
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:17,200
the other n divided by i is also the
 

363
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,870
the other n divided by i is also the
same you can only

364
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:18,880
same you can only
 

365
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,990
same you can only
add one right so here if

366
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:22,000
add one right so here if
 

367
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,190
add one right so here if
i times i not equals

368
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:25,200
i times i not equals
 

369
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,790
i times i not equals
not equals n right yeah all right

370
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:28,800
not equals n right yeah all right
 

371
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,829
not equals n right yeah all right
then i can edit x plus equals

372
00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:31,839
then i can edit x plus equals
 

373
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,990
then i can edit x plus equals
n divided by i right yes

374
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,000
n divided by i right yes
 

375
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,670
n divided by i right yes
okay what you doing

376
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:39,680
okay what you doing
 

377
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,230
okay what you doing
and look and then i need to increment i

378
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:42,240
and look and then i need to increment i
 

379
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,990
and look and then i need to increment i
plus equals one

380
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:44,000
plus equals one
 

381
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,110
plus equals one
okay so hey

382
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:47,120
okay so hey
 

383
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,750
okay so hey
so now what should i return here because

384
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:49,760
so now what should i return here because
 

385
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,550
so now what should i return here because
i

386
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:50,560
i
 

387
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,350
i
have i and i also have n look because i

388
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:53,360
have i and i also have n look because i
 

389
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,230
have i and i also have n look because i
at the i

390
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:54,240
at the i
 

391
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,670
at the i
and i also added n so what does it mean

392
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:57,680
and i also added n so what does it mean
 

393
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,389
and i also added n so what does it mean
look wait we turn something look look

394
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:00,399
look wait we turn something look look
 

395
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,190
look wait we turn something look look
look we turn

396
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:01,200
look we turn
 

397
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,269
look we turn
x look look i equals 1 n is 24 a

398
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:05,279
x look look i equals 1 n is 24 a
 

399
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,509
x look look i equals 1 n is 24 a
yeah all right look i equals 1.

400
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:09,519
yeah all right look i equals 1.
 

401
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,030
yeah all right look i equals 1.
look look listen to me if n

402
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:13,040
look look listen to me if n
 

403
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:18,389
look look listen to me if n
28 modulus i equals 0 i 81 right and if

404
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:18,399
28 modulus i equals 0 i 81 right and if
 

405
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,030
28 modulus i equals 0 i 81 right and if
i

406
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:19,040
i
 

407
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,750
i
if 1 times 1 not equals 28 right it's

408
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:21,760
if 1 times 1 not equals 28 right it's
 

409
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,870
if 1 times 1 not equals 28 right it's
not equal right

410
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:22,880
not equal right
 

411
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,190
not equal right
so i also added 28 divided by 1 is 28 so

412
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:27,200
so i also added 28 divided by 1 is 28 so
 

413
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,150
so i also added 28 divided by 1 is 28 so
do you see

414
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:28,160
do you see
 

415
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,190
do you see
i also added one more n right

416
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:31,200
i also added one more n right
 

417
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,269
i also added one more n right
so i should i should check return

418
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:35,279
so i should i should check return
 

419
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,949
so i should i should check return
s minus s1

420
00:10:38,949 --> 00:10:38,959
s minus s1
 

421
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,389
s minus s1
s minus n equals n right or s

422
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:42,399
s minus n equals n right or s
 

423
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,110
s minus n equals n right or s
equals n plus n is the same thing do you

424
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:45,120
equals n plus n is the same thing do you
 

425
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,910
equals n plus n is the same thing do you
see what why

426
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:45,920
see what why
 

427
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,190
see what why
this is i need to subtract subtract n

428
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:49,200
this is i need to subtract subtract n
 

429
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:49,829
this is i need to subtract subtract n
from s

430
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:49,839
from s
 

431
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,870
from s
do you get it why

432
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:52,880
do you get it why
 

433
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,269
do you get it why
i just told you why uh

434
00:10:57,269 --> 00:10:57,279

 

435
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,550

why because what because

436
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:00,560
why because what because
 

437
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,910
why because what because
because what when i equals one

438
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:03,920
because what when i equals one
 

439
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,190
because what when i equals one
and i added one more here and

440
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:07,200
and i added one more here and
 

441
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,230
and i added one more here and
you see look at it

442
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:10,240
you see look at it
 

443
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,230
you see look at it
can you repeat uh i equals one

444
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:14,240
can you repeat uh i equals one
 

445
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,350
can you repeat uh i equals one
and then s as equals and divided by

446
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:17,360
and then s as equals and divided by
 

447
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,470
and then s as equals and divided by
i yeah so but then let's wear this n is

448
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:20,480
i yeah so but then let's wear this n is
 

449
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,910
i yeah so but then let's wear this n is
wrong and i need to substitute

450
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:21,920
wrong and i need to substitute
 

451
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,470
wrong and i need to substitute
n not if it's the if it's the sum equals

452
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:24,480
n not if it's the if it's the sum equals
 

453
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,030
n not if it's the if it's the sum equals
to n i need a perfect number to get it

454
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,040
to n i need a perfect number to get it
 

455
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,230
to n i need a perfect number to get it
yeah does it make sense do you see lace

456
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:30,240
yeah does it make sense do you see lace
 

457
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:30,949
yeah does it make sense do you see lace
coat

458
00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:30,959
coat
 

459
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,350
coat
which part you don't understand

460
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:35,360

 

461
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,150

which part what's the time complexity

462
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:40,160
which part what's the time complexity
 

463
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:45,509
which part what's the time complexity
oh and

464
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:45,519

 

465
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,990

why because least i times i smaller than

466
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:48,000
why because least i times i smaller than
 

467
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,710
why because least i times i smaller than
n

468
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:48,720
n
 

469
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,990
n
so what does this mean i

470
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:52,000
so what does this mean i
 

471
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,430
so what does this mean i
square smaller equals n right

472
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:55,440
square smaller equals n right
 

473
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,790
square smaller equals n right
yeah so if i

474
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:58,800
yeah so if i
 

475
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,350
yeah so if i
square root of both sides array

476
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:03,360

 

477
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,430

so what does this become i square

478
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:07,440
so what does this become i square
 

479
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,710
so what does this become i square
i square square root is i right

480
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:10,720
i square square root is i right
 

481
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,590
i square square root is i right
yeah so i smaller than square root of n

482
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:13,600
yeah so i smaller than square root of n
 

483
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,710
yeah so i smaller than square root of n
right

484
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:14,720
right
 

485
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,509
right
yeah so if i is a hundred i only need to

486
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:17,519
yeah so if i is a hundred i only need to
 

487
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:27,509
yeah so if i is a hundred i only need to
iterate how many times

488
00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:27,519

 

489
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,470

yeah square root of 100 is 10. so

490
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:30,480
yeah square root of 100 is 10. so
 

491
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,310
yeah square root of 100 is 10. so
previously i need to iterate how many

492
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:32,320
previously i need to iterate how many
 

493
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,509
previously i need to iterate how many
times

494
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:33,519
times
 

495
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,710
times
50. yeah so which is better 10.

496
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:36,720
50. yeah so which is better 10.
 

497
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,550
50. yeah so which is better 10.
obviously 10 times is better yes the

498
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:38,560
obviously 10 times is better yes the
 

499
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,829
obviously 10 times is better yes the
computer

500
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:39,839
computer
 

501
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,350
computer
needs 10 times compared to these

502
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:43,360
needs 10 times compared to these
 

503
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,710
needs 10 times compared to these
50 times if if this n is bigger like

504
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:46,720
50 times if if this n is bigger like
 

505
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,750
50 times if if this n is bigger like
if n is a thousand

506
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:49,760
if n is a thousand
 

507
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,509
if n is a thousand
no no no maybe 10 000. ten thousand yeah

508
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:53,519
no no no maybe 10 000. ten thousand yeah
 

509
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,790
no no no maybe 10 000. ten thousand yeah
if it's ten thousand

510
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:56,800

 

511
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,150

ten thousand okay so pretty much

512
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:00,160
ten thousand okay so pretty much
 

513
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,389
ten thousand okay so pretty much
the first method how many times

514
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:04,399

 

515
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,750

five thousand times yeah and

516
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:07,760
five thousand times yeah and
 

517
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,750
five thousand times yeah and
and this this this agreement how many

518
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:09,760
and this this this agreement how many
 

519
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,030
and this this this agreement how many
times

520
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:11,040
times
 

521
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,389
times
uh 100 100 you see

522
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:14,399
uh 100 100 you see
 

523
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,590
uh 100 100 you see
now it's almost 50 times

524
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:17,600
now it's almost 50 times
 

525
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,430
now it's almost 50 times
difference do you get it yeah so one n

526
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:21,440
difference do you get it yeah so one n
 

527
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,710
difference do you get it yeah so one n
gets bigger

528
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:22,720
gets bigger
 

529
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,670
gets bigger
this this equivalent is faster a lot

530
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:25,680
this this equivalent is faster a lot
 

531
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,870
this this equivalent is faster a lot
faster than that

532
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:26,880
faster than that
 

533
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,269
faster than that
when any smaller maybe no difference for

534
00:13:29,269 --> 00:13:29,279
when any smaller maybe no difference for
 

535
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,829
when any smaller maybe no difference for
example like

536
00:13:30,829 --> 00:13:30,839
example like
 

537
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:33,910
example like
150 compared to 10

538
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:33,920
150 compared to 10
 

539
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,190
150 compared to 10
yeah this is five times and now this

540
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:37,200
yeah this is five times and now this
 

541
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,910
yeah this is five times and now this
five thousand compared to a hundred this

542
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:39,920
five thousand compared to a hundred this
 

543
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,550
five thousand compared to a hundred this
is

544
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:40,560
is
 

545
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,590
is
50 times you see you see the difference

546
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:43,600
50 times you see you see the difference
 

547
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,870
50 times you see you see the difference
