good okay so today we still talk about
this binary tree

8
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:09,200
this binary tree
 

9
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,230
this binary tree
okay so what's final retreat remember

10
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:12,240
okay so what's final retreat remember
 

11
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,630
okay so what's final retreat remember
which is

12
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:16,640
which is
 

13
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,109
which is
okay so what binary means two

14
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:21,119
okay so what binary means two
 

15
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,470
okay so what binary means two
two mean okay so

16
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:24,480
two mean okay so
 

17
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,310
two mean okay so
so it means that uh for each node

18
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:28,320
so it means that uh for each node
 

19
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,549
so it means that uh for each node
it can has you can have a maximum two

20
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:32,559
it can has you can have a maximum two
 

21

there will be
 

113
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,309
there will be
six and seven because these two

114
00:02:28,309 --> 00:02:28,319
six and seven because these two

right
does it make sense yes yeah okay

120
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:35,599
does it make sense yes yeah okay
 

121
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,229
does it make sense yes yeah okay
so how can we count this we would just

122
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:38,239
so how can we count this we would just
 

123
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:39,190
so how can we count this we would just
return two for

124
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:39,200
return two for
 

125
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,630
return two for
for example there are two only try

126
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:42,640

 

127
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,350

uh we can do

128
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:47,360
uh we can do
 

129
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,270
uh we can do
what it's five one five no because three

130
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:51,280
what it's five one five no because three
 

131
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,309
what it's five one five no because three
has two child

132
00:02:52,309 --> 00:02:52,319
has two child
 

133
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,509
has two child
does it make sense uh yeah okay okay so

yeah but it doesn't have to be the leave
 

141
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,869
yeah but it doesn't have to be the leave
thing you know for example if i put

142
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:06,879
thing you know for example if i put
 

143
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,550
thing you know for example if i put
another no yeah like

144

another no yeah like
 

145
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,390
another no yeah like
nine nine is the only trial six six is

146
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:14,400
nine nine is the only trial six six is
 

147
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,589
nine nine is the only trial six six is
only trial two so

148
00:03:15,589 --> 00:03:15,599
only trial two so
 

149
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,750
only trial two so
you have to include six nine seven so

150
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:17,760
you have to include six nine seven so
 

151
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,270
you have to include six nine seven so
that's it okay it doesn't have to be

152
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:19,280
that's it okay it doesn't have to be
 

153
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,229
that's it okay it doesn't have to be
like this

154
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:20,239
like this
 

155
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,630
like this
right basically for me to try the only

156
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:22,640
right basically for me to try the only

169
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,309
track with the deficit okay
so so let's do these preferences today

170
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:38,319
so so let's do these preferences today
 

171
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:38,949
so so let's do these preferences today
okay

172
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:38,959
okay
 

173
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,149
okay
yeah so

174
00:03:42,149 --> 00:03:42,159

 

175
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,190

tomorrow so we'll visit the finance

176
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:45,200
tomorrow so we'll visit the finance
 

177
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,789
tomorrow so we'll visit the finance
in level by level which is the

178
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:46,799
in level by level which is the
 

179
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,470
in level by level which is the
preference yeah so which order

180
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:48,480
preference yeah so which order
 

181
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,470
preference yeah so which order
if you're going through this breakfast

182
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:50,480
if you're going through this breakfast
 

183
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,509
if you're going through this breakfast

six four five nine seven well done
 

187
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,429
six four five nine seven well done
what's the difference

188
00:03:55,429 --> 00:03:55,439
what's the difference
 

189
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,869
what's the difference
in the order one two six nine

190
00:03:58,869 --> 00:03:58,879
in the order one two six nine
 

191
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,550
in the order one two six nine
three exactly in order to use the

192
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:02,560
three exactly in order to use the
 

193
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,229
three exactly in order to use the
preferences what kind of data structure

194
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:04,239
preferences what kind of data structure
 

195
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,830
preferences what kind of data structure
are we using

196
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:05,840
are we using
 

197
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,030
are we using
oy cue or stack something

198
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:09,040
oy cue or stack something
 

199
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,149
oy cue or stack something
sorry something like hugo stack queue or

200
00:04:12,149 --> 00:04:12,159
sorry something like hugo stack queue or
 

201
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,589
sorry something like hugo stack queue or
stack which one

202
00:04:13,589 --> 00:04:13,599
stack which one
 

203
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,789
stack which one
i guess you're not guessing q or step

204
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:16,799
i guess you're not guessing q or step
 

205
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:19,270
i guess you're not guessing q or step
okay when we talk about the breakfast

206
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:19,280
okay when we talk about the breakfast
 

207
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,229
okay when we talk about the breakfast
search is

208
00:04:20,229 --> 00:04:20,239
search is
 

209
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:22,469
search is
one of them is one of my state one of

210
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:22,479
one of them is one of my state one of
 

211
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:23,749
one of them is one of my state one of
ladies q come on

212
00:04:23,749 --> 00:04:23,759
ladies q come on
 

213
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,629
ladies q come on
k q q first thing first of all q right

214
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:26,639
k q q first thing first of all q right
 

215
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,230
k q q first thing first of all q right
remember for the stack

216
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:28,240
remember for the stack
 

217
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,830
remember for the stack
we're using definite search but usually

218
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:29,840
we're using definite search but usually
 

219
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,749
we're using definite search but usually
we implement it in recursion

220
00:04:31,749 --> 00:04:31,759
we implement it in recursion
 

221
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,150
we implement it in recursion
and that involves the stack but it

222
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:34,160
and that involves the stack but it
 

223
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,189
and that involves the stack but it
doesn't have to

224
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:35,199
doesn't have to
 

225
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,350
doesn't have to
we don't have to deal with the stack

226
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:37,360
we don't have to deal with the stack
 

227
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,430
we don't have to deal with the stack
manually we can use the recursion

228
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:39,440
manually we can use the recursion
 

229
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,990
manually we can use the recursion
letter computer compiler to deal to

230
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,000
letter computer compiler to deal to
 

231
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,830
letter computer compiler to deal to
generate these calling stats right

232
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:43,840
generate these calling stats right
 

233
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,950
generate these calling stats right
okay yes so prefer search okay so we

234
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:46,960
okay yes so prefer search okay so we
 

235
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,749
okay yes so prefer search okay so we
have a queue

236
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:47,759
have a queue
 

237
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,790
have a queue
and first in q is first thing one

238
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:50,800
and first in q is first thing one
 

239
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,749
and first in q is first thing one
first thing first out okay so yeah

240
00:04:53,749 --> 00:04:53,759
first thing first out okay so yeah
 

241
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,749
first thing first out okay so yeah
exactly the kill luckily this q

242
00:04:56,749 --> 00:04:56,759
exactly the kill luckily this q
 

243
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:59,590
exactly the kill luckily this q
q-u-e-u-e yeah q is the only letter

244
00:04:59,590 --> 00:04:59,600
q-u-e-u-e yeah q is the only letter
 

245
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,350
q-u-e-u-e yeah q is the only letter
that's pronounced in this world

246
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:01,360
that's pronounced in this world
 

247
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,270
that's pronounced in this world
in this world yeah q and all other

248
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:03,280
in this world yeah q and all other
 

249
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,150
in this world yeah q and all other
letters are silent it means that the q

250
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:06,160
letters are silent it means that the q
 

251
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,590
letters are silent it means that the q
is being served only the head of the q

252
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:09,600
is being served only the head of the q
 

253
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,909
is being served only the head of the q
gets being served all others need to

254
00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:11,919
gets being served all others need to
 

255
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,350
gets being served all others need to
wait quietly right

256
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:13,360
wait quietly right
 

257
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,350
wait quietly right
and when the new element during the join

258
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:15,360
and when the new element during the join
 

259
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,390
and when the new element during the join
at the end when the q1 needs

260
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:18,400
at the end when the q1 needs
 

261
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,469
at the end when the q1 needs
when the next element to be served is

262
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:20,479
when the next element to be served is
 

263
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,070
when the next element to be served is
the head of the queue right

264
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:22,080
the head of the queue right
 

265
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,230
the head of the queue right
okay so at the beginning we want to

266
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:24,240
okay so at the beginning we want to
 

267
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,469
okay so at the beginning we want to
initialize the queue with which element

268
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:26,479
initialize the queue with which element
 

269
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,230
initialize the queue with which element
in the finance tree

270
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:30,240

 

271
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,390

which element in a binary tree if you

272
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:32,400
which element in a binary tree if you
 

273
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,430
which element in a binary tree if you
want to

274
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:33,440
want to
 

275
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,469
want to
do this implementation no but

276
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:36,479
do this implementation no but
 

277
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,550
do this implementation no but
look at the beginning the queue is empty

278
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:38,560
look at the beginning the queue is empty
 

279
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,749
look at the beginning the queue is empty
so wait

280
00:05:39,749 --> 00:05:39,759
so wait
 

281
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,670
so wait
look yeah we put the load which is one

282
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:41,680
look yeah we put the load which is one
 

283
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,909
look yeah we put the load which is one
right okay

284
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:43,919
right okay
 

285
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,950
right okay
and then we we repeat until the q is

286
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:46,960
and then we we repeat until the q is
 

287
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,430
and then we we repeat until the q is
empty

288
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:47,440
empty
 

289
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,310
empty
all right so every time if the q is not

290
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:50,320
all right so every time if the q is not
 

291
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,990
all right so every time if the q is not
empty what should we do we take one

292
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,000
empty what should we do we take one
 

293
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,189
empty what should we do we take one
element out of q yeah pq yeah

294
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:55,199
element out of q yeah pq yeah
 

295
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,029
element out of q yeah pq yeah
take it out and push its kids which is

296
00:05:59,029 --> 00:05:59,039
take it out and push its kids which is
 

297
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,990
take it out and push its kids which is
two and three two and three okay and

298
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:02,000
two and three two and three okay and
 

299
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,110
two and three two and three okay and
then next one

300
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:03,120
then next one
 

301
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,590
then next one
two take a two out the head of kill and

302
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:05,600
two take a two out the head of kill and
 

303
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,950
two take a two out the head of kill and
push is

304
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:06,960
push is
 

305
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,469
push is
kid six and he has one say

306
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:10,479
kid six and he has one say
 

307
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,230
kid six and he has one say
yeah i only have a one yeah so if in

308
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:12,240
yeah i only have a one yeah so if in
 

309
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,990
yeah i only have a one yeah so if in
order to put the yeah this is a perfect

310
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:14,000
order to put the yeah this is a perfect
 

311
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,350
order to put the yeah this is a perfect
source but in order to

312
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:15,360
source but in order to
 

313
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,550
source but in order to
tell which does it have a uh

314
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:18,560
tell which does it have a uh
 

315
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,469
tell which does it have a uh
does it is it only try we have to

316
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:22,479
does it is it only try we have to
 

317
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,550
does it is it only try we have to
recall the number of tried when we're

318
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:24,560
recall the number of tried when we're
 

319
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,870
recall the number of tried when we're
expanding right so for example

320
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:26,880
expanding right so for example
 

321
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,150
expanding right so for example
like three yeah i take three hours yeah

322
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:30,160
like three yeah i take three hours yeah
 

323
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,469
like three yeah i take three hours yeah
yeah when i take three out i push the

324
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:32,479
yeah when i take three out i push the
 

325
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,110
yeah when i take three out i push the
kids area at this point i know

326
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:35,120
kids area at this point i know
 

327
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,189
kids area at this point i know
how many kids the three has right it's

328
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:37,199
how many kids the three has right it's
 

329
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,550
how many kids the three has right it's
four and five right

330
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:38,560
four and five right
 

331
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,150
four and five right
all right yes so when i push the four

332
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:42,160

caught one kid
yeah when i push in the knife and also

348
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:55,840
yeah when i push in the knife and also
 

349
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,029
yeah when i push in the knife and also
notice is one

350
00:06:57,029 --> 00:06:57,039
notice is one
 

351
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,909
notice is one
so it looks like two yeah yeah look when

352
00:06:59,909 --> 00:06:59,919
so it looks like two yeah yeah look when
 

353
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,350
so it looks like two yeah yeah look when
i take a fall off

354
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:01,360
i take a fall off
 

355
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,589
i take a fall off
but i don't know it's it's coming from a

356
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:03,599
but i don't know it's it's coming from a
 

357
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,110
but i don't know it's it's coming from a
parent which has two kids

358
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:05,120
parent which has two kids
 

359
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,670
parent which has two kids
too right so i don't count this as the

360
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:07,680
too right so i don't count this as the
 

361
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,510
too right so i don't count this as the
only child right

362
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:09,520
only child right
 

363
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,629
only child right
yeah but i keep expanding four i push

364
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:12,639
yeah but i keep expanding four i push
 

365
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,430
yeah but i keep expanding four i push
the seven

366
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:13,440
the seven
 

367
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,629
the seven
in right i put the color seven here

368
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:16,639
in right i put the color seven here
 

369
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,029
in right i put the color seven here
but i also know when i put when i do

370
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:19,039
but i also know when i put when i do
 

371
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,670
but i also know when i put when i do
this

372
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:19,680
this
 

373
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,110
this
i know how many kids does

374
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:23,120
i know how many kids does
 

375
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,309
i know how many kids does
the four have one right yeah so i put

376
00:07:26,309 --> 00:07:26,319
the four have one right yeah so i put
 

377
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,749
the four have one right yeah so i put
when i push seven i also

378
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:27,759
when i push seven i also
 

379
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,110
when i push seven i also
notice this is coming from one

380
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:31,120
notice this is coming from one
 

381
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,710
notice this is coming from one
child's parent why are you okay

382
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:34,720
child's parent why are you okay
 

383
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,710
child's parent why are you okay
yeah you want to speed up

384
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:38,720
yeah you want to speed up
 

385
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,029
yeah you want to speed up
so one child one child parent so in this

386
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:41,039
so one child one child parent so in this
 

387
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,110
so one child one child parent so in this
case we're doing this we accumulated

388
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:43,120
case we're doing this we accumulated
 

389
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,670
case we're doing this we accumulated
yeah

390
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:43,680
yeah
 

391
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,909
yeah
yeah does that make sense yeah so let's

392
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:45,919
yeah does that make sense yeah so let's
 

393
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,309
yeah does that make sense yeah so let's
let's do this now

394
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:48,319
let's do this now
 

395
00:07:48,319 --> 00:08:07,030
let's do this now
let's do this okay

396
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:07,040

 

397
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,589

[Music]

398
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:09,599
[Music]
 

399
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,270
[Music]
okay so so

400
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:13,280
okay so so
 

401
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,909
okay so so
what what are the data structure we used

402
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:15,919
what what are the data structure we used
 

403
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,110
what what are the data structure we used
in python to implement a queue

404
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:19,120
in python to implement a queue
 

405
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,150
in python to implement a queue
dq and what's the q mean double

406
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:22,160
dq and what's the q mean double
 

407
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,670
dq and what's the q mean double
energy double ndq

408
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:25,680
energy double ndq
 

409
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,230
energy double ndq
double double and the cube okay so

410
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:30,240
double double and the cube okay so
 

411
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,430
double double and the cube okay so
so let's say let's at the beginning if

412
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:33,440
so let's say let's at the beginning if
 

413
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,070
so let's say let's at the beginning if
blue is

414
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:34,080
blue is
 

415
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,110
blue is
now what should we do return what

416
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:37,120
now what should we do return what
 

417
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,310
now what should we do return what
return

418
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:42,320

 

419
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,870

okay and then double cube ndq q equals

420
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:44,880
okay and then double cube ndq q equals
 

421
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,150
okay and then double cube ndq q equals
dq

422
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:46,160
dq
 

423
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,870
dq
and then we take a list of the initial

424
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:48,880
and then we take a list of the initial
 

425
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,630
and then we take a list of the initial
so at the beginning we take a two point

426
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:50,640
so at the beginning we take a two point
 

427
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,269
so at the beginning we take a two point
load

428
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:51,279
load
 

429
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,550
load
and we and we said the second element of

430
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:54,560
and we and we said the second element of
 

431
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,430
and we and we said the second element of
the tube area

432
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:55,440
the tube area
 

433
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,430
the tube area
is zero we mean that it coming from the

434
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:57,440
is zero we mean that it coming from the
 

435
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,470
is zero we mean that it coming from the
zero parent

436
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:58,480
zero parent
 

437
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,070
zero parent
animal the parent if it's one

438
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:02,080
animal the parent if it's one
 

439
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,910
animal the parent if it's one
it's coming from one child parent

440
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:05,920
it's coming from one child parent
 

441
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,710
it's coming from one child parent
if it's two it means coming from two

442
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:08,720
if it's two it means coming from two
 

443
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,750
if it's two it means coming from two
triangular right

444
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:09,760
triangular right
 

445
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,389
triangular right
yeah i don't need to call this answer

446
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:12,399
yeah i don't need to call this answer
 

447
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,070
yeah i don't need to call this answer
count

448
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:14,080
count
 

449
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,550
count
another equals zero

450
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:18,560

 

451
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,190

okay so look wire wire q

452
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:23,200
okay so look wire wire q
 

453
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,590
okay so look wire wire q
yeah y kill eric we want to dq

454
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:27,600
yeah y kill eric we want to dq
 

455
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,269
yeah y kill eric we want to dq
dq yeah so we only have a current now

456
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:31,279
dq yeah so we only have a current now
 

457
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:39,590
dq yeah so we only have a current now
another count count is the

458
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:39,600

 

459
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,310

this is a variable okay equals to q how

460
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:42,320
this is a variable okay equals to q how
 

461
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:42,710
this is a variable okay equals to q how
do we

462
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:42,720
do we
 

463
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,110
do we
kill q dot one pop one

464
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:47,120
kill q dot one pop one
 

465
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,990
kill q dot one pop one
i think left yeah left because with the

466
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:50,000
i think left yeah left because with the
 

467
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,910
i think left yeah left because with the
q we take it from the beginning which is

468
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:51,920
q we take it from the beginning which is
 

469
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,870
q we take it from the beginning which is
left yeah

470
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:52,880
left yeah
 

471
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,509
left yeah
yeah oh yeah and then because why this

472
00:09:55,509 --> 00:09:55,519
yeah oh yeah and then because why this
 

473
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,110
yeah oh yeah and then because why this
is this current because

474
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,120
is this current because
 

475
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,350
is this current because
look the first element is the low boost

476
00:09:59,350 --> 00:09:59,360
look the first element is the low boost
 

477
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,310
look the first element is the low boost
all right

478
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:00,320
all right
 

479
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,310
all right
the second element is the count right

480
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:02,320
the second element is the count right
 

481
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,150
the second element is the count right
yeah yeah

482
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:04,160
yeah yeah
 

483
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,750
yeah yeah
okay so now look if car if count

484
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:07,760
okay so now look if car if count
 

485
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,710
okay so now look if car if count
equals one what should we do it's coming

486
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:10,720
equals one what should we do it's coming
 

487
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,710
equals one what should we do it's coming
from one child parent so the current

488
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:12,720
from one child parent so the current
 

489
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,910
from one child parent so the current
note

490
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:13,920
note
 

491
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,550
note
is the one trial right only try yeah

492
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:16,560
is the one trial right only try yeah
 

493
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,030
is the one trial right only try yeah
yeah

494
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:17,040
yeah
 

495
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:22,150
yeah
so what should we do with this answer

496
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:22,160

 

497
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,430

answer

498
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:25,440

 

499
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,030

we found it so what should we do

500

look this answer is a zero yeah if we
 

681
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,829
look this answer is a zero yeah if we
can change it to

682
00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:27,839
can change it to
 

683
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,189
can change it to
every can change it to a list

684

every can change it to a list
 

685
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,430
every can change it to a list
and then instead of answer equals one

686
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:33,440
and then instead of answer equals one
 

687
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,470
and then instead of answer equals one
