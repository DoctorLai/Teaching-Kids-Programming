1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,309

hello hi hello mr are you all right

2
00:00:04,309 --> 00:00:04,319
hello hi hello mr are you all right
 

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:07,430
hello hi hello mr are you all right
yeah what's this binary tree

4
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:07,440
yeah what's this binary tree
 

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,230
yeah what's this binary tree
tree okay yeah good uh note a parent can

6
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:10,240
tree okay yeah good uh note a parent can
 

7
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:10,870
tree okay yeah good uh note a parent can
have uh

8
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:10,880
have uh
 

9
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,669
have uh
at most two child right i know with no

10
00:00:13,669 --> 00:00:13,679
at most two child right i know with no
 

11
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,270
at most two child right i know with no
child it's called leave

12
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:15,280
child it's called leave
 

13
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,349
child it's called leave
the note the only note yeah the only row

14
00:00:19,349 --> 00:00:19,359
the note the only note yeah the only row
 

15
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,830
the note the only note yeah the only row
a parent which is a room yeah yeah you

16
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:21,840
a parent which is a room yeah yeah you
 

17
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,029
a parent which is a room yeah yeah you
know what i

18
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:23,039
know what i
 

19
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,670
know what i
i was going to say okay so now i took

20
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:25,680
i was going to say okay so now i took
 

21
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,630
i was going to say okay so now i took
your line

22
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:26,640
your line
 

23
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,310
your line
yeah good so today's task is that if we

24
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:30,320
yeah good so today's task is that if we
 

25
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,349
yeah good so today's task is that if we
are allowed to pick

26
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:31,359
are allowed to pick
 

27
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,150
are allowed to pick
as many numbers as possible but given

28
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:34,160
as many numbers as possible but given
 

29
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,709
as many numbers as possible but given
this condition is that we can't pick

30
00:00:36,709 --> 00:00:36,719
this condition is that we can't pick
 

31
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,709
this condition is that we can't pick
we can't if we pick the parent we can

32
00:00:38,709 --> 00:00:38,719
we can't if we pick the parent we can
 

33
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,549
we can't if we pick the parent we can
pick its direct children or

34
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:40,559
pick its direct children or
 

35
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,030
pick its direct children or
if we pick the children we can pick the

36
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:43,040
if we pick the children we can pick the
 

37
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,150
if we pick the children we can pick the
direct parent

38
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:44,160
direct parent
 

39
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,190
direct parent
right so if we pick one yeah if we pick

40
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:47,200
right so if we pick one yeah if we pick
 

41
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,389
right so if we pick one yeah if we pick
one we can't pick two and

42
00:00:48,389 --> 00:00:48,399
one we can't pick two and
 

43
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,310
one we can't pick two and
if we pick two we can pick one and five

44
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:50,320
if we pick two we can pick one and five
 

45
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,430
if we pick two we can pick one and five
and six okay

46
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:51,440
and six okay
 

47
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,229
and six okay
so for example what's the maximum sum

48
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:54,239
so for example what's the maximum sum
 

49
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,670
so for example what's the maximum sum
that you can

50
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:55,680
that you can
 

51
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,310
that you can
you can get from picking as many numbers

52
00:00:58,310 --> 00:00:58,320
you can get from picking as many numbers
 

53
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,510
you can get from picking as many numbers
as possible

54
00:00:59,510 --> 00:00:59,520
as possible
 

55
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,349
as possible
what's um sum together

56
00:01:03,349 --> 00:01:03,359
what's um sum together
 

57
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,550
what's um sum together
what sum are we trying to add up to

58
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:06,560
what sum are we trying to add up to
 

59
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,310
what sum are we trying to add up to
yeah that's the question the number of

60
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:08,320
yeah that's the question the number of
 

61
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,990
yeah that's the question the number of
the the

62
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:10,000
the the
 

63
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,350
the the
sum the maximum sum that we can get

64
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:13,360
sum the maximum sum that we can get
 

65
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,670
sum the maximum sum that we can get
from picking the numbers from this minus

66
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:15,680
from picking the numbers from this minus
 

67
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,830
from picking the numbers from this minus
tree but only on one condition is that

68
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:17,840
tree but only on one condition is that
 

69
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,030
tree but only on one condition is that
we can't pick

70
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:19,040
we can't pick
 

71
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,870
we can't pick
the direct parent or the kids

72
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:22,880
the direct parent or the kids
 

73
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,870
the direct parent or the kids
okay so for example this one how what's

74
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:24,880
okay so for example this one how what's
 

75
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,030
okay so for example this one how what's
the sum you can get

76
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:27,040
the sum you can get
 

77
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,109
the sum you can get
what the sum the num the sum

78
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:31,119
what the sum the num the sum
 

79
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,310
what the sum the num the sum
come on the sun what's the matter

80
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:34,320
come on the sun what's the matter
 

81
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,749
come on the sun what's the matter
okay so um you can try

82
00:01:37,749 --> 00:01:37,759
okay so um you can try
 

83
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,630
okay so um you can try
coming up with a field three six five

84
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:40,640
coming up with a field three six five
 

85
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,230
coming up with a field three six five
three well done yeah six five three

86
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:42,240
three well done yeah six five three
 

87
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:42,630
three well done yeah six five three
that's

88
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:42,640
that's
 

89
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,910
that's
fourteen right right if we pick uh

90
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:45,920
fourteen right right if we pick uh
 

91
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,710
fourteen right right if we pick uh
two then we can pick one and five six

92
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:48,720
two then we can pick one and five six
 

93
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,429
two then we can pick one and five six
yeah then

94
00:01:49,429 --> 00:01:49,439
yeah then
 

95
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,510
yeah then
we can pick three that's five yeah yeah

96
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:51,520
we can pick three that's five yeah yeah
 

97
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,870
we can pick three that's five yeah yeah
if we pick one we can't

98
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:52,880
if we pick one we can't
 

99
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,550
if we pick one we can't
be stupid we can pick these two so it

100
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:54,560
be stupid we can pick these two so it
 

101
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,789
be stupid we can pick these two so it
will be one plus five plus six less

102
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:56,799
will be one plus five plus six less
 

103
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:57,670
will be one plus five plus six less
twelve right

104
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:57,680
twelve right
 

105
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,190
twelve right
still smaller than fourteen yeah we're

106
00:01:59,190 --> 00:01:59,200
still smaller than fourteen yeah we're
 

107
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,109
still smaller than fourteen yeah we're
done so 14 is the number

108
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:01,119
done so 14 is the number
 

109
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,550
done so 14 is the number
we're looking for so so you understand

110
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:04,560
we're looking for so so you understand
 

111
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,510
we're looking for so so you understand
this problem um

112
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:05,520
this problem um
 

113
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,830
this problem um
so how can we solve this problem i mean

114
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:09,840
so how can we solve this problem i mean
 

115
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,309
so how can we solve this problem i mean
proof of thing so proof of thing for

116
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:12,319
proof of thing so proof of thing for
 

117
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,869
proof of thing so proof of thing for
each one we can pick or not pick right

118
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:14,879
each one we can pick or not pick right
 

119
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,910
each one we can pick or not pick right
yeah yeah but so

120
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:17,920
yeah yeah but so
 

121
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,869
yeah yeah but so
proof of thing if this end is that n

122
00:02:20,869 --> 00:02:20,879
proof of thing if this end is that n
 

123
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:21,430
proof of thing if this end is that n
note

124
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:21,440
note
 

125
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,910
note
so how many possibilities are there for

126
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:23,920
so how many possibilities are there for
 

127
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,949
so how many possibilities are there for
each node we pick

128
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:24,959
each node we pick
 

129
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,589
each node we pick
two yeah we don't know o two to the

130
00:02:27,589 --> 00:02:27,599
two yeah we don't know o two to the
 

131
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:27,990
two yeah we don't know o two to the
power

132
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:28,000
power
 

133
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,869
power
m so but about this solution two to the

134
00:02:30,869 --> 00:02:30,879
m so but about this solution two to the
 

135
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:31,589
m so but about this solution two to the
power of n

136
00:02:31,589 --> 00:02:31,599
power of n
 

137
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,390
power of n
we need to filter out those in valid

138
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:34,400
we need to filter out those in valid
 

139
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,070
we need to filter out those in valid
solutions yeah inverted solutions

140
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:36,080
solutions yeah inverted solutions
 

141
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,750
solutions yeah inverted solutions
meaning that if we pick one we complete

142
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:37,760
meaning that if we pick one we complete
 

143
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,110
meaning that if we pick one we complete
these two everywhere

144
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:39,120
these two everywhere
 

145
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,309
these two everywhere
one two without and just kidding no no

146
00:02:42,309 --> 00:02:42,319
one two without and just kidding no no
 

147
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,070
one two without and just kidding no no
so so but first of all we need to

148
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:44,080
so so but first of all we need to
 

149
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,150
so so but first of all we need to
generate this much uh this many

150
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:46,160
generate this much uh this many
 

151
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,030
generate this much uh this many
this much solutions right and then we

152
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,040
this much solutions right and then we
 

153
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,630
this much solutions right and then we
need to filter out

154
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:50,640
need to filter out
 

155
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,710
need to filter out
filter outlet loads inverted solution

156
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:52,720
filter outlet loads inverted solution
 

157
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,150
filter outlet loads inverted solution
and then we need to compute

158
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:54,160
and then we need to compute
 

159
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,790
and then we need to compute
the sum right computer sum usually takes

160
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:56,800
the sum right computer sum usually takes
 

161
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,589
the sum right computer sum usually takes
n so the time complexity will be

162
00:02:59,589 --> 00:02:59,599
n so the time complexity will be
 

163
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,630
n so the time complexity will be
o 2 to the power n times n right this is

164
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:02,640
o 2 to the power n times n right this is
 

165
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,630
o 2 to the power n times n right this is
too much got it

166
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:04,640
too much got it
 

167
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,309
too much got it
this is too much yeah am right

168
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:08,319
this is too much yeah am right
 

169
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,190
this is too much yeah am right
yeah the problem with this solution is

170
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:11,200
yeah the problem with this solution is
 

171
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:11,910
yeah the problem with this solution is
that

172
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:11,920
that
 

173
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,430
that
if we pick these we don't need to pick

174
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:15,440
if we pick these we don't need to pick
 

175
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,350
if we pick these we don't need to pick
we know we don't need to try picking

176
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:17,360
we know we don't need to try picking
 

177
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,830
we know we don't need to try picking
these yeah these would be a lot of

178
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:19,840
these yeah these would be a lot of
 

179
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,630
these yeah these would be a lot of
duplicate inverted solutions right so

180
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:22,640
duplicate inverted solutions right so
 

181
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,110
duplicate inverted solutions right so
far

182
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,120
far
 

183
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,270
far
is for each note how many for each note

184
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:27,280
is for each note how many for each note
 

185
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,910
is for each note how many for each note
we have two choices yeah all right we

186
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:29,920
we have two choices yeah all right we
 

187
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,390
we have two choices yeah all right we
can pick on a pick yeah okay

188
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:32,400
can pick on a pick yeah okay
 

189
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,710
can pick on a pick yeah okay
we cannot pick or not pick so if we can

190
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:34,720
we cannot pick or not pick so if we can
 

191
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,670
we cannot pick or not pick so if we can
do this

192
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:35,680
do this
 

193
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,149
do this
you know we can define the function

194
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:38,159
you know we can define the function
 

195
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,430
you know we can define the function
define the function okay

196
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:39,440
define the function okay
 

197
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,830
define the function okay
let's let's define a function

198
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:44,840

 

199
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,070

define

200
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:46,080
define
 

201
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,630
define
so uh let's say pick

202
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:50,640
so uh let's say pick
 

203
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,830
so uh let's say pick
okay so we have a loot but if we tell

204
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:53,840
okay so we have a loot but if we tell
 

205
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,070
okay so we have a loot but if we tell
him we add a second perimeter saying

206
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:56,080
him we add a second perimeter saying
 

207
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,830
him we add a second perimeter saying
if we need to pick or not taken let's

208
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:57,840
if we need to pick or not taken let's
 

209
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,270
if we need to pick or not taken let's
say we want to take

210
00:03:59,270 --> 00:03:59,280
say we want to take
 

211
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,429
say we want to take
uh let's say to take okay to take

212
00:04:03,429 --> 00:04:03,439
uh let's say to take okay to take
 

213
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,110
uh let's say to take okay to take
to take color okay

214
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:07,120
to take color okay
 

215
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,149
to take color okay
if loot is now what happens if it's

216
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:10,159
if loot is now what happens if it's
 

217
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,830
if loot is now what happens if it's
empty what should we do

218
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:11,840
empty what should we do
 

219
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:18,870
empty what should we do
return what

220
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:18,880

 

221
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,550

okay now if we to take okay if this note

222
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:22,560
okay now if we to take okay if this note
 

223
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,469
okay now if we to take okay if this note
we are saying to take

224
00:04:26,469 --> 00:04:26,479

 

225
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,950

if we take look eric look this is the

226
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:28,960
if we take look eric look this is the
 

227
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,749
if we take look eric look this is the
tree okay

228
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:29,759
tree okay
 

229
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,590
tree okay
this this note we are currently here

230
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:31,600
this this note we are currently here
 

231
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,150
this this note we are currently here
root yeah this is good

232
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:34,160
root yeah this is good
 

233
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,510
root yeah this is good
if we do to take so we need to return

234
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:37,520
if we do to take so we need to return
 

235
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:37,909
if we do to take so we need to return
what

236
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:37,919
what
 

237
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,749
what
we turn this new dot value yeah all

238
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:39,759
we turn this new dot value yeah all
 

239
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,230
we turn this new dot value yeah all
right because we are taking this okay

240
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:42,240
right because we are taking this okay
 

241
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,629
right because we are taking this okay
all right we are taking this but if we

242
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:44,639
all right we are taking this but if we
 

243
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,790
all right we are taking this but if we
take these we can't take these two right

244
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:46,800
take these we can't take these two right
 

245
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,070
take these we can't take these two right
i'm right yeah so

246
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,080
i'm right yeah so
 

247
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,430
i'm right yeah so
what should we do we can play a password

248
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:55,440

 

249
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,990

all right plus one look if we take this

250
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,000
all right plus one look if we take this
 

251
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,469
all right plus one look if we take this
root

252
00:04:58,469 --> 00:04:58,479
root
 

253
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,390
root
at least is what this is loot on left

254
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:00,400
at least is what this is loot on left
 

255
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,590
at least is what this is loot on left
right

256
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:01,600
right
 

257
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,430
right
unless it's rule okay so look

258
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:07,440

 

259
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,590

if we take this right if we take these

260
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:11,600
if we take this right if we take these
 

261
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,670
if we take this right if we take these
if this function if we take down we

262
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:13,680
if this function if we take down we
 

263
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,790
if this function if we take down we
can't take

264
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:14,800
can't take
 

265
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,230
can't take
that's right so this function will

266
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:16,240
that's right so this function will
 

267
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,550
that's right so this function will
return the maximum value if we take

268
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:18,560
return the maximum value if we take
 

269
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,710
return the maximum value if we take
these current load right so if we take

270
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:20,720
these current load right so if we take
 

271
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,870
these current load right so if we take
this root we obviously we need to take

272
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:22,880
this root we obviously we need to take
 

273
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,270
this root we obviously we need to take
this

274
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:23,280
this
 

275
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,270
this
value right class ready plus pick

276
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:27,280
value right class ready plus pick
 

277
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:34,950
value right class ready plus pick
pick one rule download the second

278
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:34,960
pick one rule download the second
 

279
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,710
pick one rule download the second
parameter from left

280
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:36,720
parameter from left
 

281
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:50,070
parameter from left
read

282
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:50,080

 

283
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,590

and what with that

284
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:53,600
and what with that
 

285
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,830
and what with that
false yeah let's that's why yeah but if

286
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:55,840
false yeah let's that's why yeah but if
 

287
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,950
false yeah let's that's why yeah but if
we're not taking look

288
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:56,960
we're not taking look
 

289
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,510
we're not taking look
it's not taking it's not taking

290
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:01,520
it's not taking it's not taking
 

291
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,230
it's not taking it's not taking
if we don't take this one right we can't

292
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:04,240
if we don't take this one right we can't
 

293
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,749
if we don't take this one right we can't
take greed or left

294
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:05,759
take greed or left
 

295
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,309
take greed or left
we can take these and we can also not

296
00:06:08,309 --> 00:06:08,319
we can take these and we can also not
 

297
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,430
we can take these and we can also not
take this right

298
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:09,440
take this right
 

299
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,710
take this right
am right does this make sense

300
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:12,720
am right does this make sense
 

301
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,110
am right does this make sense
so look for the left we can take or not

302
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:15,120
so look for the left we can take or not
 

303
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,350
so look for the left we can take or not
take for the right we can take another

304
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:17,360
take for the right we can take another
 

305
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,029
take for the right we can take another
how many possibilities all together

306
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:21,039
how many possibilities all together
 

307
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,790
how many possibilities all together
so the left we can two

308
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:24,800
so the left we can two
 

309
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,550
so the left we can two
two and then this is two possibilities

310
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:26,560
two and then this is two possibilities
 

311
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,990
two and then this is two possibilities
so how many all together

312
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:28,000
so how many all together
 

313
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,309
so how many all together
on the left like we can take or not take

314
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:30,319
on the left like we can take or not take
 

315
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,189
on the left like we can take or not take
yeah

316
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:31,199
yeah
 

317
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,230
yeah
two times two so we can pick

318
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:34,240
two times two so we can pick
 

319
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,950
two times two so we can pick
okay i'm going to write this yeah all

320
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:36,960
okay i'm going to write this yeah all
 

321
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,230
okay i'm going to write this yeah all
right

322
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:38,240
right
 

323
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,909
right
so take blue dot

324
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:41,919
so take blue dot
 

325
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,830
so take blue dot
left we pick loose

326
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:46,840
left we pick loose
 

327
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,230
left we pick loose
left

328
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:48,240
left

two right plus
 

331
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,430
two right plus
very quick plus pick on left uh okay i

332
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:55,440
very quick plus pick on left uh okay i
 

333
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:55,990
very quick plus pick on left uh okay i
don't have

334
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,000
don't have
 

335
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,469
don't have
enough space so basically look we want

336
00:06:58,469 --> 00:06:58,479
enough space so basically look we want
 

337
00:06:58,479 --> 00:06:59,990
enough space so basically look we want
to get this maximum of

338
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,000
to get this maximum of
 

339
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,710
to get this maximum of
these four choices maximum of leads we

340
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:02,720
these four choices maximum of leads we
 

341
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,670
these four choices maximum of leads we
pick

342
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:03,680
pick
 

343
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,790
pick
we pick the left and pick the right

344
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:06,800
we pick the left and pick the right
 

345
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,430
we pick the left and pick the right
right will be true right two two oh we

346
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:09,440
right will be true right two two oh we
 

347
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,309
right will be true right two two oh we
kick the left

348
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:10,319
kick the left
 

349
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,070
kick the left
these are the left left left left and

350
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:12,080
these are the left left left left and
 

351
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,790
these are the left left left left and
left i i just right left left

352
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:14,800
left i i just right left left
 

353
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,350
left i i just right left left
left and here another function is right

354
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:17,360
left and here another function is right
 

355
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,189
left and here another function is right
yeah

356
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:19,199
yeah
 

357
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,469
yeah
so look so basically we pick two

358
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:22,479
so look so basically we pick two
 

359
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,589
so look so basically we pick two
two left that we pick both left

360
00:07:25,589 --> 00:07:25,599
two left that we pick both left
 

361
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,510
two left that we pick both left
and right pick a left don't pick it

362
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:27,520
and right pick a left don't pick it
 

363
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,110
and right pick a left don't pick it
right

364
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:29,120
right
 

365
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,189
right
don't pick the left pick it right and

366
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:31,199
don't pick the left pick it right and
 

367
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,629
don't pick the left pick it right and
don't pick it

368
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:32,639
don't pick it
 

369
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,710
don't pick it
both left and right and we want to get

370
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:34,720
both left and right and we want to get
 

371
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,029
both left and right and we want to get
the maximum of these right okay

372
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:37,039
the maximum of these right okay
 

373
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,309
the maximum of these right okay
yeah doesn't make sense pick

374
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:40,319
yeah doesn't make sense pick
 

375
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,270
yeah doesn't make sense pick
pick so you have a big pic pick no on

376
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:43,280
pick so you have a big pic pick no on
 

377
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,070
pick so you have a big pic pick no on
left to pick

378
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,080
left to pick
 

379
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,270
left to pick
rudolph right to pick noodle left

380
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:47,280
rudolph right to pick noodle left
 

381
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,390
rudolph right to pick noodle left
uh to pick a little right first pick

382
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:50,400
uh to pick a little right first pick
 

383
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,110
uh to pick a little right first pick
do the left first pick do the right tool

384
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:53,120
do the left first pick do the right tool
 

385
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,710
do the left first pick do the right tool
and it wasn't

386
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:54,720
and it wasn't
 

387
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,430
and it wasn't
the last one pick root on left

388
00:07:59,430 --> 00:07:59,440
the last one pick root on left
 

389
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,869
the last one pick root on left
yeah okay so for each one we we're going

390
00:08:02,869 --> 00:08:02,879
yeah okay so for each one we we're going
 

391
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,469
yeah okay so for each one we we're going
this peak route so

392
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:04,479
this peak route so
 

393
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:05,990
this peak route so
what's the time complexity for this one

394
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:06,000
what's the time complexity for this one
 

395
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,510
what's the time complexity for this one
tricky

396
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:07,520
tricky
 

397
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,430
tricky
and there's something missing there's a

398
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:09,440
and there's something missing there's a
 

399
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,869
and there's something missing there's a
word missing

400
00:08:10,869 --> 00:08:10,879
word missing
 

401
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,070
word missing
what's that cash you add on cash if you

402
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:14,080
what's that cash you add on cash if you
 

403
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,390
what's that cash you add on cash if you
don't

404
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:14,400
don't
 

405
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,430
don't
put a cash that'll be every time you go

406
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:17,440
put a cash that'll be every time you go
 

407
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,309
put a cash that'll be every time you go
to release

408
00:08:18,309 --> 00:08:18,319
to release
 

409
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,629
to release
you you'll cut you compute over and over

410
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:20,639
you you'll cut you compute over and over
 

411
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,469
you you'll cut you compute over and over
again right for each rule right

412
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:22,479
again right for each rule right
 

413
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,589
again right for each rule right
am i yeah so if we put a cash in that

414
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:25,599
am i yeah so if we put a cash in that
 

415
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,110
am i yeah so if we put a cash in that
that's right what's the time complexity

416
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:27,120
that's right what's the time complexity
 

417
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,589
that's right what's the time complexity
after

418
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:27,599
after
 

419
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:32,709
after
putting the cash

420
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:32,719

 

421
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,990

because for each node we only compute

422
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:36,000
because for each node we only compute
 

423
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,949
because for each node we only compute
two states peak on a peak right so

424
00:08:38,949 --> 00:08:38,959
two states peak on a peak right so
 

425
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:40,149
two states peak on a peak right so
actually it's two times

426
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:40,159
actually it's two times
 

427
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,949
actually it's two times
o two f but we drop the constant is o n

428
00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:42,959
o two f but we drop the constant is o n
 

429
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:43,350
o two f but we drop the constant is o n
right

430
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:43,360
right
 

431
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,030
right
all right yeah yeah

432
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,040
all right yeah yeah
 

433
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,670
all right yeah yeah
does it make sense yeah look if we know

434
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:49,680
does it make sense yeah look if we know
 

435
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,509
does it make sense yeah look if we know
doing cash what happened if we don't

436
00:08:51,509 --> 00:08:51,519
doing cash what happened if we don't
 

437
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:59,350
doing cash what happened if we don't
do the cash

438
00:08:59,350 --> 00:08:59,360

 

439
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,509

so if we don't do the cash but

440
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:03,519

 

441
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,630

at some point yeah at some point

442
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:06,640
at some point yeah at some point
 

443
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,710
at some point yeah at some point
we're going to calculate these we we're

444
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:08,720
we're going to calculate these we we're
 

445
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,070
we're going to calculate these we we're
going to calculate one

446
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:10,080
going to calculate one
 

447
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,509
going to calculate one
stage over and over again right okay

448
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:13,519
stage over and over again right okay
 

449
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,190
stage over and over again right okay
yeah so what's the maximum what's the

450
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:17,200
yeah so what's the maximum what's the
 

451
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,590
yeah so what's the maximum what's the
what's the value we need to return peak

452
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:19,600
what's the value we need to return peak
 

453
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,150
what's the value we need to return peak
low maximum

454
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:22,160
low maximum
 

455
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,509
low maximum
maximum one because at the beginning

456
00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:25,519
maximum one because at the beginning
 

457
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,389
maximum one because at the beginning
we need to return maximum repeat route

458
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:28,399
we need to return maximum repeat route
 

459
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:28,790
we need to return maximum repeat route
take

460
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:28,800
take
 

461
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,389
take
true oh

462
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:32,399

 

463
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,389

so well pick pick room two or one

464
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:36,399
so well pick pick room two or one
 

465
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,710
so well pick pick room two or one
and pick blue first with the maximum

466
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:38,720
and pick blue first with the maximum
 

467
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,389
and pick blue first with the maximum
yeah at the root of the time

468
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:40,399
yeah at the root of the time
 

469
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,550
yeah at the root of the time
so if we pick these or not pick these

470
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:42,560
so if we pick these or not pick these
 

471
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,590
so if we pick these or not pick these
right

472
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:43,600
right
 

473
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,550
right
yeah if we pick this if we pick these

474
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:48,560
yeah if we pick this if we pick these
 

475
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,470
yeah if we pick this if we pick these
we don't pick these to it and you'll

476
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:50,480
we don't pick these to it and you'll
 

477
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,310
we don't pick these to it and you'll
call these two functions here right

478
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:52,320
call these two functions here right
 

479
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,030
call these two functions here right
yeah if we don't take these and then

480
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:55,040
yeah if we don't take these and then
 

481
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,389
yeah if we don't take these and then
these two values are

482
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:56,399
these two values are
 

483
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,150
these two values are
are calculating again right so that's

484
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:58,160
are calculating again right so that's
 

485
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,750
are calculating again right so that's
why we need to do the patch

486
00:09:59,750 --> 00:09:59,760
why we need to do the patch
 

487
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,310
why we need to do the patch
at least it's what top down or butter up

488
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:04,320
at least it's what top down or butter up
 

489
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,710
at least it's what top down or butter up
yeah because we want to take it at least

490
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:06,720
yeah because we want to take it at least
 

491
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,509
yeah because we want to take it at least
then because

492
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:07,519
then because
 

493
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,670
then because
we will need leads to leave and that

494
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:09,680
we will need leads to leave and that
 

495
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,190
we will need leads to leave and that
will be tucked down let's that's why we

496
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:11,200
will be tucked down let's that's why we
 

497
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,710
will be tucked down let's that's why we
need to put a catch stop down

498
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:12,720
need to put a catch stop down
 

499
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,470
need to put a catch stop down
so can we do this butter up maybe we

500
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:16,480
so can we do this butter up maybe we
 

501
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,870
so can we do this butter up maybe we
can yeah so butterfly is that we

502
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:18,880
can yeah so butterfly is that we
 

503
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,310
can yeah so butterfly is that we
calculate from these

504
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:20,320
calculate from these
 

505
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,110
calculate from these
all right from the leaves to the root

506
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:23,120
all right from the leaves to the root
 

507
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,710
all right from the leaves to the root
yeah from the leaves to the root

508
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:24,720
yeah from the leaves to the root
 

509
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,670
yeah from the leaves to the root
so for each note if we can return two

510
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:27,680
so for each note if we can return two
 

511
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,470
so for each note if we can return two
states

512
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:28,480
states
 

513
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,069
states
if we take these or not take these right

514
00:10:32,069 --> 00:10:32,079
if we take these or not take these right
 

515
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,470
if we take these or not take these right
all right so for each load we can only

516
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:34,480
all right so for each load we can only
 

517
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,110
all right so for each load we can only
we can

518
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:35,120
we can
 

519
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,350
we can
take this one and take this okay so

520
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:37,360
take this one and take this okay so
 

521
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:44,790
take this one and take this okay so
let's do this

522
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:44,800

 

523
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,829

define let's call it uh dp okay

524
00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:47,839
define let's call it uh dp okay
 

525
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,389
define let's call it uh dp okay
dp load so but we don't need to

526
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:50,399
dp load so but we don't need to
 

527
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,150
dp load so but we don't need to
parameters yeah so

528
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:52,160
parameters yeah so
 

529
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,430
parameters yeah so
if not load if not load if

530
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:55,440
if not load if not load if
 

531
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,990
if not load if not load if
it's empty we return to value

532
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,000
it's empty we return to value
 

533
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,990
it's empty we return to value
zero zero look this is a cube with

534
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:02,000
zero zero look this is a cube with
 

535
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,430
zero zero look this is a cube with
return two values zero

536
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:03,440
return two values zero
 

537
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,110
return two values zero
in python you can return two values

538
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:05,120
in python you can return two values
 

539
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,030
in python you can return two values
using the columns or multiple values

540
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:07,040
using the columns or multiple values
 

541
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,590
using the columns or multiple values
yeah

542
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:07,600
yeah
 

543
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,190
yeah
this is called tuple we return two

544
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:09,200
this is called tuple we return two
 

545
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,630
this is called tuple we return two
values

546
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:10,640
values
 

547
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,910
values
okay now we take left let's say take a

548
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:13,920
okay now we take left let's say take a
 

549
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,310
okay now we take left let's say take a
left

550
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:14,320
left
 

551
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,829
left
look take left

552
00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:17,839

 

553
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,110

not take a left okay we can do this

554
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:21,120
not take a left okay we can do this
 

555
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,630
not take a left okay we can do this
this is taking so this the first value

556
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:24,640
this is taking so this the first value
 

557
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,150
this is taking so this the first value
is that if we take this

558
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:26,160
is that if we take this
 

559
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,550
is that if we take this
taken the current note the maximum value

560
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:28,560
taken the current note the maximum value
 

561
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,670
taken the current note the maximum value
we can get

562
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:29,680
we can get
 

563
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,269
we can get
the second value is that if we don't

564
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:31,279
the second value is that if we don't
 

565
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,269
the second value is that if we don't
take this note the maximum value we can

566
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:33,279
take this note the maximum value we can
 

567
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,389
take this note the maximum value we can
get yeah

568
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:34,399
get yeah
 

569
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,110
get yeah
from this note yeah from this final tree

570
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:37,120
from this note yeah from this final tree
 

571
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,910
from this note yeah from this final tree
am i

572
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:37,920
am i
 

573
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,630
am i
yeah okay look so here

574
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:42,640
yeah okay look so here
 

575
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,110
yeah okay look so here
is that we take these notes eric hey

576
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:45,120
is that we take these notes eric hey
 

577
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,389
is that we take these notes eric hey
look look at me

578
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:46,399
look look at me
 

579
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,430
look look at me
if we take this note the maximum value

580
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:49,440
if we take this note the maximum value
 

581
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,389
if we take this note the maximum value
we can get

582
00:11:50,389 --> 00:11:50,399
we can get
 

583
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,790
we can get
from this subtree yeah if we don't take

584
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:52,800
from this subtree yeah if we don't take
 

585
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,750
from this subtree yeah if we don't take
this no

586
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:53,760
this no
 

587
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,150
this no
the maximum value we can get so take

588
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:56,160
the maximum value we can get so take
 

589
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,110
the maximum value we can get so take
left not take

590
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:57,120
left not take
 

591
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,829
left not take
left equal as dp wow

592
00:12:01,829 --> 00:12:01,839
left equal as dp wow
 

593
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,550
left equal as dp wow
what what should i put here take left

594
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:04,560
what what should i put here take left
 

595
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,150
what what should i put here take left
not take that equals dp this is

596
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:06,160
not take that equals dp this is
 

597
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:06,870
not take that equals dp this is
recursion

598
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:06,880
recursion
 

599
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:18,629
recursion
right because can you tell me what

600
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:18,639

 

601
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,230

because look we haven't solved this

602
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:20,240
because look we haven't solved this
 

603
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,310
because look we haven't solved this
problem yet but we are

604
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:22,320
problem yet but we are
 

605
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,670
problem yet but we are
dedicating using i uh recursion

606
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:25,680
dedicating using i uh recursion
 

607
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,949
dedicating using i uh recursion
to delete it to delay this calculation

608
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:28,959
to delete it to delay this calculation
 

609
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:29,829
to delete it to delay this calculation
recursively

610
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:29,839
recursively
 

611
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,550
recursively
until it reaches the root right which is

612
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:32,560
until it reaches the root right which is
 

613
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:32,949
until it reaches the root right which is
the

614
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:32,959
the
 

615
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,990
the
leaves which is zero zero right okay

616
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:36,000
leaves which is zero zero right okay
 

617
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,230
leaves which is zero zero right okay
and again here take a right

618
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:40,240

 

619
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,790

not take the right

620
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:44,800

 

621
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,340

equals one ppy

622
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:47,350
equals one ppy
 

623
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,629
equals one ppy
[Music]

624
00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:48,639
[Music]
 

625
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,470
[Music]
yeah okay now this is the best part

626
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:52,480
yeah okay now this is the best part
 

627
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,389
yeah okay now this is the best part
so now we have to take left to not take

628
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:54,399
so now we have to take left to not take
 

629
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,310
so now we have to take left to not take
a left take right not take

630
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:56,320
a left take right not take
 

631
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,509
a left take right not take
right okay so look we now

632
00:12:59,509 --> 00:12:59,519
right okay so look we now
 

633
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,550
right okay so look we now
we so here okay so

634
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:02,560
we so here okay so
 

635
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,069
we so here okay so
this is the loop yeah we are here at

636
00:13:04,069 --> 00:13:04,079
this is the loop yeah we are here at
 

637
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,710
this is the loop yeah we are here at
this one this is the loot

638
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:06,720
this one this is the loot
 

639
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,509
this one this is the loot
so now we're calling the dp do the left

640
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:09,519
so now we're calling the dp do the left
 

641
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,269
so now we're calling the dp do the left
to the right so for these two bit

642
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:11,279
to the right so for these two bit
 

643
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,069
to the right so for these two bit
absolutely

644
00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:12,079
absolutely
 

645
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,190
absolutely
this will be has four values right this

646
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:15,200
this will be has four values right this
 

647
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,230
this will be has four values right this
has four values

648
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:16,240
has four values
 

649
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,389
has four values
so for this node for this value if we

650
00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:18,399
so for this node for this value if we
 

651
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:19,670
so for this node for this value if we
take it

652
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:19,680
take it
 

653
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,230
take it
if we take it all right so the first

654
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:22,240
if we take it all right so the first
 

655
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,350
if we take it all right so the first
value we want to take it

656
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:23,360
value we want to take it
 

657
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,710
value we want to take it
take take take

658
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:26,720
take take take
 

659
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,350
take take take
boot okay take root equals what if we

660
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:29,360
boot okay take root equals what if we
 

661
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:29,750
boot okay take root equals what if we
take

662
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:29,760
take
 

663
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,150
take
the root if we take it

664
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:34,160
the root if we take it
 

665
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,509
the root if we take it
we we can't take these two right yeah

666
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:37,519
we we can't take these two right yeah
 

667
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,269
we we can't take these two right yeah
so what should we what's that what

668
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:39,279
so what should we what's that what
 

669
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,870
so what should we what's that what
should be the value of take note

670
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:42,880

 

671
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,710

what should the value of take load

672
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:46,720

 

673
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,750

take we we can't take so which value

674
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:49,760
take we we can't take so which value
 

675
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,910
take we we can't take so which value
which two values if we take these which

676
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:51,920
which two values if we take these which
 

677
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,189
which two values if we take these which
two values are

678
00:13:53,189 --> 00:13:53,199
two values are
 

679
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,389
two values are
which these are therefore valid

680
00:13:56,389 --> 00:13:56,399
which these are therefore valid
 

681
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,870
which these are therefore valid
not take right yeah not take less

682
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:00,880
not take right yeah not take less
 

683
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,710
not take right yeah not take less
plus not take right right yeah

684
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:04,720
plus not take right right yeah
 

685
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,310
plus not take right right yeah
yeah okay now if we not take a look

686
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:08,320
yeah okay now if we not take a look
 

687
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,509
yeah okay now if we not take a look
not take a look because

688
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:11,519
not take a look because
 

689
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:16,949
not take a look because
even left add take flight

690
00:14:16,949 --> 00:14:16,959
even left add take flight
 

691
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,150
even left add take flight
sorry what does it mean no no no if

692
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:20,160
sorry what does it mean no no no if
 

693
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,590
sorry what does it mean no no no if
we're not taking the loot how many

694
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:21,600
we're not taking the loot how many
 

695
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,189
we're not taking the loot how many
possibilities we can

696
00:14:23,189 --> 00:14:23,199
possibilities we can
 

697
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,230
possibilities we can
we we can 2

698
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:26,240
we we can 2
 

699
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,590
we we can 2
9 4. okay so if we don't take this we

700
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:29,600
9 4. okay so if we don't take this we
 

701
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:29,990
9 4. okay so if we don't take this we
can take

702
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,000
can take
 

703
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,230
can take
these or not take these and we can take

704
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:32,240
these or not take these and we can take
 

705
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,670
these or not take these and we can take
these or not take this

706
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:33,680
these or not take this
 

707
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,030
these or not take this
right yeah so if we don't take these

708
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:37,040
right yeah so if we don't take these
 

709
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,750
right yeah so if we don't take these
we can take this or not take this which

710
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:39,760
we can take this or not take this which
 

711
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,189
we can take this or not take this which
which one

712
00:14:41,189 --> 00:14:41,199
which one
 

713
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,150
which one
the maximum we will pick is right all

714
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:44,160
the maximum we will pick is right all
 

715
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:44,870
the maximum we will pick is right all
right

716
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:44,880
right
 

717
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,430
right
yeah so that would be what maximum of

718
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:47,440
yeah so that would be what maximum of
 

719
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,550
yeah so that would be what maximum of
what

720
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:48,560
what
 

721
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,990
what
maximum work plus maximum one

722
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:52,000
maximum work plus maximum one
 

723
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,350
maximum work plus maximum one
can you can you continue maximum water

724
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:55,360
can you can you continue maximum water
 

725
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:05,189
can you can you continue maximum water
maximum

726
00:15:05,189 --> 00:15:05,199

 

727
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,870

right okay wait wait a minute take a

728
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:08,880
right okay wait wait a minute take a
 

729
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,430
right okay wait wait a minute take a
look

730
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:09,440
look
 

731
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,150
look
we can we take root we cannot take left

732
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:12,160
we can we take root we cannot take left
 

733
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:12,629
we can we take root we cannot take left
or

734
00:15:12,629 --> 00:15:12,639
or
 

735
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,870
or
not take it right and plus load of value

736
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:14,880
not take it right and plus load of value
 

737
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,030
not take it right and plus load of value
yeah because we already take it yeah

738
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:17,040
yeah because we already take it yeah
 

739
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,150
yeah because we already take it yeah
so this is missing yeah okay

740
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:20,160
so this is missing yeah okay
 

741
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,310
so this is missing yeah okay
so not take a look if we don't take

742
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:22,320
so not take a look if we don't take
 

743
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,829
so not take a look if we don't take
these we want to

744
00:15:23,829 --> 00:15:23,839
these we want to
 

745
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,110
these we want to
pick the maximum of two solutions on

746
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:27,120
pick the maximum of two solutions on
 

747
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,389
pick the maximum of two solutions on
each side so this is

748
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:28,399
each side so this is
 

749
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,550
each side so this is
we can say here will be take left

750
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:32,560
we can say here will be take left
 

751
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,670
we can say here will be take left
and not take left there yeah take

752
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:35,680
and not take left there yeah take
 

753
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:50,389
and not take left there yeah take
left not take that and then yeah

754
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:50,399

 

755
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,490

which two values we are returning here

756
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:55,500
which two values we are returning here
 

757
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:00,949
which two values we are returning here
[Music]

758
00:16:00,949 --> 00:16:00,959

 

759
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,949

no we already calculated the first value

760
00:16:02,949 --> 00:16:02,959
no we already calculated the first value
 

761
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,790
no we already calculated the first value
is we take it and the second value is we

762
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:04,800
is we take it and the second value is we
 

763
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,389
is we take it and the second value is we
don't take it and for the load we

764
00:16:06,389 --> 00:16:06,399
don't take it and for the load we
 

765
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,350
don't take it and for the load we
already know

766
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:07,360
already know
 

767
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,870
already know
take a look and not take it low so what

768
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:08,880
take a look and not take it low so what
 

769
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,590
take a look and not take it low so what
should we do 10

770
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:11,600

 

771
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,150

pay yeah and comma

772
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:16,160
pay yeah and comma
 

773
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,269
pay yeah and comma
note yeah not take so now we are solving

774
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:19,279
note yeah not take so now we are solving
 

775
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,230
note yeah not take so now we are solving
the cases for for current rule yeah

776
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:22,240
the cases for for current rule yeah
 

777
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,150
the cases for for current rule yeah
based on if we take this look look

778
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:24,160
based on if we take this look look
 

779
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,310
based on if we take this look look
if we take this root we can't take these

780
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:26,320
if we take this root we can't take these
 

781
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,310
if we take this root we can't take these
two loose so these two values we already

782
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:28,320
two loose so these two values we already
 

783
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,990
two loose so these two values we already
calculated from recursion

784
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:30,000
calculated from recursion
 

785
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,829
calculated from recursion
but if we don't take these two loose we

786
00:16:31,829 --> 00:16:31,839
but if we don't take these two loose we
 

787
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,590
but if we don't take these two loose we
plus the current value a lot of value

788
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:33,600
plus the current value a lot of value
 

789
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:33,910
plus the current value a lot of value
yeah

790
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:33,920
yeah
 

791
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,110
yeah
but if we're not taking the route then

792
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:37,120
but if we're not taking the route then
 

793
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,389
but if we're not taking the route then
we can try we can take the left

794
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:40,399
we can try we can take the left
 

795
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,389
we can try we can take the left
and not take the left plus take the

796
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:42,399
and not take the left plus take the
 

797
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,710
and not take the left plus take the
right and not pla

798
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:44,720
right and not pla
 

799
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,670
right and not pla
not take the right right am right yeah

800
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:47,680
not take the right right am right yeah
 

801
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,829
not take the right right am right yeah
so

802
00:16:48,829 --> 00:16:48,839
so
 

803
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,590
so
so i don't know if this take

804
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:51,600
so i don't know if this take
 

805
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,749
so i don't know if this take
right take a left there are two

806
00:16:53,749 --> 00:16:53,759
right take a left there are two
 

807
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,670
right take a left there are two
solutions they either take these or not

808
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:55,680
solutions they either take these or not
 

809
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,470
solutions they either take these or not
take these

810
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:56,480
take these
 

811
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,990
take these
and here is either take these on the

812
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:58,000
and here is either take these on the
 

813
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,629
and here is either take these on the
tables but we can only pick one right so

814
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:00,639
tables but we can only pick one right so
 

815
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,269
tables but we can only pick one right so
it will be the maximum of two choices

816
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:03,279
it will be the maximum of two choices
 

817
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,309
it will be the maximum of two choices
and then return we need to add at the

818
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:06,319
and then return we need to add at the
 

819
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,710
and then return we need to add at the
end we need to return dp

820
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:08,720
end we need to return dp
 

821
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,029
end we need to return dp
here uh dp load the maximum of dp rule

822
00:17:13,029 --> 00:17:13,039
here uh dp load the maximum of dp rule
 

823
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,029
here uh dp load the maximum of dp rule
yeah so we'll return maximum of

824
00:17:15,029 --> 00:17:15,039
yeah so we'll return maximum of
 

825
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,870
yeah so we'll return maximum of
dp load right because it should we take

826
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:16,880
dp load right because it should we take
 

827
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,549
dp load right because it should we take
two values but

828
00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:18,559
two values but
 

829
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,949
two values but
for the root value we have two choice we

830
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:20,959
for the root value we have two choice we
 

831
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,630
for the root value we have two choice we
take we pick or not pick

832
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:22,640
take we pick or not pick
 

833
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,630
take we pick or not pick
and then we want to return the maximum

834
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:24,640
and then we want to return the maximum
 

835
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,390
and then we want to return the maximum
right yeah

836
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:26,400
right yeah
 

837
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,230
right yeah
this one is butter our top down

838
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:30,240
this one is butter our top down
 

839
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,430
this one is butter our top down
butter because we we are look we these

840
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:33,440
butter because we we are look we these
 

841
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,990
butter because we we are look we these
two locations we are delaying until the

842
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:36,000
two locations we are delaying until the
 

843
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,950
two locations we are delaying until the
bottom and once at the bottom the leaf

00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:40,240
we know
 

847
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,590
we know
uh the empty node we know the values and

848
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:43,600
uh the empty node we know the values and
 

849
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,870
uh the empty node we know the values and
we're building up the

850
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:44,880
we're building up the
 

851
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,029
we're building up the
dp values from the leaves to the loop

852
00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:47,039
dp values from the leaves to the loop
 

853
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,950
dp values from the leaves to the loop
okay so let's bottom up dp

854
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:48,960
okay so let's bottom up dp
 

855
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,190
okay so let's bottom up dp

oh and yes because because for each

888
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:26,080
oh and yes because because for each
 

889
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,909
oh and yes because because for each
value we are we are we are traveling

890
00:18:27,909 --> 00:18:27,919
value we are we are we are traveling
 

891
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:29,590
value we are we are we are traveling
only once from the bottom up yeah for

892
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:29,600
only once from the bottom up yeah for
 

893
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,190
only once from the bottom up yeah for
each note we

894
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:31,200
each note we
 

895
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,909
each note we
need to calculate two values take it or

896
00:18:33,909 --> 00:18:33,919
need to calculate two values take it or
 

897
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,990
need to calculate two values take it or
not take it am i right

898
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:36,000
not take it am i right
 

899
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,630
not take it am i right
yes and then because look we take it

900
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:38,640
yes and then because look we take it
 

901
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,150
yes and then because look we take it
don't take it

902
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:40,160
don't take it
 

903
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,470
don't take it
this note we just need to to

904
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:44,480
this note we just need to to
 

905
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,270
this note we just need to to
this node can calculation needs to based

906
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:47,280
this node can calculation needs to based
 

907
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,470
this node can calculation needs to based
on the

908
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:48,480
on the
 

909
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,830
on the
two four values of its left and right

910
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:51,840
two four values of its left and right
 

911
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,230
two four values of its left and right
right

912
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:52,240
right
 

913
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,470
right
it doesn't care other values because

914
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:54,480
it doesn't care other values because
 

915
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,350
it doesn't care other values because
these are values

916
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:57,360
these are values
 

917
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,870
these are values
already don't directly affect these two

918
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:00,880
already don't directly affect these two
 

919
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,750
already don't directly affect these two
right it's already

920
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:01,760
right it's already
 

921
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,270
right it's already
there right it's the it's a it take left

922
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:05,280
there right it's the it's a it take left
 

923
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,029
there right it's the it's a it take left
take right now take left don't tell what

924
00:19:07,029 --> 00:19:07,039
take right now take left don't tell what
 

925
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,070
take right now take left don't tell what
is the immediate is

926
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:08,080
is the immediate is
 

927
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,430
is the immediate is
its value is there right so we already

928
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:11,440
its value is there right so we already
 

929
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:11,909
its value is there right so we already
know

930
00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:11,919
know
 

931
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,470
know
right am right does it make sense

932
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:16,480

 

933

i'm ready you ready
okay which speed you can you don't ready

940
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:34,640
okay which speed you can you don't ready
 

941
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,150
okay which speed you can you don't ready
okay i'm going to take this just this

942
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:38,160
okay i'm going to take this just this
 

943
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,669
okay i'm going to take this just this
take a look can you write a take a

944
00:19:39,669 --> 00:19:39,679
take a look can you write a take a
 

945
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,430
take a look can you write a take a
little part

946
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:41,440
little part
 

947
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,510
little part
take a look take a little equals one

948
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:45,520
take a look take a little equals one
 

949
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,510
take a look take a little equals one
take a look if i take this value

950
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:49,520

 

951
00:19:49,520 --> 00:20:10,780

if i take this

952
