what kind of data structure can allow us

266
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:51,520
what kind of data structure can allow us
 

267
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,510
what kind of data structure can allow us
to keep it unique yes it said yeah we

268
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:53,520
to keep it unique yes it said yeah we
 

269
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,189
to keep it unique yes it said yeah we
use the set key there but first of all

270
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:55,199
use the set key there but first of all
 

271
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,990
use the set key there but first of all
we need to um

272
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,000

 

273
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,110

now the filter of the the labels the

274
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:03,120
now the filter of the the labels the
 

275
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,589
now the filter of the the labels the
labels and we get rid of the dots right
