1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,310

hello hello hi

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:02,320
hello hello hi
 

3
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,789
hello hello hi
we're gonna have a break time

4
00:00:04,789 --> 00:00:04,799
we're gonna have a break time
 

5
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,150
we're gonna have a break time
everybody

6
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:06,160
everybody
 

7
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,629
everybody
so today we talk about the dopamine okay

8
00:00:08,629 --> 00:00:08,639
so today we talk about the dopamine okay
 

9
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,110
so today we talk about the dopamine okay
so that's the mathematics uh concept

10
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:11,120
so that's the mathematics uh concept
 

11
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,990
so that's the mathematics uh concept
applies to vectors so we use the array

12
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:14,000
applies to vectors so we use the array
 

13
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,310
applies to vectors so we use the array
array is list as a vector yeah you know

14
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:16,320
array is list as a vector yeah you know
 

15
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,189
array is list as a vector yeah you know
the vector what's better what's vector

16
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:19,199
the vector what's better what's vector
 

17
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,790
the vector what's better what's vector
what's better

18
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:20,800
what's better
 

19
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,230
what's better
can you tell me what's vector well

20
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:24,240
can you tell me what's vector well
 

21
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,470
can you tell me what's vector well
vector yeah something like that we use

22
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:26,480
vector yeah something like that we use
 

23
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,710
vector yeah something like that we use
that it says highest

24
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:28,720
that it says highest
 

25
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,390
that it says highest
what's call it magnitude

26
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:30,400
what's call it magnitude
 

27
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,830
what's call it magnitude
and direction

28
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:31,840
and direction
 

29
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,830
and direction
okay we'll come back to this concept but

30
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:33,840
okay we'll come back to this concept but
 

31
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,870
okay we'll come back to this concept but
as far as

32
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:34,880
as far as
 

33
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,430
as far as
uh what we can know here is that

34
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:39,440
uh what we can know here is that
 

35
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,910
uh what we can know here is that
the vectors it can be represented by

36
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:41,920
the vectors it can be represented by
 

37
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,709
the vectors it can be represented by
arrays list so we want to compute the

38
00:00:44,709 --> 00:00:44,719
arrays list so we want to compute the
 

39
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,549
arrays list so we want to compute the
dot products for the two

40
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:46,559
dot products for the two
 

41
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,869
dot products for the two
dot products so we will use one a times

42
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:48,879
dot products so we will use one a times
 

43
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,069
dot products so we will use one a times
b okay

44
00:00:50,069 --> 00:00:50,079
b okay
 

45
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,350
b okay
okay

46
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:51,360
okay
 

47
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,430
okay
look using this single dot

48
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:53,440
look using this single dot
 

49
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,110
look using this single dot
so what does it

50
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:55,120
so what does it
 

51
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,389
so what does it
equal

52
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:56,399
equal
 

53
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,590
equal
it equals will give me give us a

54
00:00:59,590 --> 00:00:59,600
it equals will give me give us a
 

55
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,270
it equals will give me give us a
value

56
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:01,280
value
 

57
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,590
value
right it's not a list of values so

58
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:03,600
right it's not a list of values so
 

59
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,590
right it's not a list of values so
so what is it

60
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:05,600
so what is it
 

61
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,429
so what is it
equals to the sum

62
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:07,439
equals to the sum
 

63
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,469
equals to the sum
the sum

64
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:08,479
the sum
 

65
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:09,670
the sum
okay

66
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:09,680
okay
 

67
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,870
okay
sum of let's say this these uh the

68
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:12,880
sum of let's say this these uh the
 

69
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,109
sum of let's say this these uh the
number of elements in both elements are

70
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:15,119
number of elements in both elements are
 

71
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,710
number of elements in both elements are
arrays are n right

72
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:16,720
arrays are n right
 

73
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,950
arrays are n right
so equals i equals 0 to n minus 1

74
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:20,960
so equals i equals 0 to n minus 1
 

75
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,190
so equals i equals 0 to n minus 1
sum of a

76
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:23,200
sum of a
 

77
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,390
sum of a
i

78
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:24,400
i
 

79
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,350
i
times bi

80
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:27,360
times bi
 

81
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,350
times bi
okay so based on this can you give me

82
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:29,360
okay so based on this can you give me
 

83
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,270
okay so based on this can you give me
the answer for the product of a and b

84
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:31,280
the answer for the product of a and b
 

85
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,710
the answer for the product of a and b
come on

86
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:32,720
come on
 

87
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,830
come on
come on

88
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:33,840
come on
 

89
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,230
come on
well it is

90
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:36,240
well it is
 

91
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,990
well it is
come on it needs to be easier a i times

92
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:38,000
come on it needs to be easier a i times
 

93
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,670
come on it needs to be easier a i times
bi and some i'll take that a i comes bi

94
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:41,680
bi and some i'll take that a i comes bi
 

95
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,590
bi and some i'll take that a i comes bi
so what's the answer

96
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:43,600
so what's the answer
 

97
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,789
so what's the answer
one times four plus two times five

98
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:46,799
one times four plus two times five
 

99
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,030
one times four plus two times five
plus three times six

100
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:49,040
plus three times six
 

101
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:59,670
plus three times six
um wait it is um four ten fourteen and

102
00:01:59,670 --> 00:01:59,680

 

103
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,510

applies to two vectors of the same

104
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:01,520
applies to two vectors of the same
 

105
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,550
applies to two vectors of the same
length

106
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:02,560
length
 

107
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,270
length
and then we all we have to do is to sum

108
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:05,280
and then we all we have to do is to sum
 

109
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,109
and then we all we have to do is to sum
up the each

110
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:07,119
up the each
 

111
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,669
up the each
corresponding pair one four two five

112
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:09,679
corresponding pair one four two five
 

113
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,510
corresponding pair one four two five
three six right

114
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:11,520
three six right
 

115
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,510
three six right
yeah and if it doesn't have an equal

116
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:13,520
yeah and if it doesn't have an equal
 

117
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,430
yeah and if it doesn't have an equal
length then you we can't apply this

118
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:15,440
length then you we can't apply this
 

119
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,270
length then you we can't apply this
right it only applies percentage if

120
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:17,280
right it only applies percentage if
 

121
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,030
right it only applies percentage if
another one is there

122
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:19,040
another one is there
 

123
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,150
another one is there
for these two

124
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:20,160
for these two
 

125
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,229
for these two
no no because there's no subnet can we

126
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:22,239
no no because there's no subnet can we
 

127
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,430
no no because there's no subnet can we
just like seven plus nothing separately

128
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:25,440
just like seven plus nothing separately
 

129
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,270
just like seven plus nothing separately
no no no no

130
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:27,280
no no no no
 

131
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,110
no no no no
you have it has to be the same same

132
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:29,120
you have it has to be the same same
 

133
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,309
you have it has to be the same same
length for two

134
00:02:30,309 --> 00:02:30,319
length for two
 

135
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,309
length for two
two okay

136
00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:32,319
two okay
 

137
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,949
two okay
so to understand this sum from i to zero

138
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:34,959
so to understand this sum from i to zero
 

139
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,390
so to understand this sum from i to zero
to n minus n minus one a i times d i and

140
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:38,400
to n minus n minus one a i times d i and
 

141
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,229
to n minus n minus one a i times d i and
we want the sum of these

142
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:40,239
we want the sum of these
 

143
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,350
we want the sum of these
all right

144
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:41,360
all right
 

145
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,470
all right
correct

146
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:42,480
correct
 

147
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,470
correct
how can we implement it

148
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:44,480
how can we implement it
 

149
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,150
how can we implement it
easier

150
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:46,160
easier
 

151
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,350
easier
define

152
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:47,360
define
 

153
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,790
define
dot product

154
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:48,800
dot product
 

155
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,070
dot product
a

156
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:50,080
a
 

157
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,990
a
first of all what do we do what do we

158
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,000
first of all what do we do what do we
 

159
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,190
first of all what do we do what do we
need to do

160
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:53,200
need to do
 

161
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,190
need to do
we need to find out the length right

162
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:55,200
we need to find out the length right
 

163
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,070
we need to find out the length right
yeah so what's the length

164
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:58,080
yeah so what's the length
 

165
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,990
yeah so what's the length
and equation

166
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:00,000
and equation
 

167
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,830
and equation
length what

168
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:01,840
length what
 

169
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,630
length what
that's what

170
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:06,640

 

171
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,030

but we also have to check if b is the

172
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:09,040
but we also have to check if b is the
 

173
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,630
but we also have to check if b is the
same as n right so we can use the

174
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:10,640
same as n right so we can use the
 

175
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,390
same as n right so we can use the
function called assert what what does it

176
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:12,400
function called assert what what does it
 

177
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,589
function called assert what what does it
mean by answer

178
00:03:13,589 --> 00:03:13,599
mean by answer
 

179
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,869
mean by answer
what does this mean a assertion

180
00:03:15,869 --> 00:03:15,879
what does this mean a assertion
 

181
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:19,509
what does this mean a assertion
a-s-s-e-r-t assert

182
00:03:19,509 --> 00:03:19,519

 

183
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,190

what's his name

184
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:21,200
what's his name
 

185
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,509
what's his name
in english

186
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:23,519
in english
 

187
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,030
in english
you know

188
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,040
you know
 

189
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,710
you know
you don't know let's find other means

190
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:26,720
you don't know let's find other means
 

191
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,309
you don't know let's find other means
that

192
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:28,319
that
 

193
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,830
that
to make sure right to guarantee to do to

194
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:31,840
to make sure right to guarantee to do to
 

195
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,270
to make sure right to guarantee to do to
make sure yeah

196
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:33,280
make sure yeah
 

197
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,110
make sure yeah
okay so we need to make sure n equal

198
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:35,120
okay so we need to make sure n equal
 

199
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,750
okay so we need to make sure n equal
equal length what b okay it has to be

200
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:37,760
equal length what b okay it has to be
 

201
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,270
equal length what b okay it has to be
the same length right

202
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:39,280
the same length right
 

203
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,789
the same length right
okay

204
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:40,799
okay
 

205
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,030
okay
so you wrap it out

206
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:43,040
so you wrap it out
 

207
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,309
so you wrap it out
so what happens if this does not satisfy

208
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:46,319
so what happens if this does not satisfy
 

209
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,270
so what happens if this does not satisfy
if n is not equal if the length of a is

210
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:49,280
if n is not equal if the length of a is
 

211
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,789
if n is not equal if the length of a is
not

212
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:50,799
not
 

213
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,350
not
the computer will just you know scream

214
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:53,360
the computer will just you know scream
 

215
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,750
the computer will just you know scream
okay you screen your your screen at this

216
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:55,760
okay you screen your your screen at this
 

217
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,429
okay you screen your your screen at this
point it will tell you okay and it's not

218
00:03:57,429 --> 00:03:57,439
point it will tell you okay and it's not
 

219
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,670
point it will tell you okay and it's not
equal students b and then and it will

220
00:03:59,670 --> 00:03:59,680
equal students b and then and it will
 

221
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,910
equal students b and then and it will
refuse to continue okay so that's the

222
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:01,920
refuse to continue okay so that's the
 

223
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,550
refuse to continue okay so that's the
way to make sure that after this we

224
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:04,560
way to make sure that after this we
 

225
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,229
way to make sure that after this we
don't need to worry about if we are not

226
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:06,239
don't need to worry about if we are not
 

227
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,949
don't need to worry about if we are not
the same length right right how can you

228
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:08,959
the same length right right how can you
 

229
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,190
the same length right right how can you
compute the screen just print an arrow

230
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:11,200
compute the screen just print an arrow
 

231
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,949
compute the screen just print an arrow
saying okay i don't like what you're

232
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:12,959
saying okay i don't like what you're
 

233
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,270
saying okay i don't like what you're
doing here because you tell me okay f is

234
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:15,280
doing here because you tell me okay f is
 

235
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,030
doing here because you tell me okay f is
equal to length b but what i thought we

236
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:17,040
equal to length b but what i thought we
 

237
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,870
equal to length b but what i thought we
i found out is that n is not equal to

238
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:18,880
i found out is that n is not equal to
 

239
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,110
i found out is that n is not equal to
then b then last i cannot continue

240
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:21,120
then b then last i cannot continue
 

241
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,230
then b then last i cannot continue
that's what basically it does here okay

242
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:24,240
that's what basically it does here okay
 

243
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,150
that's what basically it does here okay
okay so now we want to return a value

244
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:26,160
okay so now we want to return a value
 

245
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,469
okay so now we want to return a value
which is at the beginning equals one

246
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:30,479
which is at the beginning equals one
 

247
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,070
which is at the beginning equals one
come on we don't sum up the beginning

248
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,080
come on we don't sum up the beginning
 

249
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,350
come on we don't sum up the beginning
right

250
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:33,360
right
 

251
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,110
right
what value

252
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:35,120
what value
 

253
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,629
what value
in the beginning

254
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:36,639
in the beginning
 

255
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,749
in the beginning
no no no the sum there

256
00:04:38,749 --> 00:04:38,759
no no no the sum there
 

257
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:41,270
no no no the sum there
is a value

258
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:41,280
is a value
 

259
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,670
is a value
we want to sum up the beginning what's

260
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:43,680
we want to sum up the beginning what's
 

261
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,550
we want to sum up the beginning what's
the sum

262
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:44,560
the sum
 

263
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,749
the sum
it's nothing so what do we give it

264
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:47,759
it's nothing so what do we give it
 

265
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,749
it's nothing so what do we give it
zero come on

266
00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:49,759
zero come on
 

267
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,469
zero come on
four zero is nothing yeah there is

268
00:04:52,469 --> 00:04:52,479
four zero is nothing yeah there is
 

269
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:57,890
four zero is nothing yeah there is
nothing okay for i in range

remember the difference
 

291
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,070
remember the difference
we talked about this

292
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:50,080
we talked about this
 

293
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,189
we talked about this
like one two three four

294
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:53,199
like one two three four
 

295
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,029
like one two three four
and then this is a

296
00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:55,039
and then this is a
 

297
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,469
and then this is a
b is

298
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:56,479
b is
 

299
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,350
b is
five six seven eight so

300
00:05:59,350 --> 00:05:59,360
five six seven eight so
 

301
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,629
five six seven eight so
so what what's g for a b

302
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:02,639
so what what's g for a b
 

303
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:08,150
so what what's g for a b
what's the ap you know what's cheap

304
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,160

 

305
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,390

yeah yeah so i have a here i have b here

306
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:10,400
yeah yeah so i have a here i have b here
 

307
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,110
yeah yeah so i have a here i have b here
chips so what happened

308
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:13,120
chips so what happened
 

309
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,469
chips so what happened
one five two six three seven four five

310
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:16,479
one five two six three seven four five
 

311
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,710
one five two six three seven four five
and we also have a cheap longest if it's

312
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:18,720
and we also have a cheap longest if it's
 

313
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,390
and we also have a cheap longest if it's
different length

314
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:20,400
different length
 

315
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,150
different length
yeah if there's a nine here then you can

316
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:22,160
yeah if there's a nine here then you can
 

317
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,469
yeah if there's a nine here then you can
use the deep left uh longest but and

318
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:24,479
use the deep left uh longest but and
 

319
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,870
use the deep left uh longest but and
then this one will be

320
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:26,880
then this one will be
 

321
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,950
then this one will be
filled with number okay

322
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:28,960
filled with number okay
 

323
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,189
filled with number okay
we mentioned that before yeah so chip a

324
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:31,199
we mentioned that before yeah so chip a
 

325
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,150
we mentioned that before yeah so chip a
b

326
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:32,160
b
 

327
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,309
b
so if chip a b it will return a list of

328
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:34,319
so if chip a b it will return a list of
 

329
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,150
so if chip a b it will return a list of
two players so you become like right

330
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:36,160
two players so you become like right
 

331
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,150
two players so you become like right
right one four

332
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:38,160
right one four
 

333
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,870
right one four
one two five yeah

334
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:40,880
one two five yeah
 

335
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,350
one two five yeah
something like that it's three six yeah

336
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:43,360
something like that it's three six yeah
 

337
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,830
something like that it's three six yeah
okay so we can use this

338
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:45,840
okay so we can use this
 

339
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:51,189
okay so we can use this
look

340
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:51,199

 

341
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,150

we can just do this sum

342
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:54,160
we can just do this sum
 

343
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,110
we can just do this sum
okay somewhat x zero

344
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:57,120
okay somewhat x zero
 

345
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,830
okay somewhat x zero
times x one

346
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:00,840

 

347
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,350

four x

348
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:03,360
four x
 

349
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,150
four x
in

350
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:04,160
in
 

351
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,430
in
zip

352
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:05,440
zip
 

353
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,950
zip
what

354
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:06,960
what
 

355
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,550
what
come on using guess

356
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:08,560
come on using guess
 

357
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,309
come on using guess
sum x x what's s x instead yeah

358
00:07:12,309 --> 00:07:12,319
sum x x what's s x instead yeah
 

359
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,189
sum x x what's s x instead yeah
x is a cube yeah yeah yeah look chip a b

360
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:15,199
x is a cube yeah yeah yeah look chip a b
 

361
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,909
x is a cube yeah yeah yeah look chip a b
look one two three

362
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:17,919
look one two three
 

363
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,510
look one two three
and then if i chip with four five six

364
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:21,520
and then if i chip with four five six
 

365
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,150
and then if i chip with four five six
so what does what do we get

366
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:24,160
so what does what do we get
 

367
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,230
so what does what do we get
one four this is a two four yeah

368
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:26,240
one four this is a two four yeah
 

369
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,150
one four this is a two four yeah
two five

370
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:28,160
two five
 

371
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,710
two five
three six yeah what's x x is this one so

372
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:32,720
three six yeah what's x x is this one so
 

373
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,670
three six yeah what's x x is this one so
x is this tube x yellow is here right

374
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:35,680
x is this tube x yellow is here right
 

375
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,430
x is this tube x yellow is here right
this is x zero

376
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:37,440
this is x zero
 

377
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,309
this is x zero
this is x one right i want to sum up x

378
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:40,319
this is x one right i want to sum up x
 

379
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,110
this is x one right i want to sum up x
zero times x one which is one times four

380
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:43,120
zero times x one which is one times four
 

381
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,710
zero times x one which is one times four
2 times 5

382
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:44,720
2 times 5
 

383
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,110
2 times 5
3 times 6 and i also add it together

384
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:47,120
3 times 6 and i also add it together
 

385
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,589
3 times 6 and i also add it together
some using the sum function so this is

386
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:49,599
some using the sum function so this is
 

387
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,430
some using the sum function so this is
quite fancy yeah okay

388
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:53,440

 

389
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,589

okay so i'm going to erase this and you

390
00:07:55,589 --> 00:07:55,599
okay so i'm going to erase this and you
 

391
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,510
okay so i'm going to erase this and you
need to implement one of it

392
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:57,520
need to implement one of it
 

393
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,589
need to implement one of it
oh come on you can use the implement

394
00:07:59,589 --> 00:07:59,599
oh come on you can use the implement
 

395
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,270
oh come on you can use the implement
first anything
