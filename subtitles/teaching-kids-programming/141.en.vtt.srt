1
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:05,670

friday yeah good

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:05,680
friday yeah good
 

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,070
friday yeah good
good it's friday okay so today we talk

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:08,080
good it's friday okay so today we talk
 

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,070
good it's friday okay so today we talk
about a problem which is called set

6
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:10,080
about a problem which is called set
 

7
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,990
about a problem which is called set
split set split we want to

8
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:14,000
split set split we want to
 

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,150
split set split we want to
so given a list of numbers yeah this is

10
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:16,160
so given a list of numbers yeah this is
 

11
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,109
so given a list of numbers yeah this is
the number like

12
00:00:17,109 --> 00:00:17,119
the number like
 

13
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:20,870
the number like
four nine five okay okay

14
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:20,880
four nine five okay okay
 

15
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,349
four nine five okay okay
let's read numbers uh okay so this is a

16
00:00:23,349 --> 00:00:23,359
let's read numbers uh okay so this is a
 

17
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,429
let's read numbers uh okay so this is a
set of numbers we want to find out if

18
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:25,439
set of numbers we want to find out if
 

19
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,189
set of numbers we want to find out if
it's possible to split

20
00:00:27,189 --> 00:00:27,199
it's possible to split
 

21
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,230
it's possible to split
the numbers into two groups okay so two

22
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:30,240
the numbers into two groups okay so two
 

23
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,029
the numbers into two groups okay so two
groups

24
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:31,039
groups
 

25
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,110
groups
each group should have at least one

26
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:33,120
each group should have at least one
 

27
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,549
each group should have at least one
number okay it cannot be

28
00:00:34,549 --> 00:00:34,559
number okay it cannot be
 

29
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,190
number okay it cannot be
an empty group yeah doesn't make sense

30
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:37,200
an empty group yeah doesn't make sense
 

31
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,150
an empty group yeah doesn't make sense
so two groups

32
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:40,160

 

33
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,869

and first requirement second requirement

34
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:42,879
and first requirement second requirement
 

35
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:43,510
and first requirement second requirement
is

36
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:43,520
is
 

37
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,630
is
the sum of both groups are equal

38
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:46,640
the sum of both groups are equal
 

39
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:53,029
the sum of both groups are equal
some of each group some of those groups

40
00:00:53,029 --> 00:00:53,039

 

41
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,750

and a third requirement says one group

42
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:55,760
and a third requirement says one group
 

43
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,750
and a third requirement says one group
the numbers in one group are strictly

44
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:57,760
the numbers in one group are strictly
 

45
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,069
the numbers in one group are strictly
smaller than the other groups

46
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:00,079
smaller than the other groups
 

47
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,229
smaller than the other groups
one group one group numbers

48
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:04,239
one group one group numbers
 

49
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,310
one group one group numbers
strictly smaller strictly smaller than

50
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:06,320
strictly smaller strictly smaller than
 

51
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,590
strictly smaller strictly smaller than
another okay

52
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:07,600
another okay
 

53
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,510
another okay
so for example i can split this into two

54
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:09,520
so for example i can split this into two
 

55
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,030
so for example i can split this into two
groups four five

56
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:11,040
groups four five
 

57
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,990
groups four five
and nine four plus five equals nine

58
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:14,000
and nine four plus five equals nine
 

59
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,630
and nine four plus five equals nine
another good

60
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:14,640
another good
 

61
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,230
another good
yeah the second okay and four and five

62
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:18,240
yeah the second okay and four and five
 

63
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,550
yeah the second okay and four and five
are strictly smaller than nine okay so

64
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:20,560
are strictly smaller than nine okay so
 

65
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,749
are strictly smaller than nine okay so
can we do this with nine and nine

66
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:23,759
can we do this with nine and nine
 

67
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,310
can we do this with nine and nine
can we do this can we split it into two

68
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:26,320
can we do this can we split it into two
 

69
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:26,789
can we do this can we split it into two
groups

70
00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:26,799
groups
 

71
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,830
groups
no why is that because

72
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:29,840
no why is that because
 

73
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,630
no why is that because
no essay and it can be three and nine

74
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:32,640
no essay and it can be three and nine
 

75
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,109
no essay and it can be three and nine
and nine

76
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:33,119
and nine
 

77
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,390
and nine
and nine is not quickly well done good

78
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:36,400
and nine is not quickly well done good
 

79
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:36,789
and nine is not quickly well done good
job

80
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:36,799
job
 

81
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,149
job
okay so so how can we do this so can we

82
00:01:40,149 --> 00:01:40,159
okay so so how can we do this so can we
 

83
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,710
okay so so how can we do this so can we
find a way to do this how how can we

84
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:42,720
find a way to do this how how can we
 

85
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,749
find a way to do this how how can we
do this

86
00:01:45,749 --> 00:01:45,759

 

87
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,710

very important yes how can we prove

88
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:48,720
very important yes how can we prove
 

89
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,510
very important yes how can we prove
something

90
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:49,520
something
 

91
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:57,910
something
how can you prove us how can we prove us

92
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:57,920

 

93
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,350

so the blue forcing would be picking the

94
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:01,360
so the blue forcing would be picking the
 

95
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,389
so the blue forcing would be picking the
numbers

96
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:02,399
numbers
 

97
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,749
numbers
of one group right picking the numbers

98
00:02:05,749 --> 00:02:05,759
of one group right picking the numbers
 

99
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,429
of one group right picking the numbers
of one group

100
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:07,439
of one group
 

101
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,389
of one group
so for each number we can try to pick in

102
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:10,399
so for each number we can try to pick in
 

103
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,869
so for each number we can try to pick in
one group or not pick one proof right

104
00:02:12,869 --> 00:02:12,879
one group or not pick one proof right
 

105
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,510
one group or not pick one proof right
right so eventually these will be in two

106
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:15,520
right so eventually these will be in two
 

107
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,150
right so eventually these will be in two
groups a

108
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:16,160
groups a
 

109
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,430
groups a
and b so if we decide the numbers to put

110
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:19,440
and b so if we decide the numbers to put
 

111
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:19,990
and b so if we decide the numbers to put
in

112
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:20,000
in
 

113
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,430
in
a then we also mean that we have numbers

114
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:23,440
a then we also mean that we have numbers
 

115
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:23,990
a then we also mean that we have numbers
in b

116
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:24,000
in b
 

117
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,430
in b
right all right so this number

118
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:27,440
right all right so this number
 

119
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,990
right all right so this number
i can have two choice the next number i

120
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,000
i can have two choice the next number i
 

121
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,350
i can have two choice the next number i
can also have two choice

122
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:31,360
can also have two choice
 

123
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,830
can also have two choice
if there are n numbers how many choice

124
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:33,840
if there are n numbers how many choice
 

125
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,270
if there are n numbers how many choice
do i have i have two choice i have two

126
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:37,280
do i have i have two choice i have two
 

127
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,710
do i have i have two choice i have two
choice i have two choice so

128
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:38,720
choice i have two choice so
 

129
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,390
choice i have two choice so
for n numbers how many choices do i have

130
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:42,400
for n numbers how many choices do i have
 

131
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,750
for n numbers how many choices do i have
n times two to the power of n

132
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:45,760
n times two to the power of n
 

133
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,509
n times two to the power of n
right because two times two times two

134
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:47,519
right because two times two times two
 

135
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,350
right because two times two times two
right yes

136
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:49,360
right yes
 

137
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,470
right yes
so this is the number of ways to spin

138
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:52,480
so this is the number of ways to spin
 

139
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,990
so this is the number of ways to spin
the groups

140
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:54,000
the groups
 

141
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,910
the groups
and then we also need to find out if

142
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:55,920
and then we also need to find out if
 

143
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,670
and then we also need to find out if
there's some equal it takes

144
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:57,680
there's some equal it takes
 

145
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,910
there's some equal it takes
n times right it takes n times to

146
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:01,920
n times right it takes n times to
 

147
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,949
n times right it takes n times to
to find out the sum right

148
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:04,959
to find out the sum right
 

149
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,869
to find out the sum right
of course we can we can have uh we can

150
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:06,879
of course we can we can have uh we can
 

151
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,790
of course we can we can have uh we can
calculate the total sum right

152
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:08,800
calculate the total sum right
 

153
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,509
calculate the total sum right
yeah total sum and then if we find out

154
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:11,519
yeah total sum and then if we find out
 

155
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:12,070
yeah total sum and then if we find out
the sum

156
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:12,080
the sum
 

157
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,229
the sum
of one group we can use the math to

158
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:14,239
of one group we can use the math to
 

159
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,830
of one group we can use the math to
calculate the sum of

160
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:15,840
calculate the sum of
 

161
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,550
calculate the sum of
the other group right does it make sense

162
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:18,560
the other group right does it make sense
 

163
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,830
the other group right does it make sense
by the way these numbers

164
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:19,840
by the way these numbers
 

165
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,270
by the way these numbers
are all you are positive okay it does

166
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:23,280
are all you are positive okay it does
 

167
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,229
are all you are positive okay it does
not contain the

168
00:03:24,229 --> 00:03:24,239
not contain the
 

169
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,149
not contain the
negative numbers doesn't make sense okay

170
00:03:28,149 --> 00:03:28,159
negative numbers doesn't make sense okay
 

171
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,869
negative numbers doesn't make sense okay
uh so this approach is a bit slow yeah

172
00:03:30,869 --> 00:03:30,879
uh so this approach is a bit slow yeah
 

173
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,350
uh so this approach is a bit slow yeah
because the overall term complexities is

174
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:33,360
because the overall term complexities is
 

175
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,789
because the overall term complexities is
this right

176
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:34,799
this right
 

177
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,270
this right
this is exponential yeah it's very very

178
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:37,280
this is exponential yeah it's very very
 

179
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,550
this is exponential yeah it's very very
slow yeah

180
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:38,560
slow yeah
 

181
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,710
slow yeah
yeah i'm right yeah okay so can we

182
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:42,720
yeah i'm right yeah okay so can we
 

183
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,750
yeah i'm right yeah okay so can we
can we do better we

184
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:47,760

 

185
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,830

so i give you a hint how about we sort

186
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:49,840
so i give you a hint how about we sort
 

187
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,949
so i give you a hint how about we sort
the numbers

188
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:50,959
the numbers
 

189
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,110
the numbers
we make it the numbers from the smaller

190
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,120
we make it the numbers from the smaller
 

191
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,229
we make it the numbers from the smaller
to the biggest

192
00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:54,239
to the biggest
 

193
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,509
to the biggest
so in this case 459 495

194
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:57,519
so in this case 459 495
 

195
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,789
so in this case 459 495
we saw the number four five nine

196
00:04:00,789 --> 00:04:00,799
we saw the number four five nine
 

197
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,309
we saw the number four five nine
okay all right you guys like that

198
00:04:04,309 --> 00:04:04,319
okay all right you guys like that
 

199
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,429
okay all right you guys like that
this is not then yes

200
00:04:07,429 --> 00:04:07,439
this is not then yes
 

201
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,350
this is not then yes
while this is working because it's small

202
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:09,360
while this is working because it's small
 

203
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,589
while this is working because it's small
from we saw the number from smallest to

204
00:04:11,589 --> 00:04:11,599
from we saw the number from smallest to
 

205
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,350
from we saw the number from smallest to
biggest

206
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:13,360
biggest
 

207
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,030
biggest
yeah so because the the eventually the

208
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:17,040
yeah so because the the eventually the
 

209
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,509
yeah so because the the eventually the
sum

210
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:17,519
sum
 

211
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,509
sum
has to be divided into two same right

212
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:21,519
has to be divided into two same right
 

213
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,870
has to be divided into two same right
so if i pick if i i continue

214
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:24,880
so if i pick if i i continue
 

215
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,870
so if i pick if i i continue
picking the smallest number smallest

216
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:26,880
picking the smallest number smallest
 

217
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,870
picking the smallest number smallest
number eventually you will be the same

218
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:28,880
number eventually you will be the same
 

219
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,270
number eventually you will be the same
it will be a cases that you'll be the

220
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:33,280
it will be a cases that you'll be the
 

221
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,790
it will be a cases that you'll be the
um you'll be you'll be

222
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:36,800
um you'll be you'll be
 

223
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,990
um you'll be you'll be
either half or more than half right

224
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:40,000
either half or more than half right
 

225
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,350
either half or more than half right
yeah okay so let's

226
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:43,360
yeah okay so let's
 

227
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,870
yeah okay so let's
think about other examples like um

228
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:46,880
think about other examples like um
 

229
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:52,070
think about other examples like um
so look is that four look

230
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,080

 

231
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,070

first of all we need to calculate the

232
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:54,080
first of all we need to calculate the
 

233
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,590
first of all we need to calculate the
sum of all this which is

234
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:55,600
sum of all this which is
 

235
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,550
sum of all this which is
18 right this is can be done using o n

236
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:58,560
18 right this is can be done using o n
 

237
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,430
18 right this is can be done using o n
time right

238
00:04:59,430 --> 00:04:59,440
time right
 

239
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,629
time right
yeah yeah then look then

240
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:02,639
yeah yeah then look then
 

241
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,430
yeah yeah then look then
i have a running sum so four is it times

242
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:05,440
i have a running sum so four is it times
 

243
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,550
i have a running sum so four is it times
two equals

244
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:06,560
two equals
 

245
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,070
two equals
if if it equals half would be nine right

246
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:10,080
if if it equals half would be nine right
 

247
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,629
if if it equals half would be nine right
yeah you say half to nine now i add the

248
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:12,639
yeah you say half to nine now i add the
 

249
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,070
yeah you say half to nine now i add the
five you see how nine yes

250
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:14,080
five you see how nine yes
 

251
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,430
five you see how nine yes
right when it's yes it means that i have

252
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:17,440
right when it's yes it means that i have
 

253
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,870
right when it's yes it means that i have
uh

254
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:18,880
uh
 

255
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,029
uh
i i found a half but i also need to

256
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:21,039
i i found a half but i also need to
 

257
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,189
i i found a half but i also need to
compare like if this number is

258
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:23,199
compare like if this number is
 

259
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,950
compare like if this number is
strictly smaller than the next number

260
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:24,960
strictly smaller than the next number
 

261
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,469
strictly smaller than the next number
right right yeah

262
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:26,479
right right yeah
 

263
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,629
right right yeah
if it's smaller then yes we found the

264
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:28,639
if it's smaller then yes we found the
 

265
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,390
if it's smaller then yes we found the
group if not

266
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:30,400
group if not
 

267
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,950
group if not
it's not let's say if not uh

268
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:34,960
it's not let's say if not uh
 

269
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,790
it's not let's say if not uh
okay so let's do this

270
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:40,800

 

271
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,230

like nine and nine okay so

272
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:44,240
like nine and nine okay so
 

273
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,270
like nine and nine okay so
right look for here nine is half of it

274
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:47,280
right look for here nine is half of it
 

275
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,310
right look for here nine is half of it
take eighteen

276
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:48,320
take eighteen
 

277
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,070
take eighteen
and it's not strictly smaller than the

278
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:50,080
and it's not strictly smaller than the
 

279
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,830
and it's not strictly smaller than the
next one and it's not right

280
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:51,840
next one and it's not right
 

281
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,350
next one and it's not right
yes doesn't make sense

282
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:55,360
yes doesn't make sense
 

283
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,870
yes doesn't make sense
okay so um so how

284
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:58,880
okay so um so how
 

285
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,230
okay so um so how
i mean any other possibilities that this

286
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:02,240
i mean any other possibilities that this
 

287
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,749
i mean any other possibilities that this
echo may not work

288
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:03,759
echo may not work
 

289
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,590
echo may not work
i mean can you think of any example like

290
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:07,600
i mean can you think of any example like
 

291
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,710
i mean can you think of any example like
it may break

292
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:08,720
it may break
 

293
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,670
it may break
foreign

294
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:13,680

 

295
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,950

oh yeah no no i mean is it that will

296
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:16,960
oh yeah no no i mean is it that will
 

297
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,430
oh yeah no no i mean is it that will
still work i mean we just need to return

298
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:19,440
still work i mean we just need to return
 

299
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,870
still work i mean we just need to return
it

300
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:20,880
it
 

301
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,629
it
so for example like uh let's try another

302
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:24,639
so for example like uh let's try another
 

303
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:25,590
so for example like uh let's try another
example okay so

304
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:25,600
example okay so
 

305
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,590
example okay so
you pick one example like 2 4

306
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:29,600
you pick one example like 2 4
 

307
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,629
you pick one example like 2 4
9

308
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:32,639

 

309
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,309

10 okay

310
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:36,319

 

311
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,629

yeah so can you

312
00:06:40,629 --> 00:06:40,639

 

313
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,629

after adding these numbers what's the

314
00:06:42,629 --> 00:06:42,639
after adding these numbers what's the
 

315
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,150
after adding these numbers what's the
sum

316
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:44,160
sum
 

317
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:56,469
sum
25 right you can't do it you can't

318
00:06:56,469 --> 00:06:56,479

 

319
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,390

first time i calculate the sum of all

320
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:58,400
first time i calculate the sum of all
 

321
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,390
first time i calculate the sum of all
numbers which is 25

322
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:00,400
numbers which is 25
 

323
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,029
numbers which is 25
so i know it's impossible yeah why is

324
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:03,039
so i know it's impossible yeah why is
 

325
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,950
so i know it's impossible yeah why is
that because 25 cannot be divided into

326
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:04,960
that because 25 cannot be divided into
 

327
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,909
that because 25 cannot be divided into
two

328
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:05,919
two
 

329
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,909
two
okay that's what it says yeah okay so

330
00:07:07,909 --> 00:07:07,919
okay that's what it says yeah okay so
 

331
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:08,950
okay that's what it says yeah okay so
now if i put

332
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:08,960
now if i put
 

333
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,589
now if i put
11 here okay so now

334
00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:13,599
11 here okay so now
 

335
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,670
11 here okay so now
that will be 26 yeah 36 and then i'm

336
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:17,680
that will be 26 yeah 36 and then i'm
 

337
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,830
that will be 26 yeah 36 and then i'm
looking for 13 right

338
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:19,840
looking for 13 right
 

339
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:25,270
looking for 13 right
13. yeah

340
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:25,280

 

341
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,950

number n2 okay wait wait wait

342
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:30,960
number n2 okay wait wait wait
 

343
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,150
number n2 okay wait wait wait
no so that's what uh

344
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:34,160
no so that's what uh
 

345
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,749
no so that's what uh
six plus four 26 26 is 13 right

346
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:37,759
six plus four 26 26 is 13 right
 

347
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,350
six plus four 26 26 is 13 right
13. so

348
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:41,360

 

349
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,990

okay so so that agreement woke or not

350
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:44,000
okay so so that agreement woke or not
 

351
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,469
okay so so that agreement woke or not
look two plus four

352
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:46,479
look two plus four
 

353
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,309
look two plus four
two two plus four six six plus

354
00:07:50,309 --> 00:07:50,319
two two plus four six six plus
 

355
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:55,670
two two plus four six six plus
nine fifteen fifteen

356
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:55,680
nine fifteen fifteen
 

357
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,189
nine fifteen fifteen
fifteen so i can't see

358
00:07:59,189 --> 00:07:59,199
fifteen so i can't see
 

359
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,749
fifteen so i can't see
so it's not but why you saying this is

360
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:01,759
so it's not but why you saying this is
 

361
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:02,710
so it's not but why you saying this is
okay because look

362
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:02,720
okay because look
 

363
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:09,589
okay because look
two and eleven four and nine

364
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:09,599

 

365
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,469

this group and this group the numbers

366
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:12,479
this group and this group the numbers
 

367
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:12,869
this group and this group the numbers
here

368
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:12,879
here
 

369
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,510
here
are not strictly smaller than this one

370
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:15,520
are not strictly smaller than this one
 

371
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,029
are not strictly smaller than this one
because 11 is bigger than that

372
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:17,039
because 11 is bigger than that
 

373
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,150
because 11 is bigger than that
right doesn't make sense that's why

374
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:20,160
right doesn't make sense that's why
 

375
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,909
right doesn't make sense that's why
that's why we need to solve the numbers

376
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:21,919
that's why we need to solve the numbers
 

377
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,909
that's why we need to solve the numbers
because we want to make sure the numbers

378
00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:23,919
because we want to make sure the numbers
 

379
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,110
because we want to make sure the numbers
in one group

380
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:25,120
in one group
 

381
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,029
in one group
as 60 smaller than the other group does

382
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:27,039
as 60 smaller than the other group does
 

383
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,110
as 60 smaller than the other group does
it make sense that's why we started

384
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:29,120
it make sense that's why we started
 

385
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,430
it make sense that's why we started
even though you can find two plus eleven

386
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:31,440
even though you can find two plus eleven
 

387
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,790
even though you can find two plus eleven
equals four five but

388
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:32,800
equals four five but
 

389
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,029
equals four five but
still it's not possible to split into

390
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:35,039
still it's not possible to split into
 

391
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,230
still it's not possible to split into
according to the third

392
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:36,240
according to the third
 

393
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,990
according to the third
requirement which is the numbers in one

394
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:38,000
requirement which is the numbers in one
 

395
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,350
requirement which is the numbers in one
group are strictly smaller than the

396
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:39,360
group are strictly smaller than the
 

397
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,070
group are strictly smaller than the
other one

398
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:40,080
other one
 

399
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,709
other one
so this may not work all right so so the

400
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:42,719
so this may not work all right so so the
 

401
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:43,990
so this may not work all right so so the
excellent we pick is

402
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:44,000
excellent we pick is
 

403
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,870
excellent we pick is
right here because look two four which

404
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:46,880
right here because look two four which
 

405
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,430
right here because look two four which
is six

406
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:47,440
is six
 

407
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,710
is six
six plus nine fifteen is bigger than 13

408
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:50,720
six plus nine fifteen is bigger than 13
 

409
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,389
six plus nine fifteen is bigger than 13
then we know it's not possible to find

410
00:08:52,389 --> 00:08:52,399
then we know it's not possible to find
 

411
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,230
then we know it's not possible to find
such thing yeah that's why we need to

412
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:54,240
such thing yeah that's why we need to
 

413
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:54,790
such thing yeah that's why we need to
start it

414
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:54,800
start it
 

415
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,150
start it
does it make sense yeah okay any

416
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:58,160
does it make sense yeah okay any
 

417
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:58,870
does it make sense yeah okay any
questions

418
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:58,880
questions
 

419
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,750
questions
no no okay let's do this

420
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:03,760

 

421
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:14,230

define set split

422
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:14,240

 

423
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,350

okay now look let's say sum

424
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:17,360
okay now look let's say sum
 

425
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,230
okay now look let's say sum
equals sum we how can we find the sum of

426
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:20,240
equals sum we how can we find the sum of
 

427
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,310
equals sum we how can we find the sum of
the all the numbers in in

428
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:22,320
the all the numbers in in
 

429
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,470
the all the numbers in in
in numbers can you write a for loop

430
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:26,480
in numbers can you write a for loop
 

431
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,470
in numbers can you write a for loop
like look s equals zero and then one for

432
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:30,480
like look s equals zero and then one for
 

433
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,790
like look s equals zero and then one for
i in num right look

434
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:34,800
i in num right look
 

435
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,389
i in num right look
what should happen here if i want to add

436
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:36,399
what should happen here if i want to add
 

437
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,870
what should happen here if i want to add
all numbers of i

438
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:38,880
all numbers of i
 

439
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,910
all numbers of i
but all the numbers in the numbers

440
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:41,920
but all the numbers in the numbers
 

441
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,430
but all the numbers in the numbers
yeah i want to sum all the numbers in

442
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:43,440
yeah i want to sum all the numbers in
 

443

465
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:12,710
one add pie come on this is simple yeah
but

466
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:12,720
but
 

467
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,110
but
i know that yeah but you don't need to

468
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:15,120
i know that yeah but you don't need to
 

469
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,949
i know that yeah but you don't need to
write this right because this is getting

470
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:16,959
write this right because this is getting
 

471
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,230
write this right because this is getting
all the numbers sum to

472
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:18,240
all the numbers sum to
 

473
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,430
all the numbers sum to
s we can just do this function sum

474
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:21,440
s we can just do this function sum
 

475
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,470
s we can just do this function sum
yeah yeah that's it the same thing

476
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:24,480
yeah yeah that's it the same thing
 

477
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,990
yeah yeah that's it the same thing
you see the same thing huh okay now

478
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:28,000
you see the same thing huh okay now
 

479
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:43,030
you see the same thing huh okay now
if s is odd number how can we write it

480
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:43,040

 

481
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,150

if it's one one and i know it's not

482
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:46,160
if it's one one and i know it's not
 

483
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,590
if it's one one and i know it's not
possible yeah we can first

484
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:49,600

 

485
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,389

okay model two can also be like written

486
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:52,399
okay model two can also be like written
 

487
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:52,790
okay model two can also be like written
as

488
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:52,800
as
 

489
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,110
as
s and one yeah it's the same thing yeah

490
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:55,120
s and one yeah it's the same thing yeah
 

491
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,790
s and one yeah it's the same thing yeah
remember this bit

492
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:56,800
remember this bit
 

493
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,509
remember this bit
binary yeah if you end one if the last

494
00:10:59,509 --> 00:10:59,519
binary yeah if you end one if the last
 

495
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,470
binary yeah if you end one if the last
bit is one is

496
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:00,480
bit is one is
 

497
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,630
bit is one is
e autumn if it's zero is even number

498
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:02,640
e autumn if it's zero is even number
 

499
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,509
e autumn if it's zero is even number
yeah

500
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:03,519

501
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,150
yeah
so this and this are equivalent the same

502
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:06,160
so this and this are equivalent the same

okay then look c i need to
 

519
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,069
okay then look c i need to
end equals i right yes

520
00:11:32,069 --> 00:11:32,079

529
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,590

right because if 82 equals sum it means

530
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:57,600
right because if 82 equals sum it means
 

531
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,590
right because if 82 equals sum it means
we find the half right

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,189
look 100 log two base
two equals one equals one right log two

590
00:13:53,189 --> 00:13:53,199
two equals one equals one right log two
 

591
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:53,829
two equals one equals one right log two

00:13:53,829 --> 00:13:53,839
base two
 

593
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,430
base two
equals one that's four you have two four

594
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:57,440
equals one that's four you have two four
 

595
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,470
equals one that's four you have two four
equals one

596
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:02,480
equals one
 

597
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,870
equals one
two times what two to the power of one

598
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:04,880
two times what two to the power of one
 

599
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,310
two times what two to the power of one
equals four

00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:08,320

 

601
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,550

two two yes okay log two

602
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:12,560
two two yes okay log two
 

603
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,189
two two yes okay log two
sixteen equals one two to the power of 4

604
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:15,199
sixteen equals one two to the power of 4
 

605
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,150
sixteen equals one two to the power of 4
equals 16.

606
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:16,160
equals 16.
 

607
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,829
equals 16.
uh 8. 2 to the power

608
00:14:19,829 --> 00:14:19,839
uh 8. 2 to the power
 

609
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,310
uh 8. 2 to the power
4 yes come on so you do you get it so

610
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:22,320
4 yes come on so you do you get it so
 

611
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,430
4 yes come on so you do you get it so
this n

612
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:23,440
this n
 

613
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,910
this n
this will be bigger than zero because

614
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:25,920
this will be bigger than zero because
 

615
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,829
this will be bigger than zero because
log n is like that

616
00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:27,839
log n is like that
 

617
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:42,069
log n is like that
is this yeah

618
00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:42,079

 

619
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,990

why is n and this is n

620
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:46,000
why is n and this is n
 

621
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,430
why is n and this is n
so when n n is one it will be zero when

622
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:49,440
so when n n is one it will be zero when
 

623
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:49,829
so when n n is one it will be zero when
n

624
00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:49,839
n
 

625
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,389
n
is two there will be one so you'll be

626
00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:52,399
is two there will be one so you'll be
 

627
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,189
is two there will be one so you'll be
like that right

628
00:14:53,189 --> 00:14:53,199
like that right
 

629
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,150
like that right
doesn't make sense yeah so this is

630
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:56,160
doesn't make sense yeah so this is
 

631
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,590
doesn't make sense yeah so this is
negative you don't need to worry about

632
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:57,600
negative you don't need to worry about
 

633
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,230
negative you don't need to worry about
that

634
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:58,240
that
 

635
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,150
that
so n look log n this is 1 this is 1

636
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:02,160
so n look log n this is 1 this is 1
 

637
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,910
so n look log n this is 1 this is 1
because log 2 1 is 0 yeah because 2 to

638
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:05,920
because log 2 1 is 0 yeah because 2 to
 

639
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,910
because log 2 1 is 0 yeah because 2 to
the power of 0 is 1 right

640
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:07,920
the power of 0 is 1 right
 

641
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,990
the power of 0 is 1 right
look yeah 2 2 to the power 1 is 0

642
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:12,000
look yeah 2 2 to the power 1 is 0
 

643
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,470
look yeah 2 2 to the power 1 is 0
so n when when n

644
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:16,480
so n when when n
 

645
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,590
so n when when n
when n is 1

646
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:19,600
when n is 1
 

647
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,629
when n is 1
x coordinate is 1 then y will be 0 right

648
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:22,639
x coordinate is 1 then y will be 0 right
 

649
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:23,350
x coordinate is 1 then y will be 0 right
this is y

650
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:23,360
this is y
 

651
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,790
this is y
right does it make sense yes look

652
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:26,800
right does it make sense yes look
 

653
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,230
right does it make sense yes look
another thing okay

let's try if it's all right okay look

666
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:52,560
let's try if it's all right okay look

00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,509
log two let's say uh
two times two times

670
00:15:59,509 --> 00:15:59,519
two times two times
 

671
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,870
two times two times
uh maybe

672
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:02,880
uh maybe
 

673
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,189
uh maybe
maybe four okay let's see if it's what

674
00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:05,199
maybe four okay let's see if it's what
 

675
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,030
maybe four okay let's see if it's what
log2

676
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:07,040
log2
 

677
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,670
log2
hey this is three yeah all right all

678
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:09,680
hey this is three yeah all right all
 

679
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,150
hey this is three yeah all right all
right

680
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:10,160
right
 

681
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,670
right
two to the power of three equals eight

682
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:11,680
two to the power of three equals eight
 

683
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,509
two to the power of three equals eight
right at least if

684
00:16:13,509 --> 00:16:13,519
right at least if
 

685
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,550
right at least if
if this will be log two two

686
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:16,560
if this will be log two two
 

687
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,670
if this will be log two two
plus log two four right two to the power

688
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:19,680
plus log two four right two to the power
 

689
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,629
plus log two four right two to the power
of two is

690
00:16:20,629 --> 00:16:20,639
of two is
 

691
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,310
of two is
two to the power 1 is this is 1 right

692
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:24,320
two to the power 1 is this is 1 right
 

693
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,629
two to the power 1 is this is 1 right
this is 2 right 1 plus 2 equals 3 okay

694
00:16:26,629 --> 00:16:26,639
this is 2 right 1 plus 2 equals 3 okay
 

695
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:27,910
this is 2 right 1 plus 2 equals 3 okay
does it make sense

696
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:27,920
does it make sense
 

697
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,150
does it make sense
log 2 ap so basically is log

698
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:32,160
log 2 ap so basically is log
 

699
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,430
log 2 ap so basically is log
x a b equals log

700
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:35,440
x a b equals log
 

701
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,870
x a b equals log
x a plus log x b and another formula

702
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:38,880
x a plus log x b and another formula
 

703
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,269
x a plus log x b and another formula
yeah

704
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:39,279
yeah
 

705
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,749
yeah
look only times you you can plus right

706
00:16:41,749 --> 00:16:41,759
look only times you you can plus right
 

707
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:42,949
look only times you you can plus right
so when you divide

708
00:16:42,949 --> 00:16:42,959
so when you divide
 

709
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,550
so when you divide
like when a divides b right

710
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:46,560
like when a divides b right
 

711
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,150
like when a divides b right
and then this will be minus right

712
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:48,160
and then this will be minus right
 

713
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,069
and then this will be minus right
because a times b

714
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:50,079
because a times b
 

715
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,189
because a times b
equals 80 divide look

716
00:16:53,189 --> 00:16:53,199
equals 80 divide look
 

717
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,629
equals 80 divide look
a times b actually is the same as a

718
00:16:56,629 --> 00:16:56,639
a times b actually is the same as a
 

719
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,870
a times b actually is the same as a
divided by

720
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:00,880

 

721
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,829

right a quarter over b yeah i'm right

722
00:17:03,829 --> 00:17:03,839
right a quarter over b yeah i'm right
 

723
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,189
right a quarter over b yeah i'm right
does it make sense it's the same thing

724
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:05,199
does it make sense it's the same thing
 

725
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:05,750
does it make sense it's the same thing
yeah

726
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:05,760
yeah
 

727
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,429
yeah
it's the same thing this is the same as

728
00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:07,439
it's the same thing this is the same as
 

729
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,110
it's the same thing this is the same as
this right

730
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:09,120
this right
 

731
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,870
this right
all right look 2 times 3 equals

732
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:12,880
all right look 2 times 3 equals
 

733
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:19,590
all right look 2 times 3 equals
2 times 2 divided by

734
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:19,600
2 times 2 divided by
 

735
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,110
2 times 2 divided by
1 over 3 yeah 2 times 3 equals 6

736
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:23,120
1 over 3 yeah 2 times 3 equals 6
 

737
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,789
1 over 3 yeah 2 times 3 equals 6
equals is the same as 2 how 2 divided by

738
00:17:26,789 --> 00:17:26,799
equals is the same as 2 how 2 divided by
 

739
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:27,909
equals is the same as 2 how 2 divided by
a

740
00:17:27,909 --> 00:17:27,919
a
 

741
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,549
a
3. yeah i'm right it makes sense okay

742
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:30,559
3. yeah i'm right it makes sense okay
 

743
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:31,270
3. yeah i'm right it makes sense okay
another thing

744
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:31,280
another thing
 

745
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,350
another thing
and nothing okay a little bit more okay

746
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:35,360

 

747
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,710

log 2 2 to the power of 3 here

748
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:40,720
log 2 2 to the power of 3 here
 

749
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,430
log 2 2 to the power of 3 here
equals 1. hey

750
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:45,440
equals 1. hey
 

751
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,669
equals 1. hey
just equals you can put these in the

752
00:17:47,669 --> 00:17:47,679
just equals you can put these in the
 

753
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,350
just equals you can put these in the
front that would be three times

754
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:49,360
front that would be three times
 

755
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,830
front that would be three times
log two two that would be three yeah

756
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:51,840
log two two that would be three yeah
 

757
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,390
log two two that would be three yeah
let's try

758
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:52,400
let's try
 

759
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,549
let's try
log two to the power of four to the

760
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:54,559
log two to the power of four to the
 

761
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,789
log two to the power of four to the
power of two

762
00:17:56,789 --> 00:17:56,799
power of two
 

763
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,070
power of two
okay so you can please here four

764
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:00,080
okay so you can please here four
 

765
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,830
okay so you can please here four
and that would be two so that would be

766
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:01,840
and that would be two so that would be
 

767
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,990
and that would be two so that would be
four yes does it make sense

768
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:04,000
four yes does it make sense
 

769
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,110
four yes does it make sense
because log two to the power of 16

770
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:07,120
because log two to the power of 16
 

771
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,390
because log two to the power of 16
is four yeah it's the same thing yeah

772
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:08,400
is four yeah it's the same thing yeah
 

773
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,630
is four yeah it's the same thing yeah
does it make sense yes okay so

774
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:10,640
does it make sense yes okay so
 

775
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,310
does it make sense yes okay so
so okay so a little bit far away okay so

776
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:14,320
so okay so a little bit far away okay so
 

777
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:14,950
so okay so a little bit far away okay so
this is

778
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:14,960
this is
 

779
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,230
this is
o log a o log n right o n log n this is

780
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:18,240
o log a o log n right o n log n this is
 

781
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:18,549
o log a o log n right o n log n this is
o

782
00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:18,559
o
 

783
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,830
o
n so this is this is this is bigger so

784
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:21,840
n so this is this is this is bigger so
 

785
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,190
n so this is this is this is bigger so
we pick this one

786
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:23,200
we pick this one
 

787
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,190
we pick this one
this one is the most dominating most

788
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:25,200
this one is the most dominating most
 

789
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,029
this one is the most dominating most
time consuming part of the aggregate

790
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:27,039
time consuming part of the aggregate
 

791
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:27,590
time consuming part of the aggregate
right

792
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:27,600
right
 

793
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,830
right
but this one is triggered compared to

794
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:29,840
but this one is triggered compared to
 

795
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,990
but this one is triggered compared to
this one so the overall time context is

796
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:32,000
this one so the overall time context is
 

797
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,710
this one so the overall time context is
o

00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:31,039
you can also see plus c equals s right
 

835
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,590
you can also see plus c equals s right
it's the same thing yeah or c equal

836
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:33,600
it's the same thing yeah or c equal
 

837
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,230
it's the same thing yeah or c equal
equal s

838
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:34,240
equal s
 

839
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,390
equal s
divided by two yeah it's the same thing

840
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:36,400
divided by two yeah it's the same thing
 

841
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,669
divided by two yeah it's the same thing
yeah yeah

842
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:37,679
yeah yeah
 

843
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,390
yeah yeah
the thing is that we want to check if c

844
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:40,400
the thing is that we want to check if c
 

845
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:40,710
the thing is that we want to check if c
is

846
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:40,720
is
 

847
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,470
is
half of s if it is half of s

848
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:44,480
half of s if it is half of s
 

849
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,350
half of s if it is half of s
it means that we find half of it right

850
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:47,360
it means that we find half of it right
 

851
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,029
it means that we find half of it right
and we also need to check if the current

852
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:49,039
and we also need to check if the current
 

853
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,950
and we also need to check if the current
number is next is strictly smaller than

854
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:50,960
number is next is strictly smaller than
 

855
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,150
number is next is strictly smaller than
the next number

856
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:52,160
the next number
 

857
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,230
the next number
if it is that it means we find the two

858
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:54,240
if it is that it means we find the two
 

859
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,350
if it is that it means we find the two
groups which

860
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:55,360
groups which
 

861
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,990
groups which
one group is a strictly smaller another

862
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:58,000
one group is a strictly smaller another
 

863
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,430
one group is a strictly smaller another
group that will determine true

864
00:19:59,430 --> 00:19:59,440
group that will determine true
 

865
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,909
group that will determine true
yeah in all other cases we return first

866
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:01,919
yeah in all other cases we return first
 

867
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,789
yeah in all other cases we return first
and can we actually remove this

868
00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:04,799
and can we actually remove this
 

869
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,350
and can we actually remove this
what if anymore this bit does this

870
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:07,360
what if anymore this bit does this
 

871
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,430
what if anymore this bit does this
accuracy still work

872
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:09,440
accuracy still work
 

873
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,470
accuracy still work
maybe it does maybe yes or no come on

874
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:12,480
maybe it does maybe yes or no come on
 

875
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,990
maybe it does maybe yes or no come on
yes or no

876
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:14,000
yes or no
 

877
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,870
yes or no
maybe or maybe not what are we checking

878
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:16,880
maybe or maybe not what are we checking
 

879
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,110
maybe or maybe not what are we checking
here we want to do ten fourths right

880
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:19,120
here we want to do ten fourths right
 

881
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,789
here we want to do ten fourths right
if we're not returning force it will be

882
00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:20,799
if we're not returning force it will be
 

883
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,310
if we're not returning force it will be
returning false here right

884
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:22,320
returning false here right
 

885
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,710
returning false here right
so it will still work but why are we

886
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:24,720
so it will still work but why are we
 

887
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,190
so it will still work but why are we
adding this

888
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:27,200
adding this
 

889
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,390
adding this
to make it faster right because as long

890
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:30,400
to make it faster right because as long
 

891
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,310
to make it faster right because as long
as we find

892
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:32,320
as we find
 

893
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,350
as we find
we can't find such half we can just

894
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:35,360
we can't find such half we can just
 

895
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,750
we can't find such half we can just
return first right because it's no point

896
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:37,760
return first right because it's no point
 

897
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,909
return first right because it's no point
to continue searching the heart another

898
00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:39,919
to continue searching the heart another
 

899
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,909
to continue searching the heart another
half of the array am i right

900
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:41,919
half of the array am i right
 

901
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,230
half of the array am i right
does it make sense yeah are you sure

902
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:44,240
does it make sense yeah are you sure
 

903
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,110
does it make sense yeah are you sure
yeah

904
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:45,120
yeah
 

905
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,149
yeah
okay tell me why we need to at least

906
00:20:48,149 --> 00:20:48,159
okay tell me why we need to at least
 

907
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,830
okay tell me why we need to at least
okay so it is a 9.2

908
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:51,840
okay so it is a 9.2
 

909
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,310
okay so it is a 9.2
uh check the other half of it why why is

910
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:54,320
uh check the other half of it why why is
 

911
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,430
uh check the other half of it why why is
that when when

912
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:55,440
that when when
 

913
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,669
that when when
when is that true uh when

914
00:20:59,669 --> 00:20:59,679
when is that true uh when
 

915
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,909
when is that true uh when
okay so uh understand what why

916
00:21:03,909 --> 00:21:03,919
okay so uh understand what why
 

917
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,029
okay so uh understand what why
when c what when c is

918
00:21:07,029 --> 00:21:07,039
when c what when c is
 

919
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:10,149
when c what when c is
and two c makes

920
00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:10,159
and two c makes
 

921
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,029
and two c makes
f yeah when c is more than half it means

922
00:21:13,029 --> 00:21:13,039
f yeah when c is more than half it means
 

923
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,549
f yeah when c is more than half it means
we don't need to continue right because

924
00:21:14,549 --> 00:21:14,559
we don't need to continue right because
 

925
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:15,990
we don't need to continue right because
they are all positive numbers

926
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:16,000
they are all positive numbers
 

927
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,470
they are all positive numbers
that if we continue we will be more than

928
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:18,480
that if we continue we will be more than
 

929
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,270
that if we continue we will be more than
half right

930
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:19,280
half right
 

931
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,830
half right
so there's no point to continue so we we

932
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:21,840
so there's no point to continue so we we
 

933
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,630
so there's no point to continue so we we
are returning

934
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:22,640
are returning
 

935
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,669
are returning
early return and early access so that

936
00:21:25,669 --> 00:21:25,679
early return and early access so that
 

937
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,110
early return and early access so that
makes it faster right

938
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:27,120
makes it faster right
 

939
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,430
makes it faster right
does it make sense okay okay let's see

940
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:29,440
does it make sense okay okay let's see
 

941
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,390
does it make sense okay okay let's see
okay that's it

942
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:30,400
okay that's it
 

943
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:36,159
okay that's it
thank you thank you very much as i say
