uh
 

23
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,830
uh
parentheses yeah yeah these are premises

24
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:28,840
parentheses yeah yeah these are premises
 

25
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,470
parentheses yeah yeah these are premises
yeah

26
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:32,480

 

27
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,110

bracket exactly so this pregnancy so if

i give you a
 

31
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,670
i give you a
string contains only these parentheses

32
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:39,680
string contains only these parentheses
 

33
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,150
string contains only these parentheses
yeah so for example uh if i leave

34
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:44,160
yeah so for example uh if i leave

47
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,830

and you need an even number of those

48
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:07,840
and you need an even number of those
 

49
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,510
and you need an even number of those
this is good but but this is not good

50

okay even this is not closing

64
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:34,720

69
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,270

so you say this is not closing how about

70
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:47,280
so you say this is not closing how about
 

71
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:47,910
so you say this is not closing how about
this one

72
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:47,920
this one
 

73
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,350
this one
uh how about that

75
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,670

and that is still not valid so

76
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:55,680
and that is still not valid so
 

77

84
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:06,840
they have to be the same number
 

85
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,589
they have to be the same number
of things that we're doing that yeah

86
00:02:09,589 --> 00:02:09,599
of things that we're doing that yeah

we need to find if each every
starting parenthesis should be closed

98
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:23,440
starting parenthesis should be closed
 

99
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,270
starting parenthesis should be closed
with parentheses yes

100
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:25,280
with parentheses yes
 

101
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,309

you you can't start apprentices without

104
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:30,640
you you can't start apprentices without
 

105
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,509
you you can't start apprentices without
the bracket

106
00:02:31,509 --> 00:02:31,519
the bracket
 

107
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,550
the bracket
the starting you can't have uh these

108
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:34,560
the starting you can't have uh these
 

109
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,110
the starting you can't have uh these
without these three together it needs to

110
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:37,120
without these three together it needs to
 

111
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,229
without these three together it needs to
match

112
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:38,239
match
 

113
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,350
match
yeah yeah and as you said there's there

114
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:41,360
yeah yeah and as you said there's there
 

115
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:41,990
yeah yeah and as you said there's there
should be

116
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:42,000
should be
 

117
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,070
should be
even number right because we are they

118
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:44,080
even number right because we are they
 

119
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,110
even number right because we are they
all

120
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:45,120
all
 

121
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,630
all
come with a pair okay so given uh

122
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:48,640
come with a pair okay so given uh
 

123
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,430
come with a pair okay so given uh
a string let's see how can we do this

124
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:51,440
a string let's see how can we do this
 

125
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,869
a string let's see how can we do this
okay let's define it

126
00:02:52,869 --> 00:02:52,879
okay let's define it
 

127
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,070
okay let's define it
define f yeah we call it we can call it

128
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:56,080
define f yeah we call it we can call it
 

129
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,990
define f yeah we call it we can call it
valid parentheses but we also can

130
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,000
valid parentheses but we also can
 

131
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,030
valid parentheses but we also can
have this f just for sure then bracket

132
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:01,040
have this f just for sure then bracket
 

133
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:08,550
have this f just for sure then bracket
s bracket

134
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:08,560

 

135
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,390

don't look at my nose yeah okay so

136
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:10,400
don't look at my nose yeah okay so
 

137
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,910
don't look at my nose yeah okay so
listen to me okay

138
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:11,920
listen to me okay
 

139
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,509
listen to me okay
so how what's the what's the

140
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:15,519
so how what's the what's the
 

141
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,830
so how what's the what's the
what's the uh how do you solve this

142
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:17,840
what's the uh how do you solve this
 

143
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,550
what's the uh how do you solve this
problem i

144
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:18,560
problem i
 

145
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:25,350
problem i
like this how do you solve it

146
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:25,360

 

147
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,550

first it needs to start with a opening

148
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:28,560
first it needs to start with a opening
 

149
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,509
first it needs to start with a opening
bracket yeah okay so so can we we can

150
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:31,519
bracket yeah okay so so can we we can
 

151
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,030
bracket yeah okay so so can we we can
have a

152
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,040
have a
 

153
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,190
have a
count like balance yeah we have we can

154
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:35,200
count like balance yeah we have we can
 

155
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,149
count like balance yeah we have we can
have a balance

156
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:36,159
have a balance
 

157
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,750
have a balance
count if we meet the starting yeah

158
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:39,760
count if we meet the starting yeah
 

159
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,270
count if we meet the starting yeah
yes we increment this

160
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:43,280
yes we increment this
 

161
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,390
yes we increment this
we increment this okay

162
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:46,400
we increment this okay
 

163
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,910
we increment this okay
yeah if we mean this closing bracket

164
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:49,920
yeah if we mean this closing bracket
 

165
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,030
yeah if we mean this closing bracket
we decrement it right

166
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,040
we decrement it right
 

167
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,470
we decrement it right
all right yes

168
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:56,480
all right yes
 

169
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,110
all right yes
okay so we need to check at the end if

170
00:03:59,110 --> 00:03:59,120
okay so we need to check at the end if
 

171
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,309
okay so we need to check at the end if
it's equal to zero

172
00:04:00,309 --> 00:04:00,319
it's equal to zero
 

173
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,190
it's equal to zero
right if it's zero it comes with pair

174
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:03,200
right if it's zero it comes with pair
 

175
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,149
right if it's zero it comes with pair
but however

176
00:04:04,149 --> 00:04:04,159
but however
 

177
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,589
but however
if if we decrement one and we find that

178
00:04:07,589 --> 00:04:07,599
if if we decrement one and we find that
 

179
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,589
if if we decrement one and we find that
it's become negative number then it's

180
00:04:09,589 --> 00:04:09,599
it's become negative number then it's
 

181
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,429
it's become negative number then it's
not valid i'm right

182
00:04:11,429 --> 00:04:11,439
not valid i'm right
 

183
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,470
not valid i'm right
for example like look at this one now

184
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:14,480
for example like look at this one now
 

185
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,830
for example like look at this one now
one zero okay let's read it

186
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:17,840
one zero okay let's read it
 

187
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,749
one zero okay let's read it
yeah one zero

188
00:04:21,749 --> 00:04:21,759
yeah one zero
 

189
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,830
yeah one zero
one zero read it one

190
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:25,840
one zero read it one
 

191
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,749
one zero read it one
zero minus one not below zero

192
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:29,759
zero minus one not below zero
 

193
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,790
zero minus one not below zero
it's invalid right you'll get it

194
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:32,800
it's invalid right you'll get it
 

195
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,710
it's invalid right you'll get it
how do you know the numbers i don't get

196
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:34,720
how do you know the numbers i don't get
 

197
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,830
how do you know the numbers i don't get
it this is

198
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:35,840
it this is
 

199
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,870
it this is
b we have a counter balance when we need

200
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:38,880
b we have a counter balance when we need
 

201
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,350
b we have a counter balance when we need
a

202
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:39,360
a
 

203
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,230
a
starting bracket we increment one we

204
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:42,240
starting bracket we increment one we
 

205
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,189
starting bracket we increment one we
make it one in

206
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:43,199
make it one in
 

207
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,469
make it one in
plus one yeah so b is not one we

208
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:46,479
plus one yeah so b is not one we
 

209
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,670
plus one yeah so b is not one we
mean this closing bracket we minus one

210
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:49,680
mean this closing bracket we minus one
 

211
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,710
mean this closing bracket we minus one
so one becomes minus one is zero right

212
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:52,720
so one becomes minus one is zero right
 

213
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,469
so one becomes minus one is zero right
when we finish this we check with b zero

214
00:04:56,469 --> 00:04:56,479
when we finish this we check with b zero
 

215
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,390
when we finish this we check with b zero
yeah this is the same one zero

216
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:00,400
yeah this is the same one zero
 

217
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,830
yeah this is the same one zero
one zero so that's good one

218
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:03,840
one zero so that's good one
 

219
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,909
one zero so that's good one
zero but now we're meeting another

220
00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:05,919
zero but now we're meeting another
 

221
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,790
zero but now we're meeting another
closing we need to minus one again

222
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:08,800
closing we need to minus one again
 

223
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,270
closing we need to minus one again
that becomes negative one so which means

224
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:11,280
that becomes negative one so which means
 

225
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,029
that becomes negative one so which means
it's invalid

226
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:13,039
it's invalid
 

227
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:17,510
it's invalid
yeah how about this one

228
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:17,520

 

229
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,710

minus one invalid yeah

230
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:20,720
minus one invalid yeah
 

231
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,469
minus one invalid yeah
how about this one

232
00:05:24,469 --> 00:05:24,479
how about this one
 

233
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,310
how about this one
zero one at the end is not equal to zero

234
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:28,320
zero one at the end is not equal to zero
 

235
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,990
zero one at the end is not equal to zero
so it's inverted

236
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:30,000
so it's inverted
 

237
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,830
so it's inverted
yeah simple yeah is it simple

238
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:33,840
yeah simple yeah is it simple
 

239
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,830
yeah simple yeah is it simple
still get it okay so we can write this

240
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:36,840
still get it okay so we can write this
 

241
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,310
still get it okay so we can write this
easier

242
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:38,320
easier
 

243
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,550
easier

244
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:42,560
b yeah that's the very one
 

245
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,189
b yeah that's the very one
but you don't need a dot in the middle

253
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,510

yeah look if i

254
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:57,520
yeah look if i
 

255
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,670
yeah look if i
equals starting bracket yeah

256
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:01,680
equals starting bracket yeah
 

257
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,230
equals starting bracket yeah
if i go starting breaking everything

258
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:04,240
if i go starting breaking everything
 

259
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,550
if i go starting breaking everything
what do i do

260
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:06,560
what do i do
 

261
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,990
what do i do
p plus equals 1 right

262
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:10,000
p plus equals 1 right

s as
if x is or we can check f if

266
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:17,600
if x is or we can check f if
 

267
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,870
if x is or we can check f if
i equals

00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:24,240
ending bracket b minus equal one
 

271
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,070
ending bracket b minus equal one
but we need to check if we fall below

272
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:26,080
but we need to check if we fall below
 

273
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,309
but we need to check if we fall below
zero at this time right

274
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:28,319
zero at this time right
 

275
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:34,290
zero at this time right
so if b is smaller than zero

276
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:34,300
so if b is smaller than zero
 

277
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:39,640
so if b is smaller than zero
