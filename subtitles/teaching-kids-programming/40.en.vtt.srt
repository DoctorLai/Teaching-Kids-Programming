okay
 

23
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,269
okay
so remember yesterday we talked about

24
00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:25,279
so remember yesterday we talked about
 

25
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,029
so remember yesterday we talked about
the link list

26
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:27,039
the link list
 

27
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,109
the link list
the link

28
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:31,119
the link
 

29
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,069
the link
so remember the chain yeah we have a

30
00:00:34,069 --> 00:00:34,079
so remember the chain yeah we have a
 

31
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:34,630
so remember the chain yeah we have a
note

32
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:34,640
note
 

33
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,709
note
then we have a value one for possibly i

34
00:00:36,709 --> 00:00:36,719
then we have a value one for possibly i
 

35
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,709
then we have a value one for possibly i
will point it to the next one

36
00:00:38,709 --> 00:00:38,719
will point it to the next one
 

37
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,830
will point it to the next one
yeah and the points to next one

38
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:41,840
yeah and the points to next one
 

39
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,069
yeah and the points to next one
okay and then it's etcetera etcetera

40
00:00:44,069 --> 00:00:44,079
okay and then it's etcetera etcetera
 

41
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,630
okay and then it's etcetera etcetera
okay so suppose there are lots of them

42
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:46,640
okay so suppose there are lots of them
 

43
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,069
okay so suppose there are lots of them
you just see yeah yeah so if you are

44
00:00:50,069 --> 00:00:50,079
you just see yeah yeah so if you are
 

45
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:50,790
you just see yeah yeah so if you are
given

46
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:50,800
given
 

47
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,830
given
so today if you're given uh the head

48
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:53,840
so today if you're given uh the head
 

49
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,990
so today if you're given uh the head
normally you say the head of the link

50
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:56,000
normally you say the head of the link
 

51
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,830
normally you say the head of the link
list

52
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:57,840
list
 

53
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,029
list
think i just keep thinking you said cat

54
00:01:01,029 --> 00:01:01,039
think i just keep thinking you said cat
 

55
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,950
think i just keep thinking you said cat
head and then look at the last last note

56
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:04,960
head and then look at the last last note
 

57
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,510
head and then look at the last last note
does not have a next pointer so his next

58
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:07,520
does not have a next pointer so his next
 

59
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,390
does not have a next pointer so his next
will be

60
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:08,400
will be
 

61
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,350
will be
num right his next will be now so can

62
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:11,360
num right his next will be now so can
 

63
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,469
num right his next will be now so can
you tell me

64
00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:12,479
you tell me
 

65
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,749
you tell me
how how to find the meter of it meter so

66
00:01:15,749 --> 00:01:15,759
how how to find the meter of it meter so
 

67
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,030
how how to find the meter of it meter so
today will be

68
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:17,040
today will be
 

69
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,190
today will be
meter of the increase meter of the hour

70
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:21,200
meter of the increase meter of the hour
 

71
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,390
meter of the increase meter of the hour
can you think of a way let uh how it

72
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:24,400
can you think of a way let uh how it
 

73
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,030
can you think of a way let uh how it
uh how we compute the middle of the

74
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:27,040
uh how we compute the middle of the
 

75
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,550
uh how we compute the middle of the
linked list

76
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:32,560

 

77
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,910

no i will just check here

78
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:35,920
no i will just check here
 

79
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,270
no i will just check here
yeah any any thoughts like if we

80
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:39,280
yeah any any thoughts like if we
 

81
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,389
yeah any any thoughts like if we
if you are only given the head of the

82
00:01:42,389 --> 00:01:42,399
if you are only given the head of the
 

83
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,230
if you are only given the head of the
head of the uh of the linked list

84
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:46,240
head of the uh of the linked list
 

85
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,670
head of the uh of the linked list
and then you you how do you get these

86
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:49,680
and then you you how do you get these
 

87
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,870
and then you you how do you get these
oh yeah oh yeah you just see one two

88
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:52,880
oh yeah oh yeah you just see one two
 

89
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,990
oh yeah oh yeah you just see one two
three four five

90
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:54,000
three four five
 

91
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,109
three four five
and what's the last one like yes

92
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:57,119
and what's the last one like yes
 

93
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,910
and what's the last one like yes
the last one is five and the first one

94
00:01:59,910 --> 00:01:59,920
the last one is five and the first one
 

95
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,469
the last one is five and the first one
is one

96
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:00,479
is one
 

97
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,789
is one
you have one at five and you divided by

98
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:02,799
you have one at five and you divided by
 

99
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,830
you have one at five and you divided by
two right

100
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:06,840

 

101
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,180

yep

102
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:08,190
yep
 

103
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:14,710
yep
[Music]

104
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:14,720

 

105
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,630

but you don't know how many are they all

106
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:16,640
but you don't know how many are they all
 

107
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,430
but you don't know how many are they all
right yeah you need to count them

108
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:19,440
right yeah you need to count them
 

109
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,550
right yeah you need to count them
yeah yeah okay so yeah you're given

110
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:22,560
yeah yeah okay so yeah you're given
 

111
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,750
yeah yeah okay so yeah you're given
then the first one and then last one

112
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:25,760
then the first one and then last one
 

113
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,309
then the first one and then last one
and then you add them together then you

114
00:02:28,309 --> 00:02:28,319
and then you add them together then you
 

115
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,630
and then you add them together then you
divide by two

116
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:30,640
divide by two
 

117
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,750
divide by two
add them together okay so i uh

118
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:33,760
add them together okay so i uh
 

119
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,470
add them together okay so i uh
i think your idea is to go through these

120
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:36,480
i think your idea is to go through these
 

121
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,790
i think your idea is to go through these
lists once and find out how many notes

122
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:38,800
lists once and find out how many notes
 

123
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,550
lists once and find out how many notes
yeah and then for example if i turn

124
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:40,560
yeah and then for example if i turn
 

125
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,630
yeah and then for example if i turn
those and then you know 10 divided by

126
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:42,640
those and then you know 10 divided by
 

127
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,229
those and then you know 10 divided by
2 is 5 then you can get it right

128
00:02:46,229 --> 00:02:46,239
2 is 5 then you can get it right
 

129
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,470
2 is 5 then you can get it right
yeah you can follow and you can go

130
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:48,480
yeah you can follow and you can go
 

131
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,270
yeah you can follow and you can go
another time yeah either way another

132
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:51,280
another time yeah either way another
 

133
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,110
another time yeah either way another
times and then you you'll find a meter

134
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:53,120
times and then you you'll find a meter
 

135
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,790
times and then you you'll find a meter
yeah that's a great great idea yes

136
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:54,800
yeah that's a great great idea yes
 

137
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,910
yeah that's a great great idea yes
do you get it no so there are links you

138
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:57,920
do you get it no so there are links you
 

139
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,430
do you get it no so there are links you
want to find the meter first of all you

140
00:02:59,430 --> 00:02:59,440
want to find the meter first of all you
 

141
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,390
want to find the meter first of all you
can go through once

142
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:00,400
can go through once
 

143
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,990
can go through once
and find out how many nodes are there in

144
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:02,000
and find out how many nodes are there in
 

145
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,070
and find out how many nodes are there in
a linked list and once you've got the

146
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:04,080
a linked list and once you've got the
 

147
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,270
a linked list and once you've got the
number you can you know

148
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:05,280
number you can you know
 

149
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,110
number you can you know
half of it right which is the middle and

150
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:07,120
half of it right which is the middle and
 

151
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,710
half of it right which is the middle and
then you go another time

152
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:08,720
then you go another time
 

153
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,430
then you go another time
which is the middle of the increase

154
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:13,440

 

155
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,229

yeah so do you have a better idea i mean

156
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:16,239
yeah so do you have a better idea i mean
 

157
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:16,710
yeah so do you have a better idea i mean
so

158
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:16,720
so
 

159
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,110
so
this you need to go through this the

160
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:19,120
this you need to go through this the
 

161
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,070
this you need to go through this the
linked list twice

162
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:20,080
linked list twice
 

163
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,309
linked list twice
right because first of all you need to

164
00:03:22,309 --> 00:03:22,319
right because first of all you need to
 

165
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,309
right because first of all you need to
first time you need to go through these

166
00:03:24,309 --> 00:03:24,319
first time you need to go through these
 

167
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,550
first time you need to go through these
once final how many notes and then you

168
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:26,560
once final how many notes and then you
 

169
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,149
once final how many notes and then you
go through the second

170
00:03:28,149 --> 00:03:28,159
go through the second
 

171
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,869
go through the second
yeah so you need to go 1.5 times

172
00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:32,879
yeah so you need to go 1.5 times
 

173
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,149
yeah so you need to go 1.5 times
the banana no no no okay so

174
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:36,159
the banana no no no okay so
 

175
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,070
the banana no no no okay so
we just need to divide by two yeah

176
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:38,080
we just need to divide by two yeah
 

177
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,589
we just need to divide by two yeah
that's a good solution

178
00:03:39,589 --> 00:03:39,599
that's a good solution
 

179
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,550
that's a good solution
but we can do better how can we do that

180
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:42,560
but we can do better how can we do that
 

181
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,270
but we can do better how can we do that
so we have

182
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:43,280
so we have
 

183
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,830
so we have
two pointers we can have two one is fast

184
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:47,840
two pointers we can have two one is fast
 

185
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,270
two pointers we can have two one is fast
the other is slow

186
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:51,280

 

187
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,869

no solo every time they are this one is

188
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:54,879
no solo every time they are this one is
 

189
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,390
no solo every time they are this one is
twice as fast as this one

190
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:56,400
twice as fast as this one
 

191
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,990
twice as fast as this one
and this one when they reach the end

192
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:58,000
and this one when they reach the end
 

193
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,149
and this one when they reach the end
this very one was

194
00:04:00,149 --> 00:04:00,159
this very one was
 

195
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,030
this very one was
yes look this fast will be like a rabbit

196
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,040
yes look this fast will be like a rabbit
 

197
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,149
yes look this fast will be like a rabbit
the slow will be

198
00:04:04,149 --> 00:04:04,159
the slow will be
 

199
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,630
the slow will be
taller and the rabbit is twice as fast

200
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:08,640
taller and the rabbit is twice as fast
 

201
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,750
taller and the rabbit is twice as fast
as tortoise

202
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:09,760
as tortoise
 

203
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,630
as tortoise
so look if this right hand is total and

204
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:12,640
so look if this right hand is total and
 

205
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,070
so look if this right hand is total and
what left hand is

206
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:14,080
what left hand is
 

207
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,509
what left hand is
a little bit so like look okay

208
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:17,519
a little bit so like look okay
 

209
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,749
a little bit so like look okay
yeah like the knees knees twice yes yes

210
00:04:21,749 --> 00:04:21,759
yeah like the knees knees twice yes yes
 

211
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,749
yeah like the knees knees twice yes yes
and then moves one okay you reach the

212
00:04:23,749 --> 00:04:23,759
and then moves one okay you reach the
 

213
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,990
and then moves one okay you reach the
end so this is the middle okay

214
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,000
end so this is the middle okay
 

215
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,510
end so this is the middle okay
yes it's supposed to be

216
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:29,520
yes it's supposed to be
 

217
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,990
yes it's supposed to be
yeah yeah it could be least or this it

218
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:32,000
yeah yeah it could be least or this it
 

219
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,749
yeah yeah it could be least or this it
doesn't matter okay so look

220
00:04:33,749 --> 00:04:33,759
doesn't matter okay so look
 

221
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,830
doesn't matter okay so look
uh one yeah

222
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:37,840
uh one yeah
 

223
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:45,750
uh one yeah
this twice yes and then twice

224
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:45,760

then then that than that

228
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,000

 

229
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,790

well i'm confused but but now the the

230
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:04,800
well i'm confused but but now the the
 

231
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,670
well i'm confused but but now the the
thing is that

232
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:05,680
thing is that
 

233
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:12,260
thing is that
the rabbit is twice as fast as

234
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:12,270

 

235

237
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,790

oh my god this is a bit tricky to do

238
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:26,800
oh my god this is a bit tricky to do
 

239
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,950
oh my god this is a bit tricky to do
probably not using this okay

240
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:30,960

 

241
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,070

so let let's do the middle define

242
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:34,080
so let let's do the middle define
 

243
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,469
so let let's do the middle define
weight mid of the linkage and we're

244
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:36,479
weight mid of the linkage and we're
 

245
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:37,510
weight mid of the linkage and we're
given a hand

246
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:37,520
given a hand
 

247
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,629
given a hand
yeah what's missing here

248
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:40,639
yeah what's missing here
 

249
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,550
yeah what's missing here
okay so now we have a fast first as well

250
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:44,560
okay so now we have a fast first as well
 

251
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,950
okay so now we have a fast first as well
which is also equal to we don't need

252
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:46,960
which is also equal to we don't need
 

253
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,150
which is also equal to we don't need
that projector

254
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:48,160
that projector
 

255
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,189
that projector
wait wait wait okay instead of just one

256
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:51,199
wait wait wait okay instead of just one
 

257
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:51,670
wait wait wait okay instead of just one
thing

258
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:51,680
thing
 

259
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,990
thing
yeah then we're going to do it in the

260
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:54,000
yeah then we're going to do it in the
 

261
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,110
yeah then we're going to do it in the
coding part right now

262
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:55,120
coding part right now
 

263
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,550

yes and then then why

264
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:58,560
yes and then then why

271
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,870

and fast fast and fast next okay

272
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:14,880
and fast fast and fast next okay
 

273
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,830
and fast fast and fast next okay
first and fast the

274
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:18,840
first and fast the
 

275
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,430
first and fast the
next fast is not

276
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:21,440
next fast is not
 

277
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,710
next fast is not
now and first but that is not long

278
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:24,720
now and first but that is not long
 

279
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,390
now and first but that is not long
yeah i know but because of the heat and

280
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:26,400
yeah i know but because of the heat and
 

281
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,710
yeah i know but because of the heat and
then look then fast

282
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:28,720
then look then fast
 

283
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,710
then look then fast
equals fast top next

284
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:32,720
equals fast top next
 

285
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,909
equals fast top next
next yeah yeah it travels twice and then

286
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:35,919
next yeah yeah it travels twice and then
 

287
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,670
next yeah yeah it travels twice and then
slow

288
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:37,680
slow
 

289
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,909
slow
equals slow down next

290
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:41,919
equals slow down next
 

291
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,710
equals slow down next
and then return what when the first stop

292
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:44,720
and then return what when the first stop
 

293
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,830
and then return what when the first stop
next

294
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:46,840

what's the complexity still one right
 

299
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,430
what's the complexity still one right
yeah and but you only tried was half uh

300
00:06:59,430 --> 00:06:59,440
yeah and but you only tried was half uh
 

301
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,309
yeah and but you only tried was half uh
once one time right how does a login

302
00:07:02,309 --> 00:07:02,319
once one time right how does a login
 

303
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,830
once one time right how does a login
no there's no lock then you know it's

00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:03,840
no there's no lock then you know it's
 

305
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,909
no there's no lock then you know it's
just one thing to this list

remember yeah remember yesterday we
talked about this we create a new node

374
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:54,080
talked about this we create a new node
 

375
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,910
talked about this we create a new node
which is node

376
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:55,920
which is node
 

377
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,430
which is node
which is why there's a gap

378
00:08:59,430 --> 00:08:59,440
which is why there's a gap
 

379
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,590

to
 

445
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,949
to
we we want to find the middle of it

446
00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:34,959
we we want to find the middle of it
 

447
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:35,509
we we want to find the middle of it
right

448
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:35,519
right
 

449
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:41,350
right
yeah so let's let's do this first

450
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:41,360

 

451
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,550

let's do this define meter of the

452
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:44,560
let's do this define meter of the
 

453
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,829
let's do this define meter of the
link list and remember fast slow

454
00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:47,839
link list and remember fast slow
 

455
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,190
link list and remember fast slow
equals head head right okay

456
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:51,200
equals head head right okay
 

457
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,509
equals head head right okay
why fast is

458
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:55,519
why fast is
 

459
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,190
why fast is
not non and first

460
00:10:59,190 --> 00:10:59,200
not non and first
 

461
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,990
not non and first
next is not none right

462
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:04,000

 

463
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,350

okay and then fast equals five stop next

464
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:07,360
okay and then fast equals five stop next
 

465
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,470
okay and then fast equals five stop next
dot next right right and the slow will

466
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:10,480
dot next right right and the slow will
 

467
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:10,790
dot next right right and the slow will
be

468
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:10,800
be
 

469
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,430
be
slow the next all right yeah and return

470
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:13,440
slow the next all right yeah and return
 

471
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,230
slow the next all right yeah and return
slow right

472
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:14,240
slow right
 

473
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,990
slow right
yeah okay let's let's do it look

474
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:18,000
yeah okay let's let's do it look
 

475
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,509

let's do it so there's meat uh the meat
 

477
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,870
let's do it so there's meat uh the meat
note is meat of the head and then let's

478
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:24,880
note is meat of the head and then let's
 

479
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,389
note is meat of the head and then let's
let's put that what do you think the

480
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:26,399
let's put that what do you think the
 

481

let's put that what do you think the
meat will be

482
00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:28,079
meat will be
 

483
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,269
meat will be
the minute will be five five or six
