1
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,070

okay so today we'll talk about the

2
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:10,080
okay so today we'll talk about the
 

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,110
okay so today we'll talk about the
three different aquariums to solve the

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:13,120
three different aquariums to solve the
 

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,870
three different aquariums to solve the
problem which is called max

6
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:14,880
problem which is called max
 

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,070
problem which is called max
sub array sum next

8
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:18,080
sub array sum next
 

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,670
sub array sum next
sub array

10
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:21,680

 

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,950

okay so given a list of numbers like 1

12
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:24,960
okay so given a list of numbers like 1
 

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,669
okay so given a list of numbers like 1
3 minus 5 6 0

14
00:00:29,669 --> 00:00:29,679
3 minus 5 6 0
 

15
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,790
3 minus 5 6 0
one okay so we want to find out

16
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:32,800
one okay so we want to find out
 

17
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,389
one okay so we want to find out
let's max the sub list the sum of the

18
00:00:36,389 --> 00:00:36,399
let's max the sub list the sum of the
 

19
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:37,350
let's max the sub list the sum of the
maximum

20
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:37,360
maximum
 

21
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,470
maximum
uh sub list yeah the sub list sum

22
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:40,480
uh sub list yeah the sub list sum
 

23
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,310
uh sub list yeah the sub list sum
which is the service which has the

24
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:42,320
which is the service which has the
 

25
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,150
which is the service which has the
largest sum

26
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:44,160
largest sum
 

27
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,590
largest sum
so what's sublist what's up this

28
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:47,600
so what's sublist what's up this
 

29
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,790
so what's sublist what's up this
can you say tell me what's sublist

30
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:50,800
can you say tell me what's sublist
 

31
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,430
can you say tell me what's sublist
and what how how is the difference with

32
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:53,440
and what how how is the difference with
 

33
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:53,830
and what how how is the difference with
sub

34
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:53,840
sub
 

35
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:02,950
sub
subsequence the frequency is the

36
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:02,960

 

37
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,109

subsequent remember we talked about uh

38
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:07,119

 

39
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,109

we talked about the subsequence planning

40
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:09,119
we talked about the subsequence planning
 

41
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,149
we talked about the subsequence planning
yeah the longest

42
00:01:10,149 --> 00:01:10,159
yeah the longest
 

43
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,469
yeah the longest
planet yeah so what's the sub list

44
00:01:14,469 --> 00:01:14,479
planet yeah so what's the sub list
 

45
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,990
planet yeah so what's the sub list
continuous consecutive yeah and plus

46
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:18,000
continuous consecutive yeah and plus
 

47
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,870
continuous consecutive yeah and plus
sequence

48
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:18,880
sequence
 

49
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,109
sequence
can be any yeah for example the surface

50
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:21,119
can be any yeah for example the surface
 

51
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,310
can be any yeah for example the surface
is one three

52
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:22,320
is one three
 

53
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,550
is one three
one three five minus five three minus

54
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:24,560
one three five minus five three minus
 

55
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,230
one three five minus five three minus
five three minus five six so basically

56
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:26,240
five three minus five six so basically
 

57
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,510
five three minus five six so basically
you pick two ranges

58
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:27,520
you pick two ranges
 

59
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,230
you pick two ranges
you pick two power and then yeah yeah

60
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:30,240
you pick two power and then yeah yeah
 

61
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,670
you pick two power and then yeah yeah
yeah

62
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:31,680
yeah
 

63
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,069
yeah
we're done yeah consecutive so it has to

64
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:34,079
we're done yeah consecutive so it has to
 

65
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,310
we're done yeah consecutive so it has to
be consecutive elements but subsequence

66
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:36,320
be consecutive elements but subsequence
 

67
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,469
be consecutive elements but subsequence
is not right you can pick one minus five

68
00:01:38,469 --> 00:01:38,479
is not right you can pick one minus five
 

69
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,510
is not right you can pick one minus five
zero y

70
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:39,520
zero y
 

71
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,749
zero y
you can pick three minus one right so

72
00:01:41,749 --> 00:01:41,759
you can pick three minus one right so
 

73
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,270
you can pick three minus one right so
you you'll get

74
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:43,280
you you'll get
 

75
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,710
you you'll get
one three six okay so the task is to

76
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:46,720
one three six okay so the task is to
 

77
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,190
one three six okay so the task is to
find the sub list which has the largest

78
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:49,200
find the sub list which has the largest
 

79
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,710
find the sub list which has the largest
sum okay so any

80
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:52,720
sum okay so any
 

81
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,069
sum okay so any
i mean if if the number even this has

82
00:01:56,069 --> 00:01:56,079
i mean if if the number even this has
 

83
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,990
i mean if if the number even this has
all the positive number what's the

84
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:58,000
all the positive number what's the
 

85
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,630
all the positive number what's the
sub list that has the largest sum all of

86
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:00,640
sub list that has the largest sum all of
 

87
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,389
sub list that has the largest sum all of
them all of it of course yeah we can

88
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:02,399
them all of it of course yeah we can
 

89
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,910
them all of it of course yeah we can
keep adding i think right

90
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:03,920
keep adding i think right
 

91
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,389
keep adding i think right
yeah and how about if the subject says

92
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:06,399
yeah and how about if the subject says
 

93
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,669
yeah and how about if the subject says
if this has only the negative numbers

94
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:09,679
if this has only the negative numbers
 

95
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,869
if this has only the negative numbers
the biggest one biggest

96
00:02:12,869 --> 00:02:12,879
the biggest one biggest
 

97
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,869
the biggest one biggest
biggest well done yeah because for

98
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:14,879
biggest well done yeah because for
 

99
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,630
biggest well done yeah because for
example like minus one minus two minus

100
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:16,640
example like minus one minus two minus
 

101
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,390
example like minus one minus two minus
three so you only you pick the

102
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:18,400
three so you only you pick the
 

103
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,150
three so you only you pick the
largest one which is minus one right

104
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:20,160
largest one which is minus one right
 

105
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,990
largest one which is minus one right
yeah and it has the largest surface

106
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,000
yeah and it has the largest surface
 

107
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,990
yeah and it has the largest surface
because if you keep adding

108
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:24,000
because if you keep adding
 

109
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,990
because if you keep adding
then you become smaller and smaller

110
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:26,000
then you become smaller and smaller
 

111
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,869
then you become smaller and smaller
right but if you pick minus two

112
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:28,879
right but if you pick minus two
 

113
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,630
right but if you pick minus two
you can pick minus one which is better

114
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:30,640
you can pick minus one which is better
 

115
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,869
you can pick minus one which is better
right all right okay so good

116
00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:32,879
right all right okay so good
 

117
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,630
right all right okay so good
so any idea how we can solve this

118
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:34,640
so any idea how we can solve this
 

119
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,150
so any idea how we can solve this
problem like if

120
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:36,160
problem like if
 

121
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,190
problem like if
it's reinforcing yeah we're done that's

122
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:39,200
it's reinforcing yeah we're done that's
 

123
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:39,910
it's reinforcing yeah we're done that's
a very good

124
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:39,920
a very good
 

125
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,390
a very good
way the most stupid way but sometimes

126
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:42,400
way the most stupid way but sometimes
 

127
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,070
way the most stupid way but sometimes
the most effective way right because the

128
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:44,080
the most effective way right because the
 

129
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,350
the most effective way right because the
proof forcing is the most

130
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:45,360
proof forcing is the most
 

131
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,470
proof forcing is the most
straightforward

132
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:46,480
straightforward
 

133
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,949
straightforward
most intuitive way so how can we profess

134
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:48,959
most intuitive way so how can we profess
 

135
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,150
most intuitive way so how can we profess
this problem like

136
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,160
this problem like
 

137
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,670
this problem like
justin sorry

138
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:53,680
justin sorry
 

139
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,190
justin sorry
no no how can we prove that how many

140
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:57,200
no no how can we prove that how many
 

141
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,869
no no how can we prove that how many
sublease

142
00:02:58,869 --> 00:02:58,879
sublease
 

143
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,070
sublease
positives yeah

144
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:02,080
positives yeah
 

145
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,670
positives yeah
i know but the blue forcing it doesn't

146
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:03,680
i know but the blue forcing it doesn't
 

147
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,430
i know but the blue forcing it doesn't
care about if they are not

148
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:05,440
care about if they are not
 

149
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,309
care about if they are not
positive or negative right the home but

150
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:08,319
positive or negative right the home but
 

151
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:08,949
positive or negative right the home but
we prove

152
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:08,959
we prove
 

153
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,509
we prove
us all the pairs of sublist right

154
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:11,519
us all the pairs of sublist right
 

155
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,750
us all the pairs of sublist right
because each service is determined by

156
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:13,760
because each service is determined by
 

157
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,710
because each service is determined by
two

158
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:14,720
two

160
00:03:16,149 --> 00:03:16,159
by the left boundary and the right
 

161
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,149
by the left boundary and the right
boundary right which can be easily put

162
00:03:18,149 --> 00:03:18,159
boundary right which can be easily put
 

163
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:18,630

in in two for loops there was a time

166
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:21,519
in in two for loops there was a time
 

167
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:22,869
in in two for loops there was a time
complexity

168
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:22,879

and o n square right yeah

170
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:25,920
and o n square right yeah
 

171
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,750
and o n square right yeah
o n square for the proof force in the

172
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:27,760
o n square for the proof force in the
 

173
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,949
o n square for the proof force in the
sub list yeah

174
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:28,959
sub list yeah
 

175
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:38,070
sub list yeah
so maybe um

176
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:38,080

 

177
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,670

look if we if we determine the left

178
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:41,680
look if we if we determine the left
 

179
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,390
look if we if we determine the left
boundary

180
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:42,400
boundary
 

181
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,789
boundary
yeah they'll be the left boundary will

182
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:44,799
yeah they'll be the left boundary will
 

183
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,470
yeah they'll be the left boundary will
be from zero

184
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:46,480
be from zero
 

185
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,630
be from zero
to n minus one right

186
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:50,640
to n minus one right
 

187
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,030
to n minus one right
actually minus two minus one yeah minus

188
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,040
actually minus two minus one yeah minus
 

189
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,350
actually minus two minus one yeah minus
one and then the right boundary

190
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:55,360
one and then the right boundary
 

191
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,030
one and then the right boundary
will start from the left until

192
00:03:59,030 --> 00:03:59,040
will start from the left until
 

193
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,429
will start from the left until
and minus one right right so for each

194
00:04:01,429 --> 00:04:01,439
and minus one right right so for each
 

195
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,110
and minus one right right so for each
length i can start with the right

196
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:03,120
length i can start with the right
 

197
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,229
length i can start with the right
boundary right

198
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:04,239
boundary right
 

199
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,429
boundary right
so let's be o n square right all right

200
00:04:07,429 --> 00:04:07,439
so let's be o n square right all right
 

201
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,509
so let's be o n square right all right
because if this is n minus one choice

202
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:11,519
because if this is n minus one choice
 

203
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,670
because if this is n minus one choice
actually there's n choice and for the

204
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:13,680
actually there's n choice and for the
 

205
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,550
actually there's n choice and for the
right one

206
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:14,560
right one
 

207
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,909
right one
that will be and will be n

208
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:17,919
that will be and will be n
 

209
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,670
that will be and will be n
minus n minus

210
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:21,680
minus n minus
 

211
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,950
minus n minus
look if a if left is

212
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:24,960
look if a if left is
 

213
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,510
look if a if left is
n choice and then right will be n minus

214
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:27,520
n choice and then right will be n minus
 

215
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,870
n choice and then right will be n minus
left choice

216
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:28,880
left choice
 

217
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,870
left choice
and because when n is getting when the

218
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:30,880
and because when n is getting when the
 

219
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,469
and because when n is getting when the
left is getting bigger

220
00:04:32,469 --> 00:04:32,479
left is getting bigger
 

221
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,909
left is getting bigger
so this n minus left to the right is

222
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:35,919
so this n minus left to the right is
 

223
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,110
so this n minus left to the right is
getting smaller but

224
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:37,120
getting smaller but
 

225
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,110
getting smaller but
eventually is not the number of the

226
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:41,120
eventually is not the number of the
 

227
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,310
eventually is not the number of the
number of the pairs

228
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:42,320
number of the pairs
 

229
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,830
number of the pairs
of these sublease is n

230
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:45,840
of these sublease is n
 

231
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,990
of these sublease is n
is roughly n squared divided by 2 here

232
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,000
is roughly n squared divided by 2 here
 

233
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,350
is roughly n squared divided by 2 here
but we drop the constant

234
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:49,360
but we drop the constant
 

235
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,990
but we drop the constant
so the complexity is always square to

236
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,000
so the complexity is always square to
 

237
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,110
so the complexity is always square to
find the sub list

238
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:53,120
find the sub list
 

239
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,110
find the sub list
then for each subnet we need to compute

240
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:55,120
then for each subnet we need to compute
 

241
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,550
then for each subnet we need to compute
the sum of the sub list

242
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:56,560
the sum of the sub list
 

243
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,510
the sum of the sub list
in which may take another n right so the

244
00:04:59,510 --> 00:04:59,520
in which may take another n right so the
 

245
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,430
in which may take another n right so the
overall time complexity is o and square

246
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:01,440
overall time complexity is o and square
 

247
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,110
overall time complexity is o and square
o and cubic right but

248
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:05,120
o and cubic right but
 

249
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,670
o and cubic right but
but we don't have to we calculate the

250
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:07,680
but we don't have to we calculate the
 

251
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,469
but we don't have to we calculate the
sub list

252
00:05:08,469 --> 00:05:08,479
sub list
 

253
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,950
sub list
every time we determine the suffix right

254
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:10,960
every time we determine the suffix right
 

255
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,230
every time we determine the suffix right
so for example right

256
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:12,240
so for example right
 

257
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,189
so for example right
using dynamic paragraph we're going to

258
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:15,199
using dynamic paragraph we're going to
 

259
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,950
using dynamic paragraph we're going to
remember it look if one

260
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:16,960
remember it look if one
 

261
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,670
remember it look if one
two three four the list is one two three

262
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:19,680
two three four the list is one two three
 

263
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,629
two three four the list is one two three
four right

264
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:20,639
four right
 

265
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,350
four right
right alright this is one two three four

266
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:23,360
right alright this is one two three four
 

267
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,029
right alright this is one two three four
when we determine

268
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:25,039
when we determine
 

269
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,150
when we determine
the we when we determine uh

270
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:28,160
the we when we determine uh
 

271
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,189
the we when we determine uh
the sub list one two one

272
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:31,199
the sub list one two one
 

273
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,670
the sub list one two one
one two we know if the sum is three

274
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:33,680
one two we know if the sum is three
 

275
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,310
one two we know if the sum is three
right

276
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:34,320
right
 

277
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,510
right
yeah but and then we we want to is

278
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:37,520
yeah but and then we we want to is
 

279
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,749
yeah but and then we we want to is
extend this surface to one more element

280
00:05:39,749 --> 00:05:39,759
extend this surface to one more element
 

281
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:40,870
extend this surface to one more element
now the surface

282
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:40,880
now the surface
 

283
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,189
now the surface
of new surface will be one two three

284
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:43,199
of new surface will be one two three
 

285
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,070
of new surface will be one two three
five

286
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:44,080
five
 

287
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,230
five
but when we calculate the sum of the one

288
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:46,240
but when we calculate the sum of the one
 

289
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,990
but when we calculate the sum of the one
two three we don't need to

290
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:48,000
two three we don't need to
 

291
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,909
two three we don't need to
start calculating from the beginning

292
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:49,919
start calculating from the beginning
 

293
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,029
start calculating from the beginning
because we already

294
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:51,039
because we already
 

295
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,070
because we already
know this surface new service is one

296
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:54,080
know this surface new service is one
 

297
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,710
know this surface new service is one
element

298
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:54,720
element
 

299
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,430
element
more than the previous sub list right

300
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:57,440
more than the previous sub list right
 

301
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,270
more than the previous sub list right
and the sum of the previous salaries is

302
00:05:59,270 --> 00:05:59,280
and the sum of the previous salaries is
 

303
00:05:59,280 --> 00:05:59,990
and the sum of the previous salaries is
three

304
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,000
three
 

305
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,909
three
and then i can just add another three

306
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:01,919
and then i can just add another three
 

307
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,070
and then i can just add another three
right so this will save us

308
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:04,080
right so this will save us
 

309
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,110
right so this will save us
o and time right and what's the new icon

310
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:07,120
o and time right and what's the new icon

00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:15,759
and squad yeah it's good because i
 

317
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:32,309
and squad yeah it's good because i
i just said we optimize it and

yeah oh yeah ten dollars sorry you're
 

329
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,950
yeah oh yeah ten dollars sorry you're
right yes

330
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:50,960

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,270
one million million if you turns another
thousand that will be one billion okay

340
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:05,280
thousand that will be one billion okay
 

341
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,110
thousand that will be one billion okay
yeah doesn't make sense so it's a lot

342
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:07,120
yeah doesn't make sense so it's a lot

00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:49,840
initially the answer would be a very
 

367
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,150
initially the answer would be a very
small number so we we can set it to

368
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:52,160
small number so we we can set it to
 

369
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,270
small number so we we can set it to
negative infinity right and you used to

370
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:55,280
negative infinity right and you used to
 

371
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,070
negative infinity right and you used to
know right i

372
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:56,080
know right i
 

373
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,550
know right i

00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:05,520
negative right i think in fact you can
 

383
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,990
negative right i think in fact you can
do this you can do the same as

00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:08,000
do this you can do the same as
 

385
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,110
do this you can do the same as
this you can do it with

this you can do it with
 

387
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,869
this you can do it with
mass dot i and f this is a constant okay

388
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:14,879
mass dot i and f this is a constant okay
 

389
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:15,909
mass dot i and f this is a constant okay
it's the same thing okay

390
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:15,919
it's the same thing okay
 

391
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,990
it's the same thing okay
it's it's a more straightforward right

392
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:18,000
it's it's a more straightforward right
 

393
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,189
it's it's a more straightforward right
because i want the

394
00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:19,199
because i want the
 

395
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,070
because i want the

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,509

let's iterate okay let's learn length n

402
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:33,519
let's iterate okay let's learn length n
 

403
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,029
let's iterate okay let's learn length n
equals lengths

404
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:35,039
equals lengths
 

405
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,230
equals lengths
nums right then okay

406
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:38,240
nums right then okay
 

407
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,350
nums right then okay
now look for let's say that

408
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:41,360
now look for let's say that
 

409
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,630
now look for let's say that
i i will be left moderate i in

410
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:44,640
i i will be left moderate i in
 

411
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,670
i i will be left moderate i in
range range n right

412
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:47,680
range range n right
 

413
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,790
range range n right
and then now i have determined the left

414
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:50,800
and then now i have determined the left
 

415
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,070
and then now i have determined the left
boundary i have studied

416
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:52,080
boundary i have studied
 

417
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,750
boundary i have studied
s zero which is this which is the sum of

418
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:55,760
s zero which is this which is the sum of
 

419
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,389
s zero which is this which is the sum of
the

420
00:08:56,389 --> 00:08:56,399
the
 

421
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,190
the
current sub list right and now i need to

422
00:08:59,190 --> 00:08:59,200
current sub list right and now i need to
 

423
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,550
current sub list right and now i need to
extend this

424
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:00,560
extend this
 

425
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,110
extend this
surface to the right yeah in range

426
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:05,120
surface to the right yeah in range
 

427
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,230
surface to the right yeah in range
start from i and then to m n right all

428
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:08,240
start from i and then to m n right all
 

429
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,990
start from i and then to m n right all
right

430
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,000
right
 

431
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,350
right
and then look s plus equals num

432
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:13,360
and then look s plus equals num
 

433
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,829
and then look s plus equals num
num which element

434
00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:17,839

 

435
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,590

j j and then

436
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:21,600

 

437
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,430

what happened if i got a sum then i need

438
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:23,440
what happened if i got a sum then i need
 

439
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,269
what happened if i got a sum then i need
to compare with the answer yeah

440
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:25,279
to compare with the answer yeah
 

441
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,470
to compare with the answer yeah
so if s bigger than answer what should i

442
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:28,480
so if s bigger than answer what should i
 

443
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,190
so if s bigger than answer what should i
do

444
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:29,200
do
 

445
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,269
do
then answer equals s i'll return y

446
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:33,279
then answer equals s i'll return y
 

447
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,870
then answer equals s i'll return y
and then we turn of cards

448
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:36,880
and then we turn of cards
 

449
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,350
and then we turn of cards
can we make this into the next one here

450
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:41,360
can we make this into the next one here
 

451
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,829
can we make this into the next one here
max yeah the max of also

452
00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:45,839
max yeah the max of also
 

453
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,670
max yeah the max of also
yeah we're done look because this is

454
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:47,680
yeah we're done look because this is
 

455
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,590
yeah we're done look because this is
basically we want to update the answer

456
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:49,600
basically we want to update the answer
 

457
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,750
basically we want to update the answer
to the maximum of both right

458
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:51,760
to the maximum of both right
 

459
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,949
to the maximum of both right
so i just have to do this answer

460
00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:54,959
so i just have to do this answer
 

461
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,990
so i just have to do this answer
equals max function max of what max of

462
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,000
equals max function max of what max of
 

463
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,030
equals max function max of what max of
answer and x okay it's the same or as

464
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:01,040
answer and x okay it's the same or as
 

465
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,750
answer and x okay it's the same or as
an answer so they maximum actually you

466
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:03,760
an answer so they maximum actually you
 

467
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,550
an answer so they maximum actually you
can

468
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:04,560
can
 

469
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,790
can
pass many many numbers in the max

470
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:06,800
pass many many numbers in the max
 

471
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,790
pass many many numbers in the max
function and you will return the maximum

472
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:08,800
function and you will return the maximum
 

473
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,990
function and you will return the maximum
amount of it yeah yeah okay okay so

474
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:12,000
amount of it yeah yeah okay okay so
 

475
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,430
amount of it yeah yeah okay okay so
leave this time from next

476
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:13,440
leave this time from next
 

477
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,310
leave this time from next
remind me what's the time complexity

478
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:16,320
remind me what's the time complexity
 

479
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,430
remind me what's the time complexity
square

480
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:17,440
square
 

481
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,310
square
what's the space complexity a

482
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:22,320

 

483
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,829

are we using a different additional

484
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:23,839
are we using a different additional
 

485
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,550
are we using a different additional
space yeah one constant okay that's good

486
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:26,560
space yeah one constant okay that's good
 

487
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,269
space yeah one constant okay that's good
okay so now can we do better

488
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:31,279
okay so now can we do better
 

489
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,750
okay so now can we do better
we we can do it we're using o and loop

490
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:33,760
we we can do it we're using o and loop
 

491
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,710
we we can do it we're using o and loop
okay so we we have two approaches

492
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:36,720
okay so we we have two approaches
 

493
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,030
okay so we we have two approaches
uh one is called dynamic programming the

494
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:39,040
uh one is called dynamic programming the
 

495
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,710
uh one is called dynamic programming the
other one is called greedy algorithm

496
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:40,720
other one is called greedy algorithm
 

497
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,750
other one is called greedy algorithm
they are both quite

498
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:41,760
they are both quite
 

499
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,230
they are both quite
similar in this case labels have this

500
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:44,240
similar in this case labels have this
 

501
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,030
similar in this case labels have this
owen

502
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,040
owen
 

503
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,949
owen
time and 01 space so for this

504
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:48,959
time and 01 space so for this
 

505
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,710
time and 01 space so for this
for example let's say

506
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:52,720
for example let's say
 

507
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,870
for example let's say
let's say we we uh let's say we have a

508
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:56,880
let's say we we uh let's say we have a
 

509
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,150
let's say we we uh let's say we have a
current sub list right so now

510
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:00,160
current sub list right so now
 

511
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,030
current sub list right so now
we want to consider the next element

512
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:03,040
we want to consider the next element
 

513
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,150
we want to consider the next element
right

514
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:04,160
right
 

515
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,430
right
so we can we want to consider next next

516
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:07,440
so we can we want to consider next next
 

517
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,949
so we can we want to consider next next
animal we have two choice

518
00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:08,959
animal we have two choice
 

519
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,430
animal we have two choice
we can either include this new animal in

520
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:11,440
we can either include this new animal in
 

521
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,350
we can either include this new animal in
the current subways or we start a new

522
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:13,360
the current subways or we start a new
 

523
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,230
the current subways or we start a new
subject with

524
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:14,240
subject with
 

525
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,630
subject with
this element right yeah we only have

526
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:16,640
this element right yeah we only have
 

527
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,829
this element right yeah we only have
these two choices right

528
00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:17,839
these two choices right
 

529
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,030
these two choices right
do you have another choice no right so

530
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:21,040
do you have another choice no right so
 

531
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,949
do you have another choice no right so
in this case we can do this yes so for

532
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:22,959
in this case we can do this yes so for
 

533
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,389
in this case we can do this yes so for
example like

534
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:24,399
example like
 

535
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,150
example like
one two minus three

536
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:28,160
one two minus three
 

537
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,630
one two minus three
four okay let's just try this let's try

538
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:30,640
four okay let's just try this let's try
 

539
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,269
four okay let's just try this let's try
with the sub

540
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:31,279
with the sub
 

541
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,509
with the sub
uh let's see there's an answer here and

542
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:33,519
uh let's see there's an answer here and
 

543
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,590
uh let's see there's an answer here and
then let's sub this sum okay sub list

544
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:35,600
then let's sub this sum okay sub list
 

545
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,630
then let's sub this sum okay sub list
sum

546
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:36,640
sum
 

547
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,710
sum
sub least sum i think it's four

548
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:40,720
sub least sum i think it's four
 

549
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,670
sub least sum i think it's four
okay look let's say start with one okay

550
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:43,680
okay look let's say start with one okay
 

551
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,870
okay look let's say start with one okay
one

552
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:44,880
one
 

553
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,110
one
both are one yeah the global answer is

554
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:47,120
both are one yeah the global answer is
 

555
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,230
both are one yeah the global answer is
one yeah

556
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:48,240
one yeah
 

557
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,790
one yeah
next number two i can add it which is

558
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:50,800
next number two i can add it which is
 

559
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,470
next number two i can add it which is
three

560
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:52,480
three
 

561
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,269
three
or i can pick that code oh i can pick up

562
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:55,279
or i can pick that code oh i can pick up
 

563
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,670
or i can pick that code oh i can pick up
two which is better

564
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:57,680
two which is better
 

565
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,150
two which is better
what i can pick two or i can pick one

566
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:00,160
what i can pick two or i can pick one
 

567
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:00,710
what i can pick two or i can pick one
and two which

568
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:00,720
and two which
 

569
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,389
and two which
is better uh

570
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:04,399

 

571
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,509

one and two so it's three

572
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:07,519
one and two so it's three
 

573
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,590
one and two so it's three
and then yeah makes a new record here

574
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:09,600
and then yeah makes a new record here
 

575
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,590
and then yeah makes a new record here
right and then now

576
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:11,600
right and then now
 

577
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,870
right and then now
minus three zero zero oh

578
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:14,880
minus three zero zero oh
 

579
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,110
minus three zero zero oh
my my i can pick minus three alone or i

580
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:17,120
my my i can pick minus three alone or i
 

581
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,269
my my i can pick minus three alone or i
can pick i can use the previous my

582
00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:19,279
can pick i can use the previous my
 

583
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,590
can pick i can use the previous my
plus minus three so it's zero right yeah

584
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:21,600
plus minus three so it's zero right yeah
 

585
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,269
plus minus three so it's zero right yeah
which is better zero it's better i put a

586
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:23,279
which is better zero it's better i put a
 

587
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,150
which is better zero it's better i put a
t over here and then

588
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:24,160
t over here and then
 

589
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,670
t over here and then
still this is three because it's not

590
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:25,680
still this is three because it's not
 

591
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,829
still this is three because it's not
bigger than three okay then

592
00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:27,839
bigger than three okay then
 

593
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,509
bigger than three okay then
four zero plus four or i can pick pick

594
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:31,519
four zero plus four or i can pick pick
 

595
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,629
four zero plus four or i can pick pick
and four

596
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:32,639
and four
 

597
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,230
and four
it's the same right it makes the same

598
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:34,240
it's the same right it makes the same
 

599
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,230
it's the same right it makes the same
answer it's the same because you can

600
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:36,240
answer it's the same because you can
 

601
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,069
answer it's the same because you can
you can edit okay there you go you can

602
00:12:38,069 --> 00:12:38,079
you can edit okay there you go you can
 

603
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,829
you can edit okay there you go you can
pick one so it's the same answer it's

604
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:39,839
pick one so it's the same answer it's
 

605
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:40,150
pick one so it's the same answer it's
easy

606
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:40,160
easy
 

607
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,430
easy
either way okay so we got this right

608
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:43,440
either way okay so we got this right
 

609
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,509
either way okay so we got this right
let's play another so look one part one

610
00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:45,519
let's play another so look one part one
 

611
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,110
let's play another so look one part one
pass or one time right because

612
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:47,120
pass or one time right because
 

613
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,030
pass or one time right because
every time we make a decision we have

614
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:49,040
every time we make a decision we have
 

615
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,190
every time we make a decision we have
two choice we either include the next

616
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:51,200
two choice we either include the next
 

617
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,389
two choice we either include the next
number in the new

618
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:52,399
number in the new
 

619
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,030
number in the new
sublist or we start a new service with

620
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:55,040
sublist or we start a new service with
 

621
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,069
sublist or we start a new service with
it right

622
00:12:56,069 --> 00:12:56,079
it right
 

623
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,750
it right
okay let's try this formula it's quite

624
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:57,760
okay let's try this formula it's quite
 

625
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,190
okay let's try this formula it's quite
easy yeah look

626
00:12:59,190 --> 00:12:59,200
easy yeah look
 

627
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,030
easy yeah look
let's say let's say answer

628
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:03,040
let's say let's say answer
 

629
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,750
let's say let's say answer
equals the surface equals the first

630
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:05,760
equals the surface equals the first
 

631
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,030
equals the surface equals the first
number okay let's try the

632
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:07,040
number okay let's try the
 

633
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,030
number okay let's try the
first number so look you can write this

634
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:09,040
first number so look you can write this
 

635
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,870
first number so look you can write this
a equal b equals equals c

636
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:10,880
a equal b equals equals c
 

637
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,030
a equal b equals equals c
which means a equals c and b equals c

638
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:13,040
which means a equals c and b equals c
 

639
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,710
which means a equals c and b equals c
okay so in this case you can write it

640
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:14,720
okay so in this case you can write it
 

641
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,990
okay so in this case you can write it
it's the same thing as answer s equals

642
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:18,000
it's the same thing as answer s equals
 

643
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,590
it's the same thing as answer s equals
num

644
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:19,600
num
 

645
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,230
num
zero and num zero okay in person you can

646
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:22,240
zero and num zero okay in person you can
 

647
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,670
zero and num zero okay in person you can
write it two way right or you can

648
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:23,680
write it two way right or you can
 

649
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,430
write it two way right or you can
separate to that but this one is shorter

650
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:25,440
separate to that but this one is shorter
 

651
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:25,910
separate to that but this one is shorter
right

652
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:25,920
right
 

653
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,069
right
yeah does it make sense this is the same

654
00:13:28,069 --> 00:13:28,079
yeah does it make sense this is the same
 

655
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,990
yeah does it make sense this is the same
right yeah

656
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:30,000
right yeah
 

657
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,629
right yeah
yeah okay now i for the beginning i

658
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:32,639
yeah okay now i for the beginning i
 

659
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,069
yeah okay now i for the beginning i
choose the first number and then i need

660
00:13:34,069 --> 00:13:34,079
choose the first number and then i need
 

661
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,590
choose the first number and then i need
to start with the second number right

662
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:35,600
to start with the second number right
 

663
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,470
to start with the second number right
for i

664
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:36,480
for i
 

665
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,670
for i
in nums i can

666
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:39,680
in nums i can
 

667
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,110
in nums i can
i can do this start with the second

668
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:41,120
i can do this start with the second
 

669
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,990
i can do this start with the second
number right

670
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:44,000

 

671
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,310

column okay now look i can pick the

672
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:48,320
column okay now look i can pick the
 

673
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,110
column okay now look i can pick the
next number so which is s equals one

674
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:51,120
next number so which is s equals one
 

675
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,629
next number so which is s equals one
next

676
00:13:52,629 --> 00:13:52,639
next
 

677
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,030
next
take the next number which you want i

678
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:55,040
take the next number which you want i
 

679
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,069
take the next number which you want i
can only pick the

680
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:56,079
can only pick the
 

681
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,389
can only pick the
next number which is what the next

682
00:13:58,389 --> 00:13:58,399
next number which is what the next
 

683
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,870
next number which is what the next
number is

684
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:00,880
number is
 

685
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:13,110
number is
the

686
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:13,120

 

687
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,350

and then what should i do here we shall

688
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:17,360
and then what should i do here we shall
 

689
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,790
and then what should i do here we shall
which what do we do what should we do

690
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:20,800
which what do we do what should we do
 

691
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,470
which what do we do what should we do
now we have the current so we want to

692
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:22,480
now we have the current so we want to
 

693
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,150
now we have the current so we want to
check if it's bigger than the global

694
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:24,160
check if it's bigger than the global
 

695
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,150
check if it's bigger than the global
answer right yeah so we can say if s is

696
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:26,160
answer right yeah so we can say if s is
 

697
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,230
answer right yeah so we can say if s is
bigger than answer then answer equals x

698
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:28,240
bigger than answer then answer equals x
 

699
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,230
bigger than answer then answer equals x
or we can use the max function which is

700
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:30,240
or we can use the max function which is
 

701
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,710
or we can use the max function which is
what

702
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:32,720

 

703
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:39,269

answer equals max of s

704
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:39,279

 

705
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,790

what's missing

706
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:42,800

 

707
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,069

what's the timetable actually what's the

708
00:14:46,069 --> 00:14:46,079
what's the timetable actually what's the
 

709
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,030
what's the timetable actually what's the
spectrometer

710
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:47,040
spectrometer
 

711
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,550
spectrometer
oh one okay well so look this is this is

712
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:50,560
oh one okay well so look this is this is
 

713
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,550
oh one okay well so look this is this is
the dynamic programming okay

714
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:52,560
the dynamic programming okay
 

715
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,350
the dynamic programming okay
yeah because this one is we are making a

716
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:55,360
yeah because this one is we are making a
 

717
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,150
yeah because this one is we are making a
dynamic

718
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:56,160
dynamic
 

719
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,829
dynamic
programming choice we pick we pick

720
00:14:59,829 --> 00:14:59,839
programming choice we pick we pick
 

721
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,949
programming choice we pick we pick
we pick this the next element oh we can

722
00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:02,959
we pick this the next element oh we can
 

723
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,389
we pick this the next element oh we can
pick or we start with the new list right

724
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:06,399
pick or we start with the new list right
 

725
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,069
pick or we start with the new list right
yeah we only have at least two choice

726
00:15:08,069 --> 00:15:08,079
yeah we only have at least two choice
 

727
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,230
yeah we only have at least two choice
right you don't have any rituals okay

728
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:10,240
right you don't have any rituals okay
 

729
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,030
right you don't have any rituals okay
okay so now there's another approach

730
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:13,040
okay so now there's another approach
 

731
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,389
okay so now there's another approach
called gritty

732
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:14,399
called gritty
 

733
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,509
called gritty
grading yeah

734
00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:17,519
grading yeah
 

735
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,750
grading yeah
greedy so so it's quite similar to

736
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:19,760
greedy so so it's quite similar to
 

737
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,509
greedy so so it's quite similar to
dynamic programming except that we have

738
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:21,519
dynamic programming except that we have
 

739
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:21,750
dynamic programming except that we have
a

740
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:21,760
a
 

741
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,389
a
current sum and then we only added the

742
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:24,399
current sum and then we only added the
 

743
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:25,750
current sum and then we only added the
next number if

744
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:25,760
next number if
 

745
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,110
next number if
the current sum is greater or equal than

746
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:29,120
the current sum is greater or equal than
 

747
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:29,990
the current sum is greater or equal than
zero

748
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:30,000
zero
 

749
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,550
zero
if it's negative we start the next

750
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:32,560
if it's negative we start the next
 

751
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,829
if it's negative we start the next
element as the

752
00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:33,839
element as the
 

753
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,230
element as the
uh the sum okay so for example let's say

754
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:36,240
uh the sum okay so for example let's say
 

755
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,430
uh the sum okay so for example let's say
this

756
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:37,440
this
 

757
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,870
this
one minus two

758
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:40,880
one minus two
 

759
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,910
one minus two
three minus four five okay let's do this

760
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:43,920
three minus four five okay let's do this
 

761
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,389
three minus four five okay let's do this
okay

762
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:44,399
okay
 

763
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,310
okay
so now we have the answer here we have a

764
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:48,320
so now we have the answer here we have a
 

765
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,350
so now we have the answer here we have a
current sum okay current sum current sum

766
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:51,360
current sum okay current sum current sum
 

767
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,269
current sum okay current sum current sum
let's just do x

768
00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:55,279
let's just do x
 

769
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,310
let's just do x
s equals 1 yeah

770
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:58,320
s equals 1 yeah
 

771
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,430
s equals 1 yeah
s equals 1 yeah the current sum is 1 and

772
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:01,440
s equals 1 yeah the current sum is 1 and
 

773
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,110
s equals 1 yeah the current sum is 1 and
the answer is 1 right

774
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:03,120
the answer is 1 right
 

775
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,590
the answer is 1 right
minus s minus 1 plus minus 2 is minus

776
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:07,600
minus s minus 1 plus minus 2 is minus
 

777
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:07,910
minus s minus 1 plus minus 2 is minus
one

778
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:07,920
one
 

779
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:12,230
one
right okay i put a minus one here i

780
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:12,240
right okay i put a minus one here i
 

781
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,670
right okay i put a minus one here i
think

782
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:13,680
think
 

783
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,470
think
you think yeah i put a minus one here

784
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:16,480
you think yeah i put a minus one here
 

785
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,509
you think yeah i put a minus one here
and it's still one

786
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:17,519
and it's still one
 

787
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,350
and it's still one
and now s is smaller than zero

788
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:21,360
and now s is smaller than zero
 

789
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,509
and now s is smaller than zero
so i don't add the next number i start

790
00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:23,519
so i don't add the next number i start
 

791
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,110
so i don't add the next number i start
with the next number

792
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:25,120
with the next number
 

793
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,350
with the next number
yeah because now it's negative i don't

794
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:27,360
yeah because now it's negative i don't
 

795
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,829
yeah because now it's negative i don't
want to keep this negative sum

796
00:16:29,829 --> 00:16:29,839
want to keep this negative sum
 

797
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,509
want to keep this negative sum
so i will start with next number which

798
00:16:31,509 --> 00:16:31,519
so i will start with next number which
 

799
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,189
so i will start with next number which
is three right

800
00:16:33,189 --> 00:16:33,199
is three right
 

801
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,910
is three right
and then this is bigger okay three minus

802
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:35,920
and then this is bigger okay three minus
 

803
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,350
and then this is bigger okay three minus
four

804
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:37,360
four
 

805
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,910
four
yeah because three is positive right the

806
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:39,920
yeah because three is positive right the
 

807
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,990
yeah because three is positive right the
sum is positive i can add it and which

808
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:42,000
sum is positive i can add it and which
 

809
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,150
sum is positive i can add it and which
is minus one

810
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:44,160
is minus one
 

811
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,110
is minus one
three okay and again now my my running

812
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:47,120
three okay and again now my my running
 

813
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,790
three okay and again now my my running
sum this is called running somewhere the

814
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:48,800
sum this is called running somewhere the
 

815
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,749
sum this is called running somewhere the
coming some yeah

816
00:16:49,749 --> 00:16:49,759
coming some yeah
 

817
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:54,310
coming some yeah
minus one so if the sum is negative

818
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:54,320
minus one so if the sum is negative
 

819
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,030
minus one so if the sum is negative
it means that i don't want to keep these

820
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:57,040
it means that i don't want to keep these
 

821
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,629
it means that i don't want to keep these
i don't want to keep these

822
00:16:58,629 --> 00:16:58,639
i don't want to keep these
 

823
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,189
i don't want to keep these
uh negative some array and i will jump i

824
00:17:01,189 --> 00:17:01,199
uh negative some array and i will jump i
 

825
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:17,029
uh negative some array and i will jump i
will use the next one which is five

826
00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:17,039

 

827
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,189

no no no we can't because this is not

828
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:19,199
no no no we can't because this is not
 

829
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,309
no no no we can't because this is not
equal to zero

830
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:20,319
equal to zero
 

831
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,870
equal to zero
right yeah yeah this is also work so

832
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:22,880
right yeah yeah this is also work so
 

833
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,630
right yeah yeah this is also work so
this is based on the fact that

834
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:24,640
this is based on the fact that
 

835
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,549
this is based on the fact that
we don't want to keep the negative

836
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:28,559
we don't want to keep the negative
 

837
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,549
we don't want to keep the negative
sublet the sum is the negative sum right

838
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:32,559
sublet the sum is the negative sum right
 

839
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,190
sublet the sum is the negative sum right
when it's negative sum we just jump to

840
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:35,200
when it's negative sum we just jump to
 

841
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,230
when it's negative sum we just jump to
the next one right

842
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:36,240
the next one right
 

843
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,909
the next one right
yes we start with a new one okay so

844
00:17:37,909 --> 00:17:37,919
yes we start with a new one okay so
 

845
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,150
yes we start with a new one okay so
let's it's it's quite similar but it's

846
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:40,160
let's it's it's quite similar but it's
 

847
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,190
let's it's it's quite similar but it's
slightly different than the diameter

848
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:43,200
slightly different than the diameter
 

849
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,029
slightly different than the diameter
yes it always well good question it

850
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:45,039
yes it always well good question it
 

851
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,029
yes it always well good question it
always works yeah

852
00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:47,039
always works yeah
 

853
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,230
always works yeah
because even a thumb is negative i can

854
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:50,240
because even a thumb is negative i can
 

855
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,110
because even a thumb is negative i can
i prefer to start with a new one right

856
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:53,120
i prefer to start with a new one right
 

857
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:53,590
i prefer to start with a new one right
yeah

858
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:53,600
yeah
 

859
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,510
yeah
yeah does it make sense it's a bit

860
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:55,520
yeah does it make sense it's a bit
 

861
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,430
yeah does it make sense it's a bit
harder to understand but

862
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:57,440
harder to understand but
 

863
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,510
harder to understand but
with the name programming is easy to

864
00:17:59,510 --> 00:17:59,520
with the name programming is easy to
 

865
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,710
with the name programming is easy to
understand right yeah

866
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:00,720
understand right yeah
 

867
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,870
understand right yeah
okay don't worry if you can't get it out

868
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:02,880
okay don't worry if you can't get it out
 

869
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,630
okay don't worry if you can't get it out
it's a little bit tricky

870
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:04,640
it's a little bit tricky
 

871
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,029
it's a little bit tricky
right little bit think about it when

872
00:18:07,029 --> 00:18:07,039
right little bit think about it when
 

873
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,870
right little bit think about it when
you're at school when you don't have

874
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:08,880
you're at school when you don't have
 

875
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,270
you're at school when you don't have
anything to do you just think why it

876
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:11,280
anything to do you just think why it
 

877
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,870
anything to do you just think why it
works okay

878
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:12,880
works okay
 

879
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,350
works okay
yeah think about it and and if you don't

880
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:15,360
yeah think about it and and if you don't
 

881

okay look let's
 

889
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,150
okay look let's
sum equals sum equals one

890
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:26,160
sum equals sum equals one
 

891
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,830
sum equals sum equals one
zero answer equals

892
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:29,840
zero answer equals
 

893
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:35,830
zero answer equals

895
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,870

okay now let's do this for i

896
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:38,880
okay now let's do this for i
 

897
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,230

if s bigger or equal
 

907
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,909
if s bigger or equal
zero then i will add it the next number

908
00:18:55,909 --> 00:18:55,919
zero then i will add it the next number
 

909

yeah and then here answer equals

930
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:17,440
yeah and then here answer equals
 

931
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,830
yeah and then here answer equals
max answer and what

max answer and what
 

933
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:36,549
max answer and what
next answer what

934
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:36,559

 

935
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:41,430

correctly

936
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:41,440

 

937

what else could be so

944
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:53,840
what else could be so
 

945
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,150
what else could be so
if the sum is bigger than zero we add

946
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:56,160
if the sum is bigger than zero we add
 

947
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,909
if the sum is bigger than zero we add
the next number otherwise we start with

948
00:19:57,909 --> 00:19:57,919
the next number otherwise we start with
 

949
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:59,110
the next number otherwise we start with
the next number right

950
00:19:59,110 --> 00:19:59,120
the next number right
 

951
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:04,830
the next number right
yeah so which which is what s equals one

952
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:04,840

 

953
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:09,110
