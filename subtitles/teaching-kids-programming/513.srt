2
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:06,240
hello mr mr ryan are you right so we are

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:08,240
given an array of numbers right uh each

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,639
move you are allowed to pick a number

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,639
and delete all the currents of it right

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,599
so for example if we pick a two there

7
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,920
are two twos then we can remove them

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,720
so the question is that what's the

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,960
minimum number of moves that in order to

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:27,519
reduce this array to half or less 2

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,199
how i mean what number you pick

12
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,160
3

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,880
two

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,440
two moves right all three moves uh wait

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,719
wait i mean like how many numbers five

16
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,800
three

17
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,040
three

18
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,040
five uh two

19
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,559
three five and two yeah

20
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,399
first of all how many numbers did you

21
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,239
make here

22
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,320
one two three four five six seven eight

23
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,399
nine ten eleven twelve i think

24
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,480
four

25
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:57,920
eight ten so yeah

26
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,840
we want to reduce the array to half

27
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,800
right to half

28
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,040
so to five numbers or less right

29
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,040
five numbers so you pick three

30
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,119
so if we remove these

31
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,080
there are six numbers left if we pick

32
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,920
five

33
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,240
there are two numbers so it's less than

34
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,040
half of five

35
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,080
ah ah okay okay we'll pick half and then

36
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:23,520
the remaining is three numbers so we

37
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,600
only need two numbers right

38
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,000
okay so how would you solve this problem

39
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,479
i mean normally if we give it a number

40
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,240
how would you solve it counter yeah we

41
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,479
want the counter so why are we counting

42
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,600
the numbers why do we have to write them

43
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:39,439
the most popular number where the most

44
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,079
popular so we count the numbers for

45
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,079
example here three how many times

46
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:47,040
four times

47
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:48,799
uh two how many times four

48
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,439
five how many times

49
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:55,240
three seven how many times one okay so

50
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,240
how would you pick the numbers

51
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:01,040
so which numbers you pick three

52
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,680
uh-huh because these four is the largest

53
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,159
and the next one five five yeah okay

54
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,560
we're picking the numbers in such order

55
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:11,120
that you know from the popularity we

56
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,920
want to pick the numbers that are most

57
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,599
popular with the highest frequency uh to

58
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,680
the lowest frequency and now we need to

59
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,200
check yeah because when we pick this

60
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,280
number right we know that all the

61
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,480
numbers is ten numbers so we pick three

62
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,800
four numbers

63
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,360
now we pick four numbers it's not enough

64
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,040
right it's not bigger than half right

65
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,200
now we pick three numbers four past

66
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,879
three seven numbers it's more than half

67
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,480
then we return

68
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,519
two numbers right

69
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,280
all right

70
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,560
okay so culture yeah we can use the

71
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,560
comments so

72
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,519
culture is from

73
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,640
this is from collections yeah collection

74
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,400
import counter we know that already

75
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,720
counter is basically a dictionary right

76
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,400
decently we can say b equals this

77
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,800
dictionary then we go through this

78
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,040
number for i in numbers

79
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,080
this is the same thing as d i plus one

80
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,120
right

81
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,280
right all these three convert it to d

82
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,720
equals counter

83
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,480
called uh

84
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,080
numbers

85
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,040
this is just a

86
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,200
shortcut much better way to

87
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,800
make it simpler okay we have this thing

88
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,720
so we want to find out the most common

89
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,080
we want to get this part so we have this

90
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,280
function called

91
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,680
the most common we have this one so what

92
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,360
does it give us you give us

93
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,720
this

94
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:31,760
a list of uh three is four times the

95
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,720
second popular is five is three times

96
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,760
two is two times and seven is one time

97
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,120
right

98
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,040
right so look

99
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,799
most popular

100
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,400
right three appears four times five

101
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,400
appears three times right this is very

102
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,280
convenient for us right

103
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,440
so

104
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,760
we can use this most common um by

105
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,000
putting the numbers if we put a two then

106
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,000
we will return top most popular

107
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,480
this number the parameters

108
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,560
so if we want to use this command to get

109
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,640
the least comment how would you do it

110
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,640
which part is the least common

111
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,799
this is the most term

112
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,959
so so what do we do with this comment

113
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,760
for example if we do the same thing and

114
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,519
then

115
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,760
the list

116
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,840
no there's no such function called this

117
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,200
comma but we can use most comments to

118
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,079
get the least comment how would you do

119
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,600
it come on it's very nice most common

120
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,359
and

121
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,280
look this is most common so which part

122
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:26,320
about this woman what youtube cars are

123
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:29,320
these comments least common multiplier

124
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,320
um

125
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,680
yeah yeah yeah so look this is a list

126
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,759
right so this comment we just have to

127
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,440
get it from the right right for example

128
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:41,840
this command one is the minus one right

129
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,160
right uh actually minus one right so

130
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,919
even together these two

131
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,040
we can do this

132
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:51,680
uh minus two to the n and we reverse

133
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,800
this part right or we can use this uh

134
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,680
formula

135
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,600
column minus n minus one

136
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,479
minus one this means that we want to get

137
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,600
the

138
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:03,199
last and element in the reverse order

139
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,280
right because this is the least common

140
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,560
this is the second this comma right but

141
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,800
the least

142
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,280
most common just give this in the other

143
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,080
sequence we have to reverse this

144
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,840
this most common is very convenient a

145
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,400
equals

146
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,720
we have this d right the thing we need

147
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,880
is just this one and we don't care about

148
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,960
what value am i right it doesn't matter

149
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,240
right this three changes to a million

150
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,919
doesn't matter these five change to

151
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,320
a trillion doesn't matter the most

152
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:34,160
important thing is the counter how many

153
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,120
times they appear right

154
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,479
x

155
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,520
for

156
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,560
y

157
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,039
y

158
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:44,800
x in

159
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:46,639
d dot items

160
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,240
right and then we can just solve this a

161
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,720
dot solved

162
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,280
eight also what look x is the number of

163
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,840
times y is the key

164
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,919
the value indeed items and we can just

165
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,080
add a store reverse

166
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,000
equals two because we want to pick the

167
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,280
most frequent one

168
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,680
okay

169
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:09,120
and once we have this a okay so let's

170
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,800
put this in the a equal left for example

171
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,639
answer equal at the beginning we pick

172
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,160
nothing so for

173
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,199
i in

174
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,199
a okay let's assume this a is the most

175
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,280
common is this bit right so about a

176
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,759
equals

177
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,199
we want the least number right so it's y

178
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,000
for

179
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,440
x y in

180
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,600
b

181
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,240
most common right and then a will be

182
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,639
something like this for a then we add it

183
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,120
right the number we pick this is the

184
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,280
four three two one right in this case

185
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,080
the a will be four three two one it's at

186
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,280
least four three two one

187
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,759
and then

188
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,919
we want to have a counter t equals zero

189
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,199
the total numbers we have picked t plus

190
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,919
equals i

191
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,120
and answer we have picked one number and

192
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:58,000
if t

193
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,479
plus t bigger than equal and the length

194
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,759
of all the numbers

195
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:06,880
right and then we just return answer

196
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:09,280
okay make sense look yeah

197
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,919
a is four three two one four three two

198
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,080
one so we pick four numbers we check

199
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:17,280
we pick one one time we pick four

200
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,560
numbers we check if it's more than half

201
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,039
this is not more than half we keep

202
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,479
picking pixel in number now we have pick

203
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,880
seven numbers

204
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:27,520
so seven is more than half right seven

205
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,280
plus seven is bigger than ten

206
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,520
then we determine answer in this case

207
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:35,199
would be two all right the time come

208
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,199
actually it's a bit tricky

209
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,639
very close

210
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:42,639
[Music]

211
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,960
most common

212
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,960
soft

213
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:58,319
[Music]

214
00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:00,080
obviously we're using the addition rate

215
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,879
so that's one

216
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,879
we're using the dictionary oh and

217
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,360
if the numbers are within the range

218
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,800
right if the numbers for example is uh

219
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,720
bigger than one and smaller than a

220
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,319
hundred it's a lesser range then we can

221
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,240
also use the pakistan we talk about the

222
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:17,039
back is talking yeah we have a hundred

223
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,720
buckets right then we can count how many

224
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:22,080
times they appear right for example

225
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:25,039
three then we increment three bucket one

226
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,800
so in this case the numbers we have in

227
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,160
way are we in the range well now we can

228
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,319
you should package something and the

229
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,840
time complexity can be improved

230
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,000
okay so what have you learned today come

231
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,039
on what have you learned today that's it

232
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,039
about

233
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:41,399
what have you learned come on what's the

234
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,399
problem and what have you learned eric

235
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,760
so how do we reduce it i mean we use a

236
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:54,080
counter and then we have these numbers

237
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,680
yeah we have the numbers at each time we

238
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,959
can pick a

239
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,440
number and

240
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:01,600
remove one

241
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,920
of it

242
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,800
this number all of these occurrences

243
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,440
right

244
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,480
and then and then what do we need to do

245
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,600
counter

246
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,399
what do we

247
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:15,600
what are we achieving yeah

248
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:18,080
reducing the number of

249
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,800
number of numbers by half

250
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,040
so

251
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,320
we want to find out the minimum right

252
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:27,200
yeah minimum so how would you do this to

253
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,200
achieve the minimum

254
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,040
yeah this is the approach but how would

255
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,200
you do it strategically i mean how

256
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:37,040
what's a what's your approach

257
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,040
what's your approach dictionary why do

258
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:46,480
so which numbers would you pick

259
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,000
the biggest so so what are three and

260
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,320
fives the biggest

261
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,959
the what pick is this is the number this

262
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,720
is the number terminal

263
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,560
number

264
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,800
we want to pick the numbers we use the

265
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,399
highest frequency so every time we pick

266
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,920
the number with the highest frequency i

267
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,480
will remove it from the array and then

268
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,560
we pick the second highest frequency and

269
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,399
then we remove it right yeah the time

270
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,640
the next is our login because there's a

271
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,640
sorting here the most common and thought

272
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,320
right let's all know that space

273
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,240
complexity is oh and because we are

274
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,600
using a dictionary okay that's it for

275
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,839
today bye-bye

276
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,839
bye
