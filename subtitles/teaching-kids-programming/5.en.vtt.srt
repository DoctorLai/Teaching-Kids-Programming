00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:31,359
tower remember
 

19
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,750
tower remember
yeah yeah yeah sit down please

20
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:35,760
yeah yeah yeah sit down please
 

21
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,110
yeah yeah yeah sit down please
so so look the stack the important

22
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:39,120
so so look the stack the important
 

23
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,670
so so look the stack the important
thing to remember about stacks is the

24
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:41,680
thing to remember about stacks is the
 

25
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,670
thing to remember about stacks is the
every time you take the item it's always

26
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:43,680
every time you take the item it's always
 

27
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,790
every time you take the item it's always
on the top right

28
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:44,800
on the top right
 

29
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,069
on the top right
so you put the item first but you take

30
00:00:48,069 --> 00:00:48,079
so you put the item first but you take
 

31
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:48,950
so you put the item first but you take
it last

32
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:48,960
it last
 

33
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,229
it last
right yeah okay so this is called stick

34
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:52,239
right yeah okay so this is called stick
 

35
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,590
right yeah okay so this is called stick
first thing last off okay

36
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:55,600
first thing last off okay
 

37
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,189
first thing last off okay
so today we're going to introduce a

38
00:00:57,189 --> 00:00:57,199
so today we're going to introduce a
 

39
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:58,630
so today we're going to introduce a
difference

40
00:00:58,630 --> 00:00:58,640
difference
 

41
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,389
difference
different different data structure

42
00:01:00,389 --> 00:01:00,399
different different data structure
 

43
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,150
different different data structure
called queue

44
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:02,160
called queue
 

45
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,910
called queue
you notice one cube is first thing

46
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:05,920
you notice one cube is first thing
 

47
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,429
you notice one cube is first thing
first off yeah suppose you you you you

48
00:01:09,429 --> 00:01:09,439
first off yeah suppose you you you you
 

49
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,870
first off yeah suppose you you you you
wait in the line let's say yeah

50
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:12,880
wait in the line let's say yeah
 

51
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,590
wait in the line let's say yeah
yeah suppose here let's air it and

52
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:15,600
yeah suppose here let's air it and
 

53
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,710
yeah suppose here let's air it and
that's ryan

54
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:16,720
that's ryan
 

55
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,469
that's ryan
so you have to do it okay okay so look

56
00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:20,479
so you have to do it okay okay so look
 

57
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,590
so you have to do it okay okay so look
so who gets to serve the next time the

58
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:23,600
so who gets to serve the next time the
 

59
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,510
so who gets to serve the next time the
next time let's suppose we're selling a

60
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:25,520
next time let's suppose we're selling a
 

61
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,630
next time let's suppose we're selling a
ticket yeah

62
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:26,640
ticket yeah
 

63
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,270
ticket yeah
picky man that's a ticketman so who who

64
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:29,280
picky man that's a ticketman so who who
 

65
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,630
picky man that's a ticketman so who who
gets next

66
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:30,640
gets next
 

67
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,670
gets next
yo yeah eric gets next and then ryan so

68
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:33,680
yo yeah eric gets next and then ryan so
 

69
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,149
yo yeah eric gets next and then ryan so
then now the new people join the queue

70
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:36,159
then now the new people join the queue
 

71
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,870
then now the new people join the queue
yeah but they they need to wait in turn

72
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:38,880
yeah but they they need to wait in turn
 

73
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,429
yeah but they they need to wait in turn
that's call

74
00:01:39,429 --> 00:01:39,439
that's call
 

75
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,510
that's call
first thing first out right because you

76
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:41,520
first thing first out right because you
 

77
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,350
first thing first out right because you
join the two first you get served

78
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:43,360
join the two first you get served
 

79
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,190
join the two first you get served
first yes get out yeah

80
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:47,200
first yes get out yeah
 

81
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,870
first yes get out yeah
okay so again we can use the list

82
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:50,880
okay so again we can use the list
 

83
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,069
okay so again we can use the list
in python to serve the purpose of q so

84
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:54,079
in python to serve the purpose of q so
 

85
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:54,469
in python to serve the purpose of q so
in

86
00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:54,479
in
 

87
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,910
in
in the python we how do we create a list

88
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:57,920
in the python we how do we create a list
 

89
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,069
in the python we how do we create a list
we use this square bracket remember like

90
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:00,079
we use this square bracket remember like
 

91
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,350
we use this square bracket remember like
a stack yeah

92
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:01,360
a stack yeah
 

93
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,709
a stack yeah
so you can say stack equals this or you

94
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:04,719
so you can say stack equals this or you
 

95
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,030
so you can say stack equals this or you
also can have this cube

96
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:07,040
also can have this cube
 

97
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,190
also can have this cube
you q-u-u-e equals that okay

98
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:11,200
you q-u-u-e equals that okay
 

99
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,309
you q-u-u-e equals that okay
right okay so look

100
00:02:14,309 --> 00:02:14,319
right okay so look
 

101
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,990
right okay so look
so let's define a q okay let's let's

102
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:18,000
so let's define a q okay let's let's
 

103
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,990
so let's define a q okay let's let's
put a pretty simple q equals

104
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,000
put a pretty simple q equals
 

105
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,670
put a pretty simple q equals
at least and now another person joined

106
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:25,680
at least and now another person joined
 

107
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,030
at least and now another person joined

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:40,389
okay then q and then here will be l e n
stack okay okay so that's the difference

338
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:40,399
stack okay okay so that's the difference
 

339
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,670
stack okay okay so that's the difference
look at it the major difference is

340
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:43,680
look at it the major difference is
 

341
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,030
look at it the major difference is
this bit the peak this is to pick

342
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,040
this bit the peak this is to pick
 

343
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,430
this bit the peak this is to pick
to get to pick the first item this is

344
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:49,440
to get to pick the first item this is
 

345
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,870
to get to pick the first item this is
pick the last item

346
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:50,880
pick the last item
 

347
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,949
pick the last item
this is the top the first item this is

348
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:52,959
this is the top the first item this is
 

349
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,509
this is the top the first item this is
to pop the last item without a parameter

350
00:08:55,509 --> 00:08:55,519
to pop the last item without a parameter
 

351
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,430
to pop the last item without a parameter
this is with the first pair with us

352
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:57,440
this is with the first pair with us
 

353
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,070
this is with the first pair with us
so how can we make use of this queue

354
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:00,080
so how can we make use of this queue
 

355
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,710
so how can we make use of this queue
it's just

356
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:00,720
it's just
 

357
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,070
it's just
a different order right the the stack

358
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:04,080
a different order right the the stack
 

359
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,110
a different order right the the stack
is uh first thing that's all the queue

360
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:07,120
is uh first thing that's all the queue
 

361
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,829
is uh first thing that's all the queue
is first in person okay

362
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:09,839
is first in person okay
 

363
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,269
is first in person okay
okay okay so then let's

364
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:13,279
okay okay so then let's
 

365
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,190
okay okay so then let's
let's single example like we can make

366
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:15,200
let's single example like we can make
 

367
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,190
let's single example like we can make
use of the queue

368
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:17,200
use of the queue
 

369
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,110
use of the queue
define look for example if

370
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:21,120
define look for example if
 

371
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,949
define look for example if
if we given the numbers like 1 2

372
00:09:24,949 --> 00:09:24,959
if we given the numbers like 1 2
 

373
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:30,470
if we given the numbers like 1 2
3 4 5 a list yeah this is the numbers

374
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:30,480
3 4 5 a list yeah this is the numbers
 

375
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,670
3 4 5 a list yeah this is the numbers
and i want to make it return return

376
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:33,680
and i want to make it return return
 

377
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,070
and i want to make it return return
is square so that i will return one

378
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:36,080
is square so that i will return one
 

379
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,949
is square so that i will return one
square

380
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:36,959
square
 

381
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,590
square
that's two times two three times three

382
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:39,600
that's two times two three times three
 

383
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,550
that's two times two three times three
four times four

384
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:40,560
four times four
 

385
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,190
four times four
five times five okay okay this is the

386
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:43,200
five times five okay okay this is the
 

387
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,150
five times five okay okay this is the
task

388
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:44,160
task
 

389
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,829
task
so let's say define

390
00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:48,839

 

391
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:54,070

yeah he's fine let's say only define

392
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:54,080
yeah he's fine let's say only define
 

393
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,070
yeah he's fine let's say only define
square square square okay square root

394
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:58,080
square square square okay square root
 

395
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,190
square square square okay square root
square

396
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:01,200

 

397
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,590

not t square not root okay that's square

398
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:03,600
not t square not root okay that's square
 

399
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,949
not t square not root okay that's square
just square it

400
00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:04,959
just square it
 

401
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:09,350
just square it
numbers okay so how do we do it

402
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:09,360
numbers okay so how do we do it
 

403
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,829
numbers okay so how do we do it
how do we do it let's put the answer

404
00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:11,839
how do we do it let's put the answer
 

405
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,030
how do we do it let's put the answer
here okay answer

406
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:13,040
here okay answer
 

407
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,630
here okay answer
okay okay then we cannot using the

408
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:16,640
okay okay then we cannot using the
 

409
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,190
okay okay then we cannot using the
q remember while the q is not empty what

410
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:19,200
q remember while the q is not empty what
 

411
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,310
q remember while the q is not empty what
do we do

412
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:20,320
do we do
 

413
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,110
do we do
why we can treat the numbers of this we

414
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:23,120
why we can treat the numbers of this we
 

415
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,870
why we can treat the numbers of this we
can treat it as a q

416
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:24,880
can treat it as a q
 

417
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,030
can treat it as a q
y length

418
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:29,040
y length
 

419
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,630
y length
numbers bigger than zero

420
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:32,640
numbers bigger than zero
 

421
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,949
numbers bigger than zero
one nice numbers in the queue in in

422
00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:34,959
one nice numbers in the queue in in
 

423
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,230

these numbers yes
 

425
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,550
these numbers yes
we take it okay here we take one element

426
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:38,560
we take it okay here we take one element
 

427
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,069
we take it okay here we take one element
from the left

428
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:40,079
from the left
 

429
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,910
from the left
from the queue so what what you should i

430
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:41,920
from the queue so what what you should i
 

431
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,269
from the queue so what what you should i
do pop

432
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:43,279
do pop
 

433
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:53,509
do pop
x stop pop

434
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:53,519

 

435
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,030

yellow right remember we want to take

00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,040
yellow right remember we want to take
 

437
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,030
yellow right remember we want to take
the first eye item yeah

438
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,040
the first eye item yeah
 

439
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,870
the first eye item yeah
then we put it in the answer so answer

440
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:00,880
then we put it in the answer so answer
 

441
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,310
then we put it in the answer so answer
the append append

442
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:04,320
the append append
 

443
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,590
the append append
x plus one x times x y

444
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:07,600
x plus one x times x y
 

445
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,190
x plus one x times x y
we know the square yeah yeah

446
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:11,200
we know the square yeah yeah
 

447
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,870
we know the square yeah yeah
and then what's this return what

448
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:14,880
and then what's this return what
 

449
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,509
and then what's this return what
return what are we return what

450
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:19,519
return what are we return what
 

451
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,710
return what are we return what
return answer well done

452
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:22,720
return answer well done
 

453
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,069
return answer well done
okay so look what happened here

454
00:11:26,069 --> 00:11:26,079
okay so look what happened here
 

455
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,910
okay so look what happened here
look what happened here it seems it's

456
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:27,920
look what happened here it seems it's
 

457
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,990
look what happened here it seems it's
pretty simple okay so this numbers is

458
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:30,000
pretty simple okay so this numbers is
 

459
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,750
pretty simple okay so this numbers is
one two three four five

460
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:31,760
one two three four five
 

461
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,030
one two three four five
answer is empty

462
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:35,040
answer is empty
 

463
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,990
answer is empty
length and numbers is five is bigger

464
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:38,000
length and numbers is five is bigger
 

465
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,269
length and numbers is five is bigger
than zero so

466
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:39,279
than zero so
 

467
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,630
than zero so
every time i take out i take the number

468
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:42,640
every time i take out i take the number
 

469
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,230
every time i take out i take the number
the first number the left

470
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:44,240
the first number the left
 

471
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,949
the first number the left
most left left most number from the

472
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:46,959
most left left most number from the
 

473
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,389
most left left most number from the
numbers i take it

474
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:48,399
numbers i take it
 

475
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,949
numbers i take it
out i square it and put it into the

476
00:11:50,949 --> 00:11:50,959
out i square it and put it into the
 

477
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,550
out i square it and put it into the
answer and then we move it

478
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:52,560
answer and then we move it
 

479
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,470
answer and then we move it
remove because pop i wouldn't move it so

480
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:54,480
remove because pop i wouldn't move it so
 

481
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,150
remove because pop i wouldn't move it so
it will be moving

482
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:56,160
it will be moving
 

483
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,550
it will be moving
okay so one question if i want to return

484
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:58,560
okay so one question if i want to return
 

485
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,430
okay so one question if i want to return
as

486
00:11:59,430 --> 00:11:59,440
as
 

487
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,470
as
25 16 9 4

489
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,670
25 16 9 4
1 how do we do it

490
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:05,680
1 how do we do it
 

491
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,389
1 how do we do it
how do we do how do we reverse how do we

492
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:10,399
how do we do how do we reverse how do we
 

493
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,590
how do we do how do we reverse how do we
reverse

494
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:11,600
reverse
 

495
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,069
reverse
remember we we are using the kill first

496
00:12:14,069 --> 00:12:14,079
remember we we are using the kill first
 

497
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,190
remember we we are using the kill first
in first out

498
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:15,200
in first out
 

499
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,750
in first out
and now we are going to first see nassau

500
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:17,760
and now we are going to first see nassau
 

501
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,790
