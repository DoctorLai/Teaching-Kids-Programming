good good good okay that's good so today
 

7
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,510
good good good okay that's good so today
we talked about

8
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:07,520
we talked about
 

9
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,150
we talked about
we're going to come back to talk about

10
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:10,160
we're going to come back to talk about
 

11
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,150
we're going to come back to talk about
an interesting problem about the binary

12
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:12,160
an interesting problem about the binary
 

13
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,589
an interesting problem about the binary
search do you still remember what's

14
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:13,599
search do you still remember what's
 

15
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:29,189
search do you still remember what's
binary says

16
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:29,199

 

17
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,389

is smaller and the right side is bigger

18
00:00:32,389 --> 00:00:32,399
is smaller and the right side is bigger
 

19
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,310
is smaller and the right side is bigger
let's find the research so what i'm

20
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:34,320
let's find the research so what i'm
 

21
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,069
let's find the research so what i'm
talking about is finally true your own

22
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:36,079
talking about is finally true your own
 

23
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,350
talking about is finally true your own
has and most two kids

24
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:39,360
has and most two kids
 

25
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,549
has and most two kids
right yeah which one is the root

26
00:00:42,549 --> 00:00:42,559
right yeah which one is the root
 

27
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,310
right yeah which one is the root
the top one what's the number one one

28
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:46,320
the top one what's the number one one
 

29
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,229
the top one what's the number one one
okay okay so that's one the rules and

30
00:00:48,229 --> 00:00:48,239
okay okay so that's one the rules and
 

31
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,709
okay okay so that's one the rules and
which one is the leaf

32
00:00:50,709 --> 00:00:50,719
which one is the leaf
 

33
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,229
which one is the leaf
two and three the leaf there's three

34
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:54,239
two and three the leaf there's three
 

35
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,069
two and three the leaf there's three
two and four two and four we're done

36
00:00:56,069 --> 00:00:56,079
two and four two and four we're done
 

37
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,990
two and four two and four we're done
okay so how about

38
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:58,000
okay so how about
 

39
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,510
okay so how about
um let's do a little bit of review okay

40
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:01,520
um let's do a little bit of review okay
 

41
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,630
um let's do a little bit of review okay
so what's the what's the

42
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:04,640
so what's the what's the
 

43
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,870
so what's the what's the
pre-order of the final research tree you

44
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:06,880
pre-order of the final research tree you
 

45
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,870
pre-order of the final research tree you
know pre-order

46
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:08,880
know pre-order
 

47
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:23,510
know pre-order
pre-order pre-order

48
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:23,520

 

49
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,590

yeah that's it let's put all that the

50
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:25,600
yeah that's it let's put all that the
 

51
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,749
yeah that's it let's put all that the
post order

52
00:01:27,749 --> 00:01:27,759
post order
 

53
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,190
post order
uh post order so so look

54
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:31,200
uh post order so so look
 

55
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,390
uh post order so so look
this is the node yes preorder is the

56
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:34,400
this is the node yes preorder is the
 

57
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,550
this is the node yes preorder is the
left

58
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:36,560
left
 

59
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:52,830
left
what puyota is node node

60
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:52,840

 

61
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,109

one

63
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,230

is this no air left left right left

64
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:00,240
is this no air left left right left
 

65
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,510
is this no air left left right left
uh so six seven two

66
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:03,520
uh so six seven two
 

67
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,389
uh so six seven two
four five three one right oh yeah yeah

68
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:06,399
four five three one right oh yeah yeah
 

69

yeah
 

71
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,949
yeah
okay so this is a little preview about

72
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:08,959
okay so this is a little preview about
 

73
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,150
okay so this is a little preview about
this um

74
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:10,160
this um
 

75
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,070
this um
uh about the pre-order and what's the

76
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:12,080
uh about the pre-order and what's the
 

77
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,750
uh about the pre-order and what's the
binary uh what's the

78
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:13,760
binary uh what's the
 

79
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,030
binary uh what's the
breakfast search order of list three

80
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,040
breakfast search order of list three
 

81
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,790
breakfast search order of list three
breakfast search order what's breakfast

82
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:18,800
breakfast search order what's breakfast
 

83
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,430
breakfast search order what's breakfast
search oh one two three six seven four

84
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:21,440
search oh one two three six seven four
 

85
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,670
search oh one two three six seven four
five exactly level by level okay

86
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:23,680
five exactly level by level okay
 

87
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,550
five exactly level by level okay
okay so how about if i tell you that uh

88
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:26,560
okay so how about if i tell you that uh
 

89
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,589
okay so how about if i tell you that uh
you know this work

90
00:02:27,589 --> 00:02:27,599
you know this work
 

91
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,790
you know this work
and censor

92
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:30,800

 

93
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,309

what does it mean

94

95
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,229

is i think it's obviously obsessed

96
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:38,239
is i think it's obviously obsessed
 

97
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,509
is i think it's obviously obsessed
so ancestor is like uh

98
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:41,519
so ancestor is like uh
 

99
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,630
so ancestor is like uh
you the common parent

100
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:44,640

sister
yeah how about eight and seven what's

162
00:04:07,589 --> 00:04:07,599
yeah how about eight and seven what's
 

163
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,830
yeah how about eight and seven what's
the common ancestor

164
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:09,840
the common ancestor
 

165
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,750
the common ancestor
eight and seven two

166
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:13,760
eight and seven two
 

167
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,550
eight and seven two
close if if seven is ancestor is the

168
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:16,560
close if if seven is ancestor is the
 

169
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,430
close if if seven is ancestor is the
parent of a

170
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:17,440
parent of a
 

171
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,110
parent of a
you know if if one of node

172
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:21,120
you know if if one of node
 

173
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,950
you know if if one of node
is if one of knows is the grandparent

174
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:24,960
is if one of knows is the grandparent
 

175
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,950
is if one of knows is the grandparent
or parent of a nano node at least no

176
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:26,960
or parent of a nano node at least no
 

177
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,070
or parent of a nano node at least no
it's the common ancestor

178
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,080
it's the common ancestor
 

179
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,390
it's the common ancestor
lowest so seven is the lowest commerce

180
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:30,400
lowest so seven is the lowest commerce
 

181
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,070
lowest so seven is the lowest commerce
sister of seven and eight

182
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,080
sister of seven and eight
 

183
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,749
sister of seven and eight
right correct we defined it as this okay

184
00:04:35,749 --> 00:04:35,759
right correct we defined it as this okay
 

185
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,110
right correct we defined it as this okay
does it make sense okay so now

186
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:39,120
does it make sense okay so now
 

187
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,110
does it make sense okay so now
given the two notes okay so these

188
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:41,120
given the two notes okay so these
 

189
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,270
given the two notes okay so these
today's problem is given two notes

190
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:43,280
today's problem is given two notes
 

191
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,830
today's problem is given two notes
which we know it's already existent in

192
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:45,840
which we know it's already existent in
 

193
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,670
which we know it's already existent in
the binary tree okay given to know for

194
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:47,680
the binary tree okay given to know for
 

195
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,270
the binary tree okay given to know for
example

196
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:49,280
example
 

197
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,670
example
two let's do it uh

198
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:53,680
two let's do it uh
 

199
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,830
two let's do it uh
maybe here yeah okay okay nine and six

200
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:57,840
maybe here yeah okay okay nine and six
 

201
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,909
maybe here yeah okay okay nine and six
nine and six what's the common ancestor

202
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:01,919

 

203
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,029

uh two yeah yeah two oh yeah so you can

204
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:05,039
uh two yeah yeah two oh yeah so you can
 

205
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:05,749
uh two yeah yeah two oh yeah so you can
look

206
00:05:05,749 --> 00:05:05,759
look
 

207
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,670
look
you've got a minute yeah so given two

208
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:07,680
you've got a minute yeah so given two
 

209
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,670
you've got a minute yeah so given two
notes in the parallel tree we find out

210
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:09,680
notes in the parallel tree we find out
 

211
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,909
notes in the parallel tree we find out
the command the law is common ancestor

212
00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:11,919
the command the law is common ancestor
 

213
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,230
the command the law is common ancestor
so look six and nine the globe is coming

214
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:14,240
so look six and nine the globe is coming
 

215
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,990
so look six and nine the globe is coming
and success two

216
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:16,000
and success two
 

217
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,870
and success two
but this is also a command star yeah but

218
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:18,880
but this is also a command star yeah but
 

219
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,990
but this is also a command star yeah but
it's not the lowest

220
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:20,000
it's not the lowest
 

221
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,710
it's not the lowest
because this is the closest closest okay

222
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:22,720
because this is the closest closest okay
 

223
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,990
because this is the closest closest okay
which is the lowest

224
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,000
which is the lowest
 

225
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,590
which is the lowest
so any idea how we're doing this right

226
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:27,600
so any idea how we're doing this right
 

227
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,029
so any idea how we're doing this right
think think um

228
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:31,039
think think um
 

229
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,469
think think um
think about it if both of them

230
00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:34,479
think about it if both of them
 

231
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,990
think about it if both of them
on the left you should look for the left

232
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:38,000
on the left you should look for the left
 

233
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,469
on the left you should look for the left
one including the route

234
00:05:42,469 --> 00:05:42,479

 

235
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,390

and you mentioned the left and hop on

236
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:44,400
and you mentioned the left and hop on
 

237
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,230
and you mentioned the left and hop on
the right

238
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:48,240

 

239
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,909

over the right so how about six and five

240
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:51,919
over the right so how about six and five
 

241
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,029
over the right so how about six and five
how do you find

242
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:53,039
how do you find
 

243
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,070
how do you find
whole okay so then it'll be the route

244
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:56,080
whole okay so then it'll be the route
 

245
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,469
whole okay so then it'll be the route
it'll be in the road yeah if it one is

246
00:05:58,469 --> 00:05:58,479
it'll be in the road yeah if it one is
 

247
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,230
it'll be in the road yeah if it one is
on the left one is the right it will

248
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:00,240
on the left one is the right it will
 

249
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,189
on the left one is the right it will
definitely be root where down yes and

250
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:03,199
definitely be root where down yes and
 

251
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,350
definitely be root where down yes and
how about if it's not it's all

252
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:05,360
how about if it's not it's all
 

253
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,710
how about if it's not it's all
on the same side you should

254
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:08,720
on the same side you should
 

255
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,110
on the same side you should
look on the left side yeah and if you

256
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:11,120
look on the left side yeah and if you
 

257
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,430
look on the left side yeah and if you
come find on the left side for example

258
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:13,440
come find on the left side for example
 

259
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,309
come find on the left side for example
if six and seven another note it's all

260
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:16,319
if six and seven another note it's all
 

261
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,510
if six and seven another note it's all
both on the left side

262
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:17,520
both on the left side
 

263
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,790
both on the left side
it's not on the right side yeah

264
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:20,800
it's not on the right side yeah
 

265
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,230
it's not on the right side yeah
yeah okay so so can we do

266
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:24,240
yeah okay so so can we do
 

267
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,510
yeah okay so so can we do
it can we brew first

268
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:29,520
it can we brew first
 

269
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,629
it can we brew first
what's proof

270
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:32,639

 

271
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,870

checking checking every possible note

272
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:34,880
checking checking every possible note
 

273
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,909
checking checking every possible note
yeah so we check

274
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:35,919
yeah so we check
 

275
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,189
yeah so we check
every possible note to see

276
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:39,199
every possible note to see
 

277
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,110
every possible note to see
so how many notes if there are notes we

278
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:41,120
so how many notes if there are notes we
 

279
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,550
so how many notes if there are notes we
need to check and not

280
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:42,560
need to check and not
 

281
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,590
need to check and not
and for each noun we want to check if a

282
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:45,600
and for each noun we want to check if a
 

283
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,230
and for each noun we want to check if a
note is

284
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:46,240
note is
 

285
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,870
note is
is incensed so how how can we check if

286
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:48,880
is incensed so how how can we check if
 

287
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,309
is incensed so how how can we check if
the note is

288
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:50,319
the note is
 

289
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,670
the note is
ancestor or both of two notes

290
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:53,680
ancestor or both of two notes
 

291
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,350
ancestor or both of two notes
uh if it's if

292
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:57,360
uh if it's if
 

293
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:03,350
uh if it's if
both of my children look one way

294
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:03,360

 

295
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,070

yeah so look if i i tell you six and

296
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:06,080
yeah so look if i i tell you six and
 

297
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,670
yeah so look if i i tell you six and
nine and if i want to check if

298
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:07,680
nine and if i want to check if
 

299
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,629
nine and if i want to check if
two if one is the common ancestor right

300
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:10,639
two if one is the common ancestor right
 

301
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,550
two if one is the common ancestor right
so we hope how can we do this

302
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:12,560
so we hope how can we do this
 

303
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,950
so we hope how can we do this
because each kid has only one kid one

304
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:14,960
because each kid has only one kid one
 

305
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,150
because each kid has only one kid one
one parent right

306
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:16,160
one parent right
 

307
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,550
one parent right
yeah we can go go we can find a parent

308
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:18,560
yeah we can go go we can find a parent
 

309
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,589
yeah we can go go we can find a parent
of six which is

310
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:19,599
of six which is
 

311
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,309
of six which is
two yeah we can find the parent of two

312
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:22,319
two yeah we can find the parent of two
 

313
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,350
two yeah we can find the parent of two
which is one okay

314
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:23,360
which is one okay
 

315
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,830
which is one okay
so now we have reaching the one so it

316
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:25,840
so now we have reaching the one so it
 

317
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,950
so now we have reaching the one so it
means that

318
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:26,960
means that
 

319
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,550
means that
one is the parent is is ancestor of six

320
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:30,560
one is the parent is is ancestor of six
 

321
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,909
one is the parent is is ancestor of six
and the same thing for nine if both

322
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:33,919
and the same thing for nine if both
 

323
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,589
and the same thing for nine if both
if both are if the node

324
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:37,599
if both are if the node
 

325
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,110
if both are if the node
is the both ancestor of the six and nine

326
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:41,120
is the both ancestor of the six and nine
 

327
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,150
is the both ancestor of the six and nine
and we record its level yeah

328
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:44,160
and we record its level yeah
 

329
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,950
and we record its level yeah
all right so lee look it needs the how

330
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:46,960
all right so lee look it needs the how
 

331
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,430
all right so lee look it needs the how
many

332
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:47,440
many
 

333
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,550
many
look for each note it means

334
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:50,560
look for each note it means
 

335
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,830
look for each note it means
if the note is h yeah h is the height of

336
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:53,840
if the note is h yeah h is the height of
 

337
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,189
if the note is h yeah h is the height of
the tree so it will be times

338
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:55,199
the tree so it will be times
 

339
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,629
the tree so it will be times
h and then times another edge

340
00:07:58,629 --> 00:07:58,639
h and then times another edge
 

341
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,830
h and then times another edge
all right look at it o h

342
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:01,840
all right look at it o h
 

343
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,629
all right look at it o h
n h this is the term complexity but h in

344
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:04,639
n h this is the term complexity but h in
 

345
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,950
n h this is the term complexity but h in
the worst case is what

346
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:06,960
the worst case is what
 

347
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,230
the worst case is what
when h in the worst case the height

348
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:10,240
when h in the worst case the height
 

349
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,990
when h in the worst case the height
height of the tree yeah because look for

350
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:12,000
height of the tree yeah because look for
 

351
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,469
height of the tree yeah because look for
six in each

352
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:14,479
six in each
 

353
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,309
six in each
you want to go you want to find a parent

354
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:16,319
you want to go you want to find a parent
 

355
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,070
you want to go you want to find a parent
yeah yeah

356
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:18,080
yeah yeah
 

357
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,869
yeah yeah
so it needs to one two the height yeah

358
00:08:20,869 --> 00:08:20,879
so it needs to one two the height yeah
 

359
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,390
so it needs to one two the height yeah
so the average is edge

360
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:22,400
so the average is edge
 

361
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,430
so the average is edge
so in the worst case the edge is what in

362
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:25,440
so in the worst case the edge is what in
 

363
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,110
so in the worst case the edge is what in
the worst case

364
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:27,120
the worst case
 

365
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,629
the worst case
big is the same as n right

366
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:30,639
big is the same as n right
 

367
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,709
big is the same as n right
why is that because you consider the

368
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:32,719
why is that because you consider the
 

369
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,389
why is that because you consider the
trees like that

370
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:34,399
trees like that
 

371
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,670
trees like that
i need water okay can you go whatever

372
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:37,680
i need water okay can you go whatever
 

373
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,269
i need water okay can you go whatever
okay look this is the binary tree yeah

374
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:41,279
okay look this is the binary tree yeah
 

375
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,430
okay look this is the binary tree yeah
yeah so the height is the same the

376
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:43,440
yeah so the height is the same the
 

377
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,910
yeah so the height is the same the
height is the same as the note right

378
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:45,920
height is the same as the note right
 

379
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,550
height is the same as the note right
so in the worst case this blue force

380
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:48,560
so in the worst case this blue force
 

381
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:48,949
so in the worst case this blue force
takes

382
00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:48,959
takes
 

383
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,870
takes
o and cubic time right got it

384
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:52,880
o and cubic time right got it
 

385
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,550
o and cubic time right got it
all right yeah which is kind of

386
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:56,560
all right yeah which is kind of
 

387
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,790
all right yeah which is kind of
like yeah exactly which kind of slug

388
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:58,800
like yeah exactly which kind of slug
 

389
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,790
like yeah exactly which kind of slug
because look if we want to find

390
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:00,800
because look if we want to find
 

391
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,150
because look if we want to find
these two then we need to find go to

392
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:04,160
these two then we need to find go to
 

393
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,269
these two then we need to find go to
and go through this and check checking

394
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:07,279
and go through this and check checking
 

395
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:07,590
and go through this and check checking
those

396
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:07,600
those
 

397
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,230
those
leaves and chicken chicken chickens and

398
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:10,240
leaves and chicken chicken chickens and
 

399
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,990
leaves and chicken chicken chickens and
cubic time which is slow so can we do

400
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:12,000
cubic time which is slow so can we do
 

401
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,269
cubic time which is slow so can we do
better

402
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:13,279
better
 

403
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:18,150
better
can we go better

404
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:18,160

 

405
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,190

can we do better look let's think about

406
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:21,200
can we do better look let's think about
 

407
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,389
can we do better look let's think about
just two simple three simple notes

408
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:24,399
just two simple three simple notes
 

409
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,590
just two simple three simple notes
right one two three

410
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:27,600
right one two three
 

411
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,150
right one two three
okay let's let's see one on the left one

412
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:30,160
okay let's let's see one on the left one
 

413
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,389
okay let's let's see one on the left one
on the right

414
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:32,399
on the right
 

415
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,550
on the right
yeah let's p let's kill

416
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:36,560
yeah let's p let's kill
 

417
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,750
yeah let's p let's kill
okay p and q we're given this two to

418
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:39,760
okay p and q we're given this two to
 

419
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,230
okay p and q we're given this two to
know p

420
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:40,240
know p
 

421
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,710
know p
and k we want to find find out this is

422
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:42,720
and k we want to find find out this is
 

423
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,590
and k we want to find find out this is
the load okay

424
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:43,600
the load okay
 

425
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,269
the load okay
we want to find out if it's the common

426
00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:45,279
we want to find out if it's the common
 

427
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,870
we want to find out if it's the common
sense look

428
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:48,880

 

429
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,470

if if the first of all if the p

430
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:52,480
if if the first of all if the p
 

431
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,590
if if the first of all if the p
is the load or q is the load right if

432
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:55,600
is the load or q is the load right if
 

433
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,949
is the load or q is the load right if
the loop value

434
00:09:56,949 --> 00:09:56,959
the loop value
 

435
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,070
the loop value
is the is the same as p or q then we

436
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:00,080
is the is the same as p or q then we
 

437
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,990
is the is the same as p or q then we
return the rule right because we just

438
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:02,000
return the rule right because we just
 

439
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,110
return the rule right because we just
defined if one

440
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:03,120
defined if one
 

441
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,150
defined if one
note yeah if one note

442
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:06,160
note yeah if one note
 

443
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,430
note yeah if one note
is p or q we define it as a

444
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:09,440
is p or q we define it as a
 

445
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,030
is p or q we define it as a
comma

446
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:13,040

 

447
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,350

yeah then what you can do because the

448
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:15,360
yeah then what you can do because the
 

449
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,870
yeah then what you can do because the
root

450
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:16,880
root
 

451
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,310
root
is the lowest ancestor of one of them

452
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:20,320
is the lowest ancestor of one of them
 

453
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:20,870
is the lowest ancestor of one of them
right

454
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:20,880
right
 

455
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,870
right
all right look for example if if p

456
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:24,880
all right look for example if if p
 

457
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,509
all right look for example if if p
here q here the common ancestor is b

458
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:27,519
here q here the common ancestor is b
 

459
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,230
here q here the common ancestor is b
yeah

460
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:28,240
yeah
 

461
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,150
yeah
got it yeah okay so how about if

462
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:32,160
got it yeah okay so how about if
 

463
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,550
got it yeah okay so how about if
if we fight though this is rude okay

464
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:36,560
if we fight though this is rude okay
 

465
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,110
if we fight though this is rude okay
okay so for example these are here

466
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:39,120
okay so for example these are here
 

467
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,470
okay so for example these are here
something and then if

468
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:42,480

 

469
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,829

p is here q is here okay right right

470
00:10:45,829 --> 00:10:45,839
p is here q is here okay right right
 

471
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:46,870
p is here q is here okay right right
yeah yeah

472
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:46,880
yeah yeah
 

473
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,910
yeah yeah
look so this key and q a

474
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:49,920
look so this key and q a
 

475
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,190
look so this key and q a
look p and q is on

476
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:53,200
look p and q is on
 

477
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,910
look p and q is on
roots once one side on the right yeah

478
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:55,920
roots once one side on the right yeah
 

479
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,310
roots once one side on the right yeah
yeah

480
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:58,320

 

481
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,389

on the right hand side so we can first

482
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:00,399
on the right hand side so we can first
 

483
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,430
on the right hand side so we can first
of all we can find

484
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:01,440
of all we can find
 

485
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,389
of all we can find
we can find if p and q are on the left

486
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:04,399
we can find if p and q are on the left
 

487
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:04,870
we can find if p and q are on the left
side

488
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:04,880
side
 

489
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,670
side
if on the left side we just need to take

490
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:07,680
if on the left side we just need to take
 

491
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,030
if on the left side we just need to take
the left side

492
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,040
the left side
 

493
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,630
the left side
yeah we just need to connect that if on

494
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:10,640
yeah we just need to connect that if on
 

495
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,829
yeah we just need to connect that if on
the right side just do the right side

496
00:11:12,829 --> 00:11:12,839
the right side just do the right side
 

497
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:18,740
the right side just do the right side
yeah

501
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,150

yeah okay so let's let's do this define

502
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:30,160
yeah okay so let's let's do this define
 

503
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,870
yeah okay so let's let's do this define
find ancestor

504
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:34,880

 

505
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,230

loot p q

506

loot p q
 

507
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:48,069
loot p q
right what's missing column

508
00:11:48,069 --> 00:11:48,079

 

509
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,470

because we can't find it yeah define the

510
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:50,480
because we can't find it yeah define the
 

511
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,509
because we can't find it yeah define the
base cases

512
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:51,519
base cases
 

513
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,069
base cases
the location we also need the base cases

514
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:54,079
the location we also need the base cases
 

515
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:54,629
the location we also need the base cases
right

516
00:11:54,629 --> 00:11:54,639
right
 

517
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,389
right
look you tell me if rule the value

518
00:11:58,389 --> 00:11:58,399
look you tell me if rule the value
 

519
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,629
look you tell me if rule the value
is p dot value or

520
00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:02,639
is p dot value or
 

521
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,750
is p dot value or
lu dot value is

522
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:05,760
lu dot value is
 

523
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,350
lu dot value is
q the value column return what can you

524
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:09,360
q the value column return what can you
 

525
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,069
q the value column return what can you
tell me what

526
00:12:10,069 --> 00:12:10,079
tell me what
 

527
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,030
tell me what
what's what's returning here if loot is

528
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:13,040
what's what's returning here if loot is
 

529
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,710
what's what's returning here if loot is
the one of the value will return

530
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:14,720
the one of the value will return
 

531
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,910
the one of the value will return
well which node is it if

532
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:17,920
well which node is it if
 

533
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,190
well which node is it if
big value

534
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:21,200

 

535
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,190

remember that p q thing the weight

536
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:25,200
remember that p q thing the weight
 

537
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,310
remember that p q thing the weight
yes we're done root okay now we don't

538
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:28,320
yes we're done root okay now we don't
 

539
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,269
yes we're done root okay now we don't
want to find

540
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:29,279
want to find
 

541
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,030
want to find
on the left hand side yeah so look a

542
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:33,040
on the left hand side yeah so look a
 

543
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,829
on the left hand side yeah so look a
let's do this left equals

544
00:12:36,829 --> 00:12:36,839
let's do this left equals
 

545
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,389
let's do this left equals
five ancestor

546
00:12:40,389 --> 00:12:40,399
five ancestor
 

547
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,829
five ancestor
rule the left

548
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:43,839
rule the left
 

549
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,949
rule the left
p q right we want to find it

550
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:46,959
p q right we want to find it
 

551
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,110
p q right we want to find it
we try alright we try to find on the

552
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:49,120
we try alright we try to find on the
 

553
00:12:49,120 --> 00:13:04,870
we try alright we try to find on the
left right

554
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:04,880

 

555
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,069

we yeah and then again passing with p

556
00:13:08,069 --> 00:13:08,079
we yeah and then again passing with p
 

557
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,269
we yeah and then again passing with p
and q y look if

558
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:11,279
and q y look if
 

559
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,629
and q y look if
left is num

560
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:14,639
left is num
 

561
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,030
left is num
yeah if left is now what does it mean we

562
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:17,040
yeah if left is now what does it mean we
 

563
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,269
yeah if left is now what does it mean we
just need to take the right side

564
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:19,279
just need to take the right side
 

565
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,629
just need to take the right side
we already set the right side so we

566
00:13:20,629 --> 00:13:20,639
we already set the right side so we
 

567
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,310
we already set the right side so we
return one left

568
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:22,320
return one left
 

569
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,590
return one left
his left is number one right right

570
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:25,600
his left is number one right right
 

571
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,509
his left is number one right right
right because we already find it in the

572
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:27,519
right because we already find it in the
 

573
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,670
right because we already find it in the
right and if right is down

574
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:29,680
right and if right is down
 

575
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:46,550
right and if right is down
what do you think what left yeah

576
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:46,560

 

577
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,110

on fire yeah what's that term complexity

578
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:51,120
on fire yeah what's that term complexity
 

579
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:51,630
on fire yeah what's that term complexity
um

580
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:51,640

the number of the notes in final

588
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:00,800
the number of the notes in final
 

589
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,430
the number of the notes in final
research

590
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:01,440
research
 

591
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,150
research
about energy yeah yeah yeah so okay

592
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:04,160
about energy yeah yeah yeah so okay
 

593
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,910
about energy yeah yeah yeah so okay
let's come back to the discussion

594
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:05,920
let's come back to the discussion
 

595
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,269
let's come back to the discussion
all right all right coming back to this

596
00:14:07,269 --> 00:14:07,279
all right all right coming back to this
 

597
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,910
all right all right coming back to this
question we want to find out the common

598
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:09,920
question we want to find out the common
 

599
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,790
question we want to find out the common
ancestor

daddies one is 2d one is sweetie

604
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:16,079
daddies one is 2d one is sweetie
 

605
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,470
daddies one is 2d one is sweetie
sorry about it there's two daddies one

606
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:18,480
sorry about it there's two daddies one
 

607
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,629
sorry about it there's two daddies one
is 2d and one is 3d

608
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:20,639
is 2d and one is 3d
 

609
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,670
is 2d and one is 3d
why one there which is 2d and one ah

610
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:23,680
why one there which is 2d and one ah
 

611
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,350
why one there which is 2d and one ah
okay i got it yeah well

612
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:25,360
okay i got it yeah well
 

613
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,310
okay i got it yeah well
very clever if you know it's now yeah

614
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:28,320
very clever if you know it's now yeah
 

615
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,990
very clever if you know it's now yeah
now we can't find it we return now yeah

616
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,000
now we can't find it we return now yeah
 

617
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,110
now we can't find it we return now yeah
because there's no

618
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:31,120
because there's no
 

619
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,829
because there's no
consideration if load of value is one of

620
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:33,839
consideration if load of value is one of
 

621
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,829
consideration if load of value is one of
the if the current load value

622
00:14:35,829 --> 00:14:35,839
the if the current load value
 

623
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,389
the if the current load value
is one of the nodes so then what does it

624
00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:38,399
is one of the nodes so then what does it
 

625
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,990
is one of the nodes so then what does it
mean it means that current load

626
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:40,000
mean it means that current load
 

627
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,230
mean it means that current load
is the lowest common ancestor right

628
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:44,240
is the lowest common ancestor right
 

629
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,949
is the lowest common ancestor right
otherwise eric we find it on the left

630
00:14:46,949 --> 00:14:46,959
otherwise eric we find it on the left
 

631
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,710
otherwise eric we find it on the left
and we find it on the right if we can't

632
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:48,720
and we find it on the right if we can't
 

633
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,670
and we find it on the right if we can't
find it on the left

634
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:49,680
find it on the left
 

635
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,430
find it on the left
it must be on the right if we can't find

636
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:51,440
it must be on the right if we can't find
 

637
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,310
it must be on the right if we can't find
it on the right it must be on the left

638
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:54,320
it on the right it must be on the left
 

639
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,310
it on the right it must be on the left
and what's the third cases what's the

640
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:56,320
and what's the third cases what's the
 

641
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,550
and what's the third cases what's the
last cases

642
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:58,560
last cases
 

643
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,269
last cases
what's the last cases it's only separate

644
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:01,279
what's the last cases it's only separate
 

645
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,790
what's the last cases it's only separate
yeah

646
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:02,800
yeah
 

647
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,470
yeah
it's only different branch so what does

648
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:04,480
it's only different branch so what does
 

649
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,150
it's only different branch so what does
it mean it means that sweet

650
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:06,160
it mean it means that sweet
 

651
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,550
it mean it means that sweet
yeah loot is the lowest common ancestor

652
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:08,560
yeah loot is the lowest common ancestor
 

653
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,430
yeah loot is the lowest common ancestor
okay

654
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:09,440
okay
 

655
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,990
okay
got it okay so that's it for today

656
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:12,000
got it okay so that's it for today
 

657
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,750
got it okay so that's it for today
that's it for today good job today you

658
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:13,760

want to
say bye bye to people yeah and then go
