good okay today is friday yeah okay okay
so today we talk about

6
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:08,240
so today we talk about
 

7
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,669
so today we talk about
uh finding two strings

8
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:11,679
uh finding two strings
 

9
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:13,990
uh finding two strings
special strings in a list of strings

10
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:14,000
special strings in a list of strings
 

11
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,950
special strings in a list of strings
like

12
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:14,960
like
 

13
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:30,230
like
i'm

14
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:30,240

 

15
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,510

okay so you mean i give you a list of

16
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:33,520
okay so you mean i give you a list of
 

17
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,709
okay so you mean i give you a list of
strings which has the same size you have

18
00:00:36,709 --> 00:00:36,719
strings which has the same size you have
 

19
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,310
strings which has the same size you have
four same size yes no no it could be

20
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:40,320
four same size yes no no it could be
 

21
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,229
four same size yes no no it could be
five or six but they are all the same

22
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:42,239
five or six but they are all the same
 

23
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,350
five or six but they are all the same
size right

24
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:43,360
size right
 

25
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,910
size right
okay they all have four letters oh five

26
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:45,920
okay they all have four letters oh five
 

27
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,069
okay they all have four letters oh five
letters or whatever okay

28
00:00:48,069 --> 00:00:48,079
letters or whatever okay
 

29
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,709
letters or whatever okay
so i want to tell me that if there are

30
00:00:50,709 --> 00:00:50,719
so i want to tell me that if there are
 

31
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,389
so i want to tell me that if there are
two strings in the list that

32
00:00:52,389 --> 00:00:52,399
two strings in the list that
 

33
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,709
two strings in the list that
only has one letter difference for

34
00:00:54,709 --> 00:00:54,719
only has one letter difference for
 

35
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:55,590
only has one letter difference for
example a b

36
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:55,600
example a b
 

37
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,790
example a b
c d and a b c c has only one letter

38
00:00:58,790 --> 00:00:58,800
c d and a b c c has only one letter
 

39
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,990
c d and a b c c has only one letter
difference

40
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:00,000
difference
 

41
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,710
difference
yeah so you need to tell me it's true

42
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:04,720
yeah so you need to tell me it's true
 

43
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,750
yeah so you need to tell me it's true
okay if i if i if this becomes b b

44
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:07,760
okay if i if i if this becomes b b
 

45
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,590
okay if i if i if this becomes b b
c c then you need to tell me fourth

46
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:09,600
c c then you need to tell me fourth
 

47
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,350
c c then you need to tell me fourth
because because you can't find

48
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:11,360
because because you can't find
 

49
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,550
because because you can't find
any string two strings in the in the

50
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:14,560
any string two strings in the in the
 

51
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:14,950
any string two strings in the in the
list

52
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:14,960
list
 

53
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,550
list
which only differ by one letter

54
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:18,560
which only differ by one letter
 

55
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,190
which only differ by one letter
one index okay doesn't make sense

56
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:23,200
one index okay doesn't make sense
 

57
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,230
one index okay doesn't make sense
or how can we do this oh

58
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:26,240
or how can we do this oh
 

59
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,390
or how can we do this oh
how can we do this the first thing to

60
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:28,400
how can we do this the first thing to
 

61
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,069
how can we do this the first thing to
think about

62
00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:30,079
think about
 

63
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,870
think about
how do we perform checking every

64
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:32,880
how do we perform checking every
 

65
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,789
how do we perform checking every
possibility

66
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:34,799
possibility
 

67
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,590
possibility
checking every possibility how can you

68
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:37,600
checking every possibility how can you
 

69
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:37,830
checking every possibility how can you
be

70
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:37,840
be
 

71
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,910
be
specific how to check the possibilities

72
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:41,920
specific how to check the possibilities
 

73
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,190
specific how to check the possibilities
how do we check we want to find out if

74
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:45,200
how do we check we want to find out if
 

75
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,030
how do we check we want to find out if
there are two strings so how do we find

76
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:47,040
there are two strings so how do we find
 

77
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,310
there are two strings so how do we find
out if there are two strings

78
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:48,320
out if there are two strings
 

79
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,510
out if there are two strings
what oh we can we check and

80
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:51,520
what oh we can we check and
 

81
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,910
what oh we can we check and
we check every two strings yeah and if

82
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:53,920
we check every two strings yeah and if
 

83
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,030
we check every two strings yeah and if
there are any strings

84
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:55,040
there are any strings
 

85
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,950
there are any strings
these take the blue forcing of end

86
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:56,960
these take the blue forcing of end
 

87
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,030
these take the blue forcing of end
string checking every two pairs takes

88
00:01:59,030 --> 00:01:59,040
string checking every two pairs takes
 

89
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,709
string checking every two pairs takes
how much time to pull for these pairs

90
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:02,719
how much time to pull for these pairs
 

91
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,069
how much time to pull for these pairs
what are those

92
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:06,079

 

93
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,469

oh and what the complexity of proof was

94
00:02:08,469 --> 00:02:08,479
oh and what the complexity of proof was
 

95
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,710
oh and what the complexity of proof was
in the um

96
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:10,720
in the um
 

97
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,110
in the um
square yeah well n square that's my

98
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,120
square yeah well n square that's my
 

99
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,229
square yeah well n square that's my
favorite now

100
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:14,239
favorite now
 

101
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,309
favorite now
okay and then why do you have a space

102
00:02:16,309 --> 00:02:16,319
okay and then why do you have a space
 

103
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,670
okay and then why do you have a space
using not yet

104
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:17,680
using not yet
 

105
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,309
using not yet
so we have we know o and square two blue

106
00:02:20,309 --> 00:02:20,319
so we have we know o and square two blue
 

107
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:20,869
so we have we know o and square two blue
fours in

108
00:02:20,869 --> 00:02:20,879
fours in
 

109
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,030
fours in
each player two pairs if they are in

110
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,040
each player two pairs if they are in
 

111
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,990
each player two pairs if they are in
string right

112
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:24,000
string right
 

113
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,790
string right
so how do you and square how do you

114
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:26,800
so how do you and square how do you
 

115
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,190
so how do you and square how do you
check

116
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:27,200
check
 

117
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,510
check
if there are two given two string if

118
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:29,520
if there are two given two string if
 

119
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,630
if there are two given two string if
their own they differ by one characters

120
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:32,640
their own they differ by one characters
 

121
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,150
their own they differ by one characters
oh you just go like this

122
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:36,160
oh you just go like this
 

123
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,869
oh you just go like this
go through here if it's different then

124
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:38,879
go through here if it's different then
 

125
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,150
go through here if it's different then
you'll return right

126
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:40,160
you'll return right
 

127
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,910
you'll return right
now if they're different you can't you

128
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:41,920
now if they're different you can't you
 

129
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,589
now if they're different you can't you
add one yeah and answer

130
00:02:43,589 --> 00:02:43,599
add one yeah and answer
 

131
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,110
add one yeah and answer
the one and then you keep going right

132
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:45,120
the one and then you keep going right
 

133
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,670
the one and then you keep going right
they need a maximum it's one

134
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:47,680
they need a maximum it's one
 

135
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,229
they need a maximum it's one
it's not maximum the minimum the maximum

136
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:50,239
it's not maximum the minimum the maximum
 

137
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:50,790
it's not maximum the minimum the maximum
one

138
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:50,800
one
 

139
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,509
one
so it has to be exactly one difference

140
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:53,519
so it has to be exactly one difference
 

141
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:54,150
so it has to be exactly one difference
right

142
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:54,160
right
 

143
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,390
right
so you actually count the difference by

144
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:56,400
so you actually count the difference by
 

145
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,350
so you actually count the difference by
going through like

146
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:57,360
going through like
 

147
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,790
going through like
wait what if two are the same

148
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:00,800
wait what if two are the same
 

149
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,790
wait what if two are the same
then it's zero the difference is zero

150
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:02,800
then it's zero the difference is zero
 

151
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,990
then it's zero the difference is zero
and it's not the same

152
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:04,000
and it's not the same
 

153
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,509
and it's not the same
so correct so yeah first so basically we

154
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:07,519
so correct so yeah first so basically we
 

155
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,190
so correct so yeah first so basically we
want to

156
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:09,200
want to
 

157
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,750
want to
iterate each character compare character

158
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:11,760
iterate each character compare character
 

159
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,030
iterate each character compare character
by character

160
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,040
by character
 

161
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,110
by character
and increment the counter if they are

162
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:15,120
and increment the counter if they are
 

163
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,550
and increment the counter if they are
different right

164
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:16,560
different right
 

165
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,509
different right
yeah and then as i said if they are the

166
00:03:19,509 --> 00:03:19,519
yeah and then as i said if they are the
 

167
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,750
yeah and then as i said if they are the
length of the each word is air

168
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:21,760
length of the each word is air
 

169
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,229
length of the each word is air
then it needs to take over a time right

170
00:03:24,229 --> 00:03:24,239
then it needs to take over a time right
 

171
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,190
then it needs to take over a time right
yeah

172
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:25,200
yeah
 

173
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,670
yeah
doesn't make sense given to a string so

174
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:27,680
doesn't make sense given to a string so
 

175
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,589
doesn't make sense given to a string so
the overall complexity for these

176
00:03:29,589 --> 00:03:29,599
the overall complexity for these
 

177
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:34,149
the overall complexity for these
is o n square times l does it make sense

178
00:03:34,149 --> 00:03:34,159
is o n square times l does it make sense
 

179
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,270
is o n square times l does it make sense
yeah does it make sense yeah eh

180
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:37,280
yeah does it make sense yeah eh
 

181
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,670
yeah does it make sense yeah eh
is it clear quite slow yeah question

182
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:39,680
is it clear quite slow yeah question
 

183
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,550
is it clear quite slow yeah question
because but

184
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:40,560
because but
 

185
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,309
because but
at the beginning let me repeat at the

186
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:42,319
at the beginning let me repeat at the
 

187
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,149
at the beginning let me repeat at the
beginning we need to proof what's in

188
00:03:44,149 --> 00:03:44,159
beginning we need to proof what's in
 

189
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,110
beginning we need to proof what's in
each pair

190
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:45,120
each pair
 

191
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,910
each pair
that will be on square and for each pair

192
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:47,920
that will be on square and for each pair
 

193
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,110
that will be on square and for each pair
we need to take

194
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:49,120
we need to take
 

195
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,550
we need to take
our time to check each character

196
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:52,560
our time to check each character
 

197
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,869
our time to check each character
yeah to check if character to find out

198
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:54,879
yeah to check if character to find out
 

199
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,070
yeah to check if character to find out
if they're only

200
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:56,080
if they're only
 

201
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,470
if they're only
one difference right let's overall

202
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:58,480
one difference right let's overall

okay and you can say look mommy is mommy
in a they will return fourth right

264
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,000
in a they will return fourth right
 

265
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,350
in a they will return fourth right
because it's not in the mouth

266
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:37,360
because it's not in the mouth
 

267
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,070
because it's not in the mouth
you know in a hash set you can say eric

268
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,080
you know in a hash set you can say eric
 

269
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,270
you know in a hash set you can say eric
in

270
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:41,280
in
 

271
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,590
in
a then return to right because we just

272
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:43,600
a then return to right because we just
 

273
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,790
a then return to right because we just
added

274
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:44,800
added
 

275
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,029
added
yeah yeah so that's all one constant

276
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:47,039
yeah yeah so that's all one constant
 

277
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,550
yeah yeah so that's all one constant
look up time right

278
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:48,560
look up time right
 

279
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,310
look up time right
you have no book you just look it

280
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:50,320
you have no book you just look it
 

281
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,230
you have no book you just look it
instantly you can find if there are eric

282
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:52,240
instantly you can find if there are eric
 

283
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,270
instantly you can find if there are eric
or ryan on a

284
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:53,280
or ryan on a
 

285
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,550
or ryan on a
notebook doesn't make sense yeah i said

286
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:56,560
notebook doesn't make sense yeah i said
 

287
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,710
notebook doesn't make sense yeah i said
do you understand yeah

288
00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:58,720
do you understand yeah
 

289
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,430
do you understand yeah
what's this key value pair then you'll

290
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:01,440
what's this key value pair then you'll
 

291
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,110
what's this key value pair then you'll
be like

292
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:03,120
be like
 

293
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,340
be like
wait i'm underground with

294

297
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,469

you can say look a

298
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:20,479
you can say look a
 

299
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,830
you can say look a
a week equals a

300
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:23,840
a week equals a
 

301
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,670
a week equals a
and a e right look it has key this is

302
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:27,680
and a e right look it has key this is
 

303
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,070
and a e right look it has key this is
key

304
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,080
key
 

305
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,950
key
and that's the value seven and i can say

306
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:30,960
and that's the value seven and i can say
 

307
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,430
and that's the value seven and i can say
i can

308
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:31,440
i can
 

309
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,070
i can
i can look at this value a area where

310
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:34,080
i can look at this value a area where
 

311
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,189
i can look at this value a area where
you could return a

312
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:35,199
you could return a
 

313
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,790
you could return a
a writing will determine seven it

314
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:36,800
a writing will determine seven it
 

315
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,469
a writing will determine seven it
doesn't make sense so this is

316
00:06:38,469 --> 00:06:38,479
doesn't make sense so this is
 

317
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,950
doesn't make sense so this is
a one constant it has key value pair but

318
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:40,960
a one constant it has key value pair but
 

319
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,469
a one constant it has key value pair but
this one is only have key it doesn't

320
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:42,479
this one is only have key it doesn't
 

321
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,150
this one is only have key it doesn't
have value it's a collection

322
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:44,160
have value it's a collection
 

323
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,830
have value it's a collection
collection it doesn't have all the it

that's that's all called notebook yeah

328
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:50,000
that's that's all called notebook yeah
 

329
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,950
that's that's all called notebook yeah
because you can

330
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:50,960
because you can
 

331
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,110
because you can
you can have a key value pair on your

332
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:53,120
you can have a key value pair on your
 

333
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,870
you can have a key value pair on your
notebook or you can just write the name

because we
if we find police in a notebook abcd we

358
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:22,479
if we find police in a notebook abcd we
 

359
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:23,430
if we find police in a notebook abcd we
can only check

360
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:23,440
can only check
 

361
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,749
can only check
if there are same string abcd in the

362
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:25,759
if there are same string abcd in the
 

363
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:26,629
if there are same string abcd in the
notebook right

364
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:26,639
notebook right
 

365
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,070
notebook right
but we want to find out if there are

366
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,080
but we want to find out if there are
 

367
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,629
but we want to find out if there are
string which differs by this by only one

368
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:30,639
string which differs by this by only one
 

369
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,790
string which differs by this by only one
difference so what does it mean

370
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:32,800
difference so what does it mean
 

371
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,350
difference so what does it mean
so can i how can we solve this problem

372
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:35,360
so can i how can we solve this problem
 

373
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,830
so can i how can we solve this problem
abcd how many variants different by one

374
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:37,840
abcd how many variants different by one
 

375
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,070
abcd how many variants different by one
character

376
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,080

what how many how many variants how many
 

379
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:43,589
what how many how many variants how many
possibilities

380
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:43,599
possibilities
 

381
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,629
possibilities
it differ by one character what what are

382
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:46,639
it differ by one character what what are
 

383
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,430
it differ by one character what what are
those

384
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:47,440
those
 

385
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,350
those
a b c d no what are the characters

386
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:51,360
a b c d no what are the characters
 

387
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,950
a b c d no what are the characters
can you leave the example which is

388
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:52,960
can you leave the example which is
 

389
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,469
can you leave the example which is
different than this one

390
00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:54,479
different than this one
 

391
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,550
different than this one
okay so there can be multiple letters

392
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:58,560
okay so there can be multiple letters
 

393
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,029
okay so there can be multiple letters
of changing no no just one letter

394
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:01,039
of changing no no just one letter
 

395
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:01,589
of changing no no just one letter
difference

396
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:01,599
difference
 

397
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,350
difference
what are they one different thing can

398
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:03,360
what are they one different thing can
 

399
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,950
what are they one different thing can
you give me an example which is one

400
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:04,960
you give me an example which is one
 

401
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,670
you give me an example which is one
different

402
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:05,680
different
 

403
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,629
different
one letter difference b b c v well done

404
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:08,639
one letter difference b b c v well done
 

405
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,110
one letter difference b b c v well done
so

406
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:09,120
so
 

407
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,670
so
the first one is not it it's not it's

408
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:11,680
the first one is not it it's not it's
 

409
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,710
the first one is not it it's not it's
different right

410
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:12,720
different right
 

411
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,589
different right
yeah so basically you'll be b c d

412
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:15,599
yeah so basically you'll be b c d
 

413
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:16,390
yeah so basically you'll be b c d
something

414
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:16,400
something
 

415
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,589
something
b c d right or a something c d

416
00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:19,599
b c d right or a something c d
 

417
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,790
b c d right or a something c d
right or a b something d right

418
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:22,800
right or a b something d right

a question mark cd

474
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:33,839
a question mark cd
 

475
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,670
a question mark cd
a b question mark d and a b

476
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:37,680
a b question mark d and a b
 

477
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,269
a b question mark d and a b
or a b c question and then you hop on

478
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:41,279
or a b c question and then you hop on
 

479
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,310
or a b c question and then you hop on
the next one

480
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:42,320
the next one
 

481
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,910
the next one
and this a b c c and that's

482
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:45,920
and this a b c c and that's
 

483
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,110
and this a b c c and that's
also match up with a b c crack your mark

484
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:49,120
also match up with a b c crack your mark
 

485
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,870
also match up with a b c crack your mark
okay so because we already put these

486
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:50,880
okay so because we already put these
 

487
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,110
okay so because we already put these
four variants in a notebook right

488
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:53,120
four variants in a notebook right
 

489
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,670
four variants in a notebook right
yeah and then we can look it up right

490
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:55,680
yeah and then we can look it up right
 

491
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,790
yeah and then we can look it up right
and you find it

492
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:56,800
and you find it
 

493
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,150
and you find it
we we follow one match right doesn't

494
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:00,160
we we follow one match right doesn't
 

495
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,110
we we follow one match right doesn't
make sense

496
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:01,120
make sense
 

497
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,030
make sense
yeah otherwise you'll put it there so

498
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,040
yeah otherwise you'll put it there so
 

499
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:09,269
yeah otherwise you'll put it there so
let that work okay let us do this

500
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:09,279

 

501
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,310

define uh let's just check

502
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:12,320
define uh let's just check
 

503
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:19,030
define uh let's just check
and we have these words okay and then

504
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:19,040

 

505
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,069

okay so now we have this data data which

506
00:10:22,069 --> 00:10:22,079
okay so now we have this data data which
 

507
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,310
okay so now we have this data data which
is the set yeah we just need to store

508
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:24,320
is the set yeah we just need to store
 

509
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,829
is the set yeah we just need to store
these variants you have to remember the

510
00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:25,839
these variants you have to remember the
 

511
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:26,949
these variants you have to remember the
variance

512
00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:26,959
variance
 

513
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,310
variance
okay look for words

514
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:30,320
okay look for words
 

515
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,310
okay look for words
in yeah so these words will be

516
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:34,320
in yeah so these words will be
 

517
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,470
in yeah so these words will be
what would be abc something like that

518
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:36,480
what would be abc something like that
 

519
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,310
what would be abc something like that
this is the word w yeah

520
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:38,320
this is the word w yeah
 

521
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,590
this is the word w yeah
w will be okay so now we want to solve

522
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:41,600
w will be okay so now we want to solve
 

523
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,630
w will be okay so now we want to solve
the variance

524
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:42,640
the variance
 

525
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,389
the variance
we want to get the valence how do we get

526
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:44,399
we want to get the valence how do we get
 

527
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,630
we want to get the valence how do we get
the variance replace it with question

528
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:46,640
the variance replace it with question
 

529
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,870
the variance replace it with question
mark

530
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:48,880
mark
 

531
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,030
mark
every character yeah look how do we do

532
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,040
every character yeah look how do we do
 

533
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,389
every character yeah look how do we do
this for i

534
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:52,399
this for i
 

535
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,509
this for i
in range

536
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:55,519
in range
 

537
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,710
in range
length w

538
00:10:58,710 --> 00:10:58,720
length w
 

539
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,870
length w
yeah so we index it and then we want to

540
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:00,880
yeah so we index it and then we want to
 

541
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,630
yeah so we index it and then we want to
look at the currently i will be

542
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:02,640
look at the currently i will be
 

543
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,550
look at the currently i will be
index for this one so we want to replace

544
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:04,560
index for this one so we want to replace
 

545
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,750
index for this one so we want to replace
this one

546
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:05,760
this one
 

547
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,710
this one
yeah so look the variance let's do it

548
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:08,720
yeah so look the variance let's do it
 

549
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,590
yeah so look the variance let's do it
variance okay

550
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:09,600
variance okay
 

551
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,670
variance okay
v equals w

552
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:13,680
v equals w
 

553
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,949
v equals w
yeah i want to get i okay

554
00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:16,959
yeah i want to get i okay
 

555
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,230
yeah i want to get i okay
so i want to get the array i want to get

556
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:20,240
so i want to get the array i want to get
 

557
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,430
so i want to get the array i want to get
get the for example look here i is here

558
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:23,440
get the for example look here i is here
 

559
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,910
get the for example look here i is here
i want to get all the characters before

560
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:25,920
i want to get all the characters before
 

561
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,949
i want to get all the characters before
i which is

562
00:11:26,949 --> 00:11:26,959
i which is
 

563
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,990
i which is
this part yeah at least b i want to

564
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:30,000
this part yeah at least b i want to
 

565
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,910
this part yeah at least b i want to
replace it with question mark yeah

566
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:31,920
replace it with question mark yeah
 

567
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,030
replace it with question mark yeah
question mark yeah yeah and then now i

568
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:35,040
question mark yeah yeah and then now i
 

569
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,750
question mark yeah yeah and then now i
want to get

570
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:35,760
want to get
 

571
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,990
want to get
all of the characters after so what's

572
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:38,000
all of the characters after so what's
 

573
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,190
all of the characters after so what's
this

574

i plus 1 to the n yeah
 

581
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,750
i plus 1 to the n yeah
this is beginning to the i not including

582
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:51,760
this is beginning to the i not including
