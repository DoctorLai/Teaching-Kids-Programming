1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Maybe

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:10,700
what's playing on the tree hey did you

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:10,700
know that five years ago dad had

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:17,520
nothing what's financially uh it's a

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,039
tree data structure right it's a data

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:24,560
structure binary tree is a it's like

7
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:28,460
this is a graph with

8
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:31,260
maximum two it's dag yeah attack

9
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:34,020
yeah directly means that some parents

10
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:36,360
took it okay so it's a data structure

11
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,360
hey that structure is how the computer

12
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,640
how we ask computer how to store the

13
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,239
data in an organized way okay data

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,040
structure so financially what kind of

15
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:50,520
order does the web for search order is

16
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:53,100
for this particular tree one two three

17
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,860
four five six seven level by level

18
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,020
what's the data structure we need to use

19
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:01,739
to perform a buffer search

20
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:04,739
q q yes Q

21
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:04,739
foreign

22
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:17,880
Zach what's the zika so one three two

23
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:21,960
and then the next one will be four five

24
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:24,540
six seven eleven ten nine okay so what's

25
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:30,540
this that's not a zigzag it's a line

26
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:32,040
like one yeah if full had another kid it

27
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,680
would be Sports

28
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,180
seven it's yeah that's what I'm saying

29
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,720
if four had another kid it would be

30
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,720
squashed

31
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,619
is uneven

32
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:49,140
salmon is a baby

33
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:51,000
yeah yeah okay so the the key thing here

34
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,100
is that

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,840
professor she always from left to the

36
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:58,680
right right yes

37
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:02,640
so now I'm just changing the order of uh

38
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:05,040
every other level okay so one one is

39
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,160
from left to the right

40
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,440
next level is from right to the left the

41
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,420
next one is from left to the right the

42
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:17,340
next one is from right to the left okay

43
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:19,140
yes I'm going to return this you know

44
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,360
away other ways so we're going to

45
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,700
pretend this

46
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,340
okay

47
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,200
why is

48
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:29,760
[Music]

49
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,620
instead of two three that's good

50
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,920
question that's how we perform a zigzag

51
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,720
okay make it make it more interesting so

52
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,360
one from left to the right and the next

53
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,879
one right to the left next one left to

54
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,700
the right next one right to the left

55
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:48,500
so what kind of the algorithm can we use

56
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,500
to to give this a kind of order

57
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:01,440
where in the code we need to modify that

58
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,200
to make it dig them you mentioned that

59
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,480
we need to use the Q double ndq first in

60
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:10,980
first out right

61
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:13,680
before I prefer search we have a loot

62
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:16,860
the special case is that if the loot

63
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,080
given is empty if not rooted if loot is

64
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:22,140
9 we just need to return immediately

65
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,400
okay with an empty this answer equals

66
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:28,319
this

67
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:30,420
at the beginning we use the Q equals DQ

68
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:33,260
at the beginning we put a note in right

69
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,260
there's only one note

70
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,120
okay a kill at the beginning I put a one

71
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,040
in when there is Anime in the queue I

72
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,080
take it out right so but when you want

73
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:49,080
to take all the notes in the same level

74
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,940
we need to know how many nodes in the

75
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,580
same level which is this lens I can't

76
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:57,000
remember let's put it in carbon at the

77
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:59,459
beginning it's empty with these stores

78
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,959
the number of nodes in the center like

79
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:07,680
one two three four five okay so for

80
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:09,780
underscore in range and there are nodes

81
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,860
in the camera right and I need to pop it

82
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:14,099
out

83
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:15,360
so x equals Q dot we want to take this

84
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:17,419
element out

85
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,859
what's the message

86
00:04:17,419 --> 00:04:22,680
up left

87
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:24,840
if we don't specify the lab which side

88
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,000
does it take right side effect and we

89
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,639
look this side is a pen

90
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,620
okay and you've learned a pen on the

91
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:33,240
left hand side what do we call it this

92
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:37,880
is a pen

93
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,880
a pen a pen left right A pen left

94
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:45,000
and this side is top if we don't specify

95
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,220
the left it's on the right okay this is

96
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,100
double ended because we can do this push

97
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:52,800
and pop on two sides double ended kill

98
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:54,300
that pop left

99
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,139
okay

100
00:04:54,300 --> 00:05:02,040
current a pen x right then if x start

101
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:04,259
left we have a left now Q dot append

102
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:06,120
extra left and we need to do this for

103
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:08,759
the same for the right tree if there is

104
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:11,400
the right tree

105
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:13,860
Q dot upon

106
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:16,380
x dot y

107
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:19,199
and return

108
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:20,820
answer okay so now we have this current

109
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,940
right after these

110
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:27,380
no we need to push it to answer answer

111
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:27,380
the apparent carbon node

112
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,740
different answer

113
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:36,180
this is standard pressure search this is

114
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:39,240
kind of repeated right if we checking if

115
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:42,000
let node has the left note we push it

116
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:45,000
two in it has a rhino push to it right

117
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,860
so we can do a loop for Loop for Kit

118
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,240
yeah kit

119
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:52,020
in

120
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:54,960
x dot net x dot y right

121
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:57,680
and then if the kid is not known if kit

122
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:01,560
or if kit is not long then we do this Q

123
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:04,620
dot a pen okay right and that's it yes

124
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:07,020
so okay so let's emulate these

125
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,699
professors okay I put a one in right I

126
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,600
take everything in a queue how many

127
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:11,759
notes

128
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,340
now

129
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,020
one right just one right so I take it

130
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:19,680
out one here

131
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:22,500
what's the kit of one three three

132
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,259
yeah three and two so I push it two and

133
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:27,360
three you know right two and three how

134
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:30,300
many kids are in the queue now

135
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,979
two yeah which are two and three two and

136
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:35,340
three they are innocent level right so I

137
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:40,080
take it off what's the kid up too

138
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:42,060
four or five okay what's kid of three

139
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,580
okay nothing we just skip okay so

140
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:46,380
basically this is what a professor is on

141
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:48,840
the left-hand side Lisa keep the order

142
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:50,699
one two three four five so which line of

143
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:53,340
code we need to change to make it you

144
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:56,720
know zigzag coming back to the subject

145
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,720
the second the

146
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,940
last yeah so this one needs to be

147
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,039
reversed but it's not not right this

148
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,979
neither so how do we know if it's an

149
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:10,259
even land

150
00:07:06,979 --> 00:07:11,759
we check so look at this answer thing

151
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:13,860
right one

152
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,680
two three

153
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:21,000
four five right something like that so

154
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:22,919
we are adding the one two three Low by

155
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,560
row to it so we just have to check the

156
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:26,520
length of the answer right so if it's

157
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,539
the

158
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,539
if current

159
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:35,160
elements of answers

160
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:37,380
is odd number then we need to reverse

161
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,000
this right so we need to reverse these

162
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:41,580
two three all right but not left right

163
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,940
so how can we do this so we just have to

164
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:47,340
check change a bit slow right yeah the

165
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:50,400
answer not a pen current right make

166
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:52,199
sense so we just have to check if the

167
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,240
length of the answer is an odd number

168
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:56,759
right if it's an odd number then the
