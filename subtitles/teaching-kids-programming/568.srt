1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,660
hello hello Mr Mr Runner right so what's

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,480
finally says tree

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,960
is

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:15,240
and the one on the left side has to be

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:17,760
smaller than the this parent and the one

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:21,539
on the right hand needs to be bigger and

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:24,600
and they still need to be the same so

8
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:26,640
like if the one in the left if the one

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:30,660
on the bigger is still have to be

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:34,640
smaller than the the part of the one of

11
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,640
its parents is this a PSD

12
00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:51,480
that's right because this on this side

13
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,480
needs to be bigger than seven okay so

14
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,460
let's put eight right this is the final

15
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,219
search given the binary search tree we

16
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,079
want to find out the minimum difference

17
00:00:58,219 --> 00:01:03,719
minimum difference of any two notes in

18
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:06,260
the binary substrate what's the smallest

19
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:10,500
distance the difference

20
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:12,659
nine and eight okay so these two notes

21
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,299
yeah seven and eight okay so just to

22
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:17,600
return one okay return one the minimum

23
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:17,600
difference

24
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,840
okay opening two notes for example A and

25
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,840
B so we want to get the minimum

26
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,540
difference which is the absolute value A

27
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,700
and B right this is absolute value do

28
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:33,119
you still remember this okay X

29
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:37,320
mathematics equals x if x bigger than

30
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:39,900
zero zero if x equals zero minus x if x

31
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,700
is right this is absolute value this is

32
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,640
minor one the distance to the number

33
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,200
zero this is one right for any positive

34
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,200
number the distance

35
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,899
to the zero is Excel for the negative

36
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,299
number the distance is negative X okay

37
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:58,740
so this one for

38
00:01:54,299 --> 00:02:00,720
A and B belongs to all the nodes in the

39
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,880
VST okay

40
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:05,399
any idea how we're doing this remember

41
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,860
we are even a binary surgery what can we

42
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:11,640
do about the binary search tree why are

43
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:14,760
we giving the minus 3.

44
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,500
finally search three is already sorted

45
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,200
but we need just need to perform what

46
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:22,020
kind of order to make it assertive in

47
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,720
order yes well what's in order you know

48
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:28,040
there is a type of water yes so you know

49
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:31,500
there is an order for a level

50
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:34,500
is it in order that makes the one

51
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:37,379
research free in order okay so this is

52
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:39,840
no left three yeah another Library so

53
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:41,760
the order will be the last three will be

54
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,739
to the left three first and the node and

55
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,720
the right shoe right because this this

56
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:48,300
is seven right we want to visit the

57
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:50,400
nodes that are smaller than seven

58
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:53,420
right and then we visited now server and

59
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,420
we visited the notifications

60
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:59,160
doing this in order I think on the left

61
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,860
tree and right three recursively and

62
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,700
then that gives us a salty list make

63
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,519
sense

64
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:07,800
so we can perform that in order then we

65
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,599
get the salty list so what do we do with

66
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,340
the sausages so after this that will be

67
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:16,739
minus my

68
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:18,900
and minus five one seven eight nine a

69
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:21,080
hundred so okay so we have this 30 days

70
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:24,000
what do we do with it

71
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:26,879
we get me to the line with first two

72
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,040
numbers and just yeah compare can you

73
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,420
prove to me can you explain to me why we

74
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,640
just need to check these two numbers

75
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:36,300
enabling two numbers or you know not any

76
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:38,760
other numbers because it is in order so

77
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:40,500
it's it's like if humanity is obviously

78
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,659
gonna be even different it's gonna be

79
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,040
greater than these two yes because they

80
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:46,319
solve it right because it's a very good

81
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,000
explanation the minimum we are looking

82
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,580
for a minimum difference it has to be

83
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,560
the neighbor to numbers in a substitute

84
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:56,940
so we can just do this right do this do

85
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,680
this and then we get a minute okay so by

86
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,599
converting to a list right we can use

87
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,519
the you know we can convert into a list

88
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:04,440
or we can use the generator here the

89
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:07,620
thing right prefer search

90
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:10,260
prefer search in order right loot

91
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:13,500
is not loot

92
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:15,420
if we have empty nodes you know we've

93
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,579
reached the end I'll just return

94
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:19,560
we visit the left part first right so

95
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:22,079
years from

96
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:25,440
yet from yeah from default search

97
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:28,740
recursion X such low down left let's

98
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:31,800
visit the left tree recursively and then

99
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:34,860
get whatever nose there yeah the year

100
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:37,620
from that and then now it is time to

101
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:40,740
visit the calendar right so yeah if we

102
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:43,560
only eat a single the year load of value

103
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:45,300
and can you guess what's next

104
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,100
when you visit the left tree you visit

105
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,460
the current now and what should we do

106
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:52,020
now we did the right tree so yeah

107
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:56,340
from

108
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:58,080
that massage was sex right lose don't

109
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:01,380
write okay

110
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,540
numbers equals this is a return Purpose

111
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,320
with the year so we need to convert it

112
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:07,080
to

113
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:09,120
we need to convert it to least year

114
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,280
defensive shoes so basically at least

115
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,080
you would you know travel through using

116
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,259
it in order and after that we can just

117
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:18,680
do this for you know answer at the

118
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:22,259
beginning is infinity right Infinity for

119
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:24,000
I in range

120
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:25,380
lens

121
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,060
numbers

122
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:32,460
minus one and answer equals minimum we

123
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:35,220
also get a minimum answer

124
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:39,539
absolute value

125
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:40,919
numbers I minus numbers I plus one right

126
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:43,699
the neighboring

127
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:43,699
written answer

128
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:48,180
okay so if the root is

129
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:49,620
F if it were given an empty tree then we

130
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,060
will return Infinity if we want to

131
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,280
return zero then we have to check here

132
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,740
we can answer if answer

133
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,539
not equal Infinity otherwise still okay

134
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:01,160
we're looking for the minimum so we can

135
00:05:57,539 --> 00:06:04,320
say return mean

136
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:07,860
absolute numbers I minus num I plus one

137
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:11,280
for I in range length Lambs I minus one

138
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:13,800
54 equals zero if it's a robust is empty

139
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,320
so the function return mean this

140
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,860
iterable yeah

141
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:23,340
before

142
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:26,039
so when the eat when it is empty before

143
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:28,080
it's zero otherwise will return the

144
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:31,020
minimum of the all the elements in the

145
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:34,199
in the either of us this is using the

146
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:37,680
year right so we still when we go into

147
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:40,139
the other notes in the tree we still

148
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,600
have to use the additional space which

149
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:44,160
is o n the tantumplex diesel and N is

150
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:48,060
the number of nodes in a balances tree

151
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,860
the space complexity is o h h in the

152
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:53,220
worst case is n

153
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:55,680
n minus 1 actually so it's n right so H

154
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:57,900
the height of the tree

155
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,539
because what space complexity for uh

156
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:03,660
recursion it's according depth right in

157
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:05,840
what cases H is n minus one it's like a

158
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,840
line

159
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:27,900
numbers and then we can do this number

160
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:30,660
extend all the thing yeah all the things

161
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:32,880
from devices to the left and numbers

162
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:35,220
append this value and numbers don't

163
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:38,280
extend all the numbers from like it's

164
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:40,080
not as elegant as this approach using a

165
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:43,080
year do we need to store all the numbers

166
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,580
in that array we don't right we just

167
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,979
need to you know get these two numbers

168
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:49,020
right we don't need to keep tracking all

169
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:50,759
the numbers in our way how do we find

170
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,319
out the distance this is one is the

171
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:54,660
minimum

172
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,699
do we need to get all the numbers and

173
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:59,340
put it down on the list we don't like we

174
00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:01,860
just need to know the previous previous

175
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:03,960
one remember the previous one okay seven

176
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:05,160
what's the previous six six go to the

177
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,259
previous three

178
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:10,919
okay six months I went to the previous

179
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:14,280
six hey what's the previous seven a

180
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:15,900
hundred what's the previous nine okay as

181
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,180
long as I know the previous I can get

182
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:20,099
the distance I have this previous and

183
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:22,220
the beginning is now right at the

184
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:22,220
beginning

185
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:32,099
we need to go to the left tree first

186
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:34,440
left versus do the left

187
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:36,360
okay and then now I have to check if the

188
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,740
previous if there's a previous right

189
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,479
obviously at the beginning there's no

190
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,279
previous even the previous then I can

191
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:43,020
say answer right answer at the beginning

192
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,899
Infinity

193
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:47,580
answer by the way in order to assess

194
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:50,220
these two value you have to add the

195
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:53,220
global or longer okay depending on the

196
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:58,040
context answer if answer equals the

197
00:08:53,220 --> 00:09:02,339
minimum answer absolute value previous

198
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:04,080
Top Value minus noodle value right if

199
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:06,660
laser is the previous value

200
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,959
I get a distance I can compute the

201
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:11,940
distance and I save the minimum before

202
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:13,920
going to the right right before going to

203
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,760
the right which no I should set to the

204
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,640
previous

205
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,480
okay now I'm here right look I'm at null

206
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,720
seven

207
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,700
okay and I'm going to travel these three

208
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,399
to the right tree which one is the

209
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:28,800
previous value seven yeah so I'm here

210
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:32,540
right I'm about to travel this slide

211
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,540
three so that to the left

212
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:37,260
is it seven

213
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:39,300
yeah seven I'm about to travel the right

214
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,860
tree and then I'm in the dude I'm

215
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,899
traveling the right tree so I need to

216
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:45,240
set the value here the previous value

217
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:46,920
this is the previous value of whatever

218
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,660
the right show you right if it's a

219
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,459
single node so I'm about to travel to

220
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:53,459
nine what's the previous value of nine

221
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:55,260
seven yeah then it makes sense okay I'm

222
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:57,600
about to travel these three what's the

223
00:09:55,260 --> 00:10:00,000
previous value of these seven seven

224
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,420
right because look eight okay so now I

225
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,420
just have to say previous equals loot

226
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:06,420
foreign

227
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:15,200
dude

228
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,200
what's the news about right

229
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,240
and after least I definitely search root

230
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:23,700
and I already know the mean answer here

231
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:26,760
they can answer

232
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:31,700
okay what is an answer

233
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:31,700
so again yeah we have to visit all the

234
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:37,800
not the minimum difference of any two

235
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:41,100
notes in a given binary search tree am I

236
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:43,740
right so what's any tool

237
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:46,800
right you have to travel

238
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:49,260
all the notes to find out the minimum am

239
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,360
I right does it make sense so that means

240
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:53,519
that the time connects is o n but for

241
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,820
this one the space complexity we don't

242
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,560
need to store the addition uh the

243
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,420
numbers in the additional way right

244
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,760
there is no array here right there's no

245
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:05,399
here let's do nothing but for this one

246
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:08,279
the space complexity

247
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:10,140
this is still oh because it's using

248
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:11,940
recursion right you can't really say

249
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:14,100
there's no nothing because there is

250
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:17,279
something there before you said then no

251
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:19,500
no think there is something there okay

252
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,720
so even a note is nothing we have to

253
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:24,000
define the base cases if no if we're

254
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,800
reaching a hundred I know what's next

255
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,220
what is left nothing what is right

256
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,720
nothing right this is the nothing like

257
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,940
for each node

258
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,620
the binary tree for each you know there

259
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,240
are two pointers to the left three and

260
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:38,399
right three and if it's like this no

261
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,320
this is nothing this is nothing okay

262
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:45,000
it's nothing but you said they know

263
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:47,880
nothing so damages okay not nothing

264
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,880
it's not Standard English

265
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:53,519
okay so how can I say it perfectly

266
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,680
there's no left part of it there's no

267
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,360
right part okay that's it the left tree

268
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,880
and the right tree is empty it's a leaf

269
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,800
now right even you know right right this

270
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,459
nose these are these notes okay what

271
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,459
have you learned today

272
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:14,399
the minimum difference between

273
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:16,860
between number in the list in the binary

274
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:19,260
surgery right yeah and you use a list

275
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:20,760
yeah sometimes one question why are we

276
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:24,180
giving a binary substitute what

277
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:26,760
advantage of it is basically is in order

278
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:28,980
and that's o-n right if we are not

279
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:31,260
giving up another Street then we sort it

280
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:34,079
what's the time complexity oh and Logan

281
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:36,240
right so look and numbers in the final

282
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:38,279
three yeah we use the O and performance

283
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,800
in order like give us a salted wrist

284
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:43,740
right this is Owen but if this is not by

285
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,720
necessary we put it in a list we need to

286
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:48,000
sort it that's our login right that's

287
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:50,639
the thing because this is the binary

288
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,279
search tree that's why performing a o n

289
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:55,980
gives us a 30 piece if it's not a fine

290
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:59,040
necessary we sort it that would require

291
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:00,899
over login right doesn't make sense okay

292
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,380
so which method is better this one

293
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:03,380
another one

294
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:17,579
yeah because we don't have to put all

295
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:20,339
the numbers on the list that's a great

296
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:22,500
advantage of using it right make sense

297
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:25,820
yeah okay that's it for today bye-bye

298
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,820
bye bye bye
