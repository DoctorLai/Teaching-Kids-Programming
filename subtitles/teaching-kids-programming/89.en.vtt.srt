go hello hello everybody hello

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:03,760
go hello hello everybody hello

00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,869
go hello hello everybody hello
ryan how are you today good morning

4
00:00:06,869 --> 00:00:06,879
ryan how are you today good morning
 

5
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:08,629
ryan how are you today good morning
okay so remember we talked about the

6
00:00:08,629 --> 00:00:08,639
okay so remember we talked about the
 

7
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,390
okay so remember we talked about the
square root right squared

8
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:10,400
square root right squared
 

9
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,669
square root right squared
yeah right square root 25 what is the

10
00:00:13,669 --> 00:00:13,679
yeah right square root 25 what is the
 

11
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:14,910
yeah right square root 25 what is the
answer

12
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:14,920
answer
 

13
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,830
answer
five right we're done okay so so today

14
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:17,840
five right we're done okay so so today
 

15
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:18,550
five right we're done okay so so today
we uh

16
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:18,560
we uh
 

17
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,550
we uh
and previously we talked about using the

18
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:20,560
and previously we talked about using the
 

19
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,790
and previously we talked about using the
binary search to

20
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:22,800
binary search to
 

21
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,550
binary search to
to compute the loop by at the root yeah

22
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:26,560
to compute the loop by at the root yeah
 

23
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,790
to compute the loop by at the root yeah
do you still remember yeah for example

24
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:28,800
do you still remember yeah for example
 

25
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,550
do you still remember yeah for example
like 25 so we

26
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:30,560
like 25 so we
 

27
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,750
like 25 so we
choose the left equals zero and right

28
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:33,760
choose the left equals zero and right
 

29
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,750
choose the left equals zero and right
equals 25 and then we calculate the

30
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:35,760
equals 25 and then we calculate the
 

31
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,950
equals 25 and then we calculate the
meter yeah

32
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:36,960
meter yeah
 

33
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,350
meter yeah
yeah and we compare the meter square

34
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:39,360
yeah and we compare the meter square
 

35
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,310
yeah and we compare the meter square
really

36
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:40,320
really
 

37
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,350
really
we compare the mean square to 25

38
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:43,360
we compare the mean square to 25
 

39
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,069
we compare the mean square to 25
to 25 and then depending on which side

40
00:00:46,069 --> 00:00:46,079
to 25 and then depending on which side
 

41
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,750
to 25 and then depending on which side
it is we continue to search

42
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:47,760
it is we continue to search
 

43
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,270
it is we continue to search
in a half space right yes until we

44
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:51,280
in a half space right yes until we
 

45
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,150
in a half space right yes until we
we have this reasonably closed solution

46
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:54,160
we have this reasonably closed solution
 

47
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:54,549
we have this reasonably closed solution
right

48
00:00:54,549 --> 00:00:54,559
right
 

49
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,830
right
do you get it yes

50
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:57,840
do you get it yes
 

51
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,110
do you get it yes
so today we talked about another another

52
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:01,120
so today we talked about another another
 

53
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,630
so today we talked about another another
solution is to

54
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:02,640
solution is to
 

55
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,869
solution is to
compute it because you only need to

56
00:01:04,869 --> 00:01:04,879
compute it because you only need to
 

57
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:05,990
compute it because you only need to
compute it how can

58
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:06,000
compute it how can
 

59
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,030
compute it how can
it look so let's say we want to compute

60
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:09,040
it look so let's say we want to compute
 

61
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,149
it look so let's say we want to compute
the square root of n

62
00:01:10,149 --> 00:01:10,159
the square root of n
 

63
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,789
the square root of n
right all right can you see that please

64
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:12,799
right all right can you see that please
 

65
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,310
right all right can you see that please
we want to compute this

66
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:14,320
we want to compute this
 

67
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,550
we want to compute this
square root of number n and then

68
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:18,560
square root of number n and then
 

69
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,070
square root of number n and then
if i said n is equals

70
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:22,080
if i said n is equals
 

71
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,749
if i said n is equals
a squared plus b where a is a square is

72
00:01:25,749 --> 00:01:25,759
a squared plus b where a is a square is
 

73
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:26,710
a squared plus b where a is a square is
bigger

74
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:26,720
bigger
 

75
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,670
bigger
bigger than b right so for example like

76
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:29,680
bigger than b right so for example like
 

77
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,270
bigger than b right so for example like
i want to calculate 100

78
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:31,280
i want to calculate 100
 

79
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,749
i want to calculate 100
100 150 what's the square root of 150

80
00:01:35,749 --> 00:01:35,759
100 150 what's the square root of 150
 

81
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,870
100 150 what's the square root of 150
so it equals to

82
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:38,880
so it equals to
 

83
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,469
so it equals to
which which number square itself is

84
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:42,479
which which number square itself is
 

85
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:48,389
which which number square itself is
less than 150 by the biggest

86
00:01:48,389 --> 00:01:48,399

 

87
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,270

10 11 12 30 12 yes exactly

88
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:53,280
10 11 12 30 12 yes exactly
 

89
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,230
10 11 12 30 12 yes exactly
10 squared plus b right yeah so 12

90
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:56,240
10 squared plus b right yeah so 12
 

91
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,350
10 squared plus b right yeah so 12
squared plus 6

92
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:57,360
squared plus 6
 

93
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,709
squared plus 6
right okay yes yes

94
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:00,719
right okay yes yes
 

95
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,469
right okay yes yes
okay okay so remember a is 12

96
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:04,479
okay okay so remember a is 12
 

97
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,190
okay okay so remember a is 12
b is 6 okay so they get it a is try

98
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:07,200
b is 6 okay so they get it a is try
 

99
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,630
b is 6 okay so they get it a is try
something

100
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:08,640
something
 

101
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,670
something
yeah so we basically we try we we we

102
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:11,680
yeah so we basically we try we we we
 

103
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,710
yeah so we basically we try we we we
guess the big is the square number

104
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:14,720
guess the big is the square number
 

105
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,150
guess the big is the square number
that is less than the target right so

106
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:18,160
that is less than the target right so
 

107
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,030
that is less than the target right so
let's see a n equal let's do this n

108
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:21,040
let's see a n equal let's do this n
 

109
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,470
let's see a n equal let's do this n
equals a squared plus b

110
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:22,480
equals a squared plus b
 

111
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,830
equals a squared plus b
okay so what can we do is n minus

112
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:25,840
okay so what can we do is n minus
 

113
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,350
okay so what can we do is n minus
a n minus a square

114
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:29,360
a n minus a square
 

115
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,350
a n minus a square
equals equals b right yes

116
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:33,360
equals equals b right yes
 

117
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,589
equals equals b right yes
so do you still remember this formula

118
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:35,599
so do you still remember this formula
 

119
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:36,949
so do you still remember this formula
eric like

120
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:36,959
eric like
 

121
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,229
eric like
a plus b times a minus b

122
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:40,239
a plus b times a minus b
 

123
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,630
a plus b times a minus b
what does it equal

124
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:44,640

 

125
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,750

what does it equal a squared minus

126
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:47,760
what does it equal a squared minus
 

127
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,030
what does it equal a squared minus
b squared okay a plus b like

128
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,040
b squared okay a plus b like
 

129
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,630
b squared okay a plus b like
2 plus 1 times 2 minus 1

130
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:54,640
2 plus 1 times 2 minus 1
 

131
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,910
2 plus 1 times 2 minus 1
equals 2 square minus minus 1 squared

132
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:57,920
equals 2 square minus minus 1 squared
 

133
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,790
equals 2 square minus minus 1 squared
equals 3

134
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:58,800
equals 3
 

135
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,790
equals 3
right 3 times 1 is 3. correct yes

136
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:02,800
right 3 times 1 is 3. correct yes
 

137
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,790
right 3 times 1 is 3. correct yes
yes okay okay so

138
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:06,800
yes okay okay so
 

139
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,670
yes okay okay so
okay let me give you an another example

140
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:09,680
okay let me give you an another example
 

141
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,670
okay let me give you an another example
uh

142
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:11,680
uh
 

143
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,350
uh
5 plus 3 times

144
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:15,360
5 plus 3 times
 

145
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:31,030
5 plus 3 times
5 minus 3 equals 1.

146
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,040

 

147
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,070

16. yeah okay okay yeah

148
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:34,080
16. yeah okay okay yeah
 

149
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,990
16. yeah okay okay yeah
it's amazing yeah why are you while

150
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,000
it's amazing yeah why are you while
 

151
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,070
it's amazing yeah why are you while
you're missing the times

152
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:38,080
you're missing the times
 

153
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,190
you're missing the times
okay that's okay okay now look

154
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:41,200
okay that's okay okay now look
 

155
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,550
okay that's okay okay now look
so look what's this and this is

156
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:44,560
so look what's this and this is
 

157
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,309
so look what's this and this is
a square root of n plus a

158
00:03:48,309 --> 00:03:48,319
a square root of n plus a
 

159
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,070
a square root of n plus a
times square minus n a right you get it

160
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:52,080
times square minus n a right you get it
 

161
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,390
times square minus n a right you get it
because look

162
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:54,400
because look
 

163
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,830
because look
this square

164
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:57,840
this square
 

165
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,509
this square
is n right yeah and then a square right

166
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:01,519
is n right yeah and then a square right
 

167
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,350
is n right yeah and then a square right
do you get it okay yeah

168
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:05,360
do you get it okay yeah
 

169
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,149
do you get it okay yeah
so this will be and uh a square right

170
00:04:08,149 --> 00:04:08,159
so this will be and uh a square right
 

171
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,030
so this will be and uh a square right
okay

172
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:09,040
okay
 

173
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,470
okay
so look the lease is left

174
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:12,480
so look the lease is left
 

175
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,589
so look the lease is left
so what can we get all right look

176
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:15,599
so what can we get all right look
 

177
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,349
so what can we get all right look
what can we get so b if we move

178
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:19,359
what can we get so b if we move
 

179
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,950
what can we get so b if we move
move this thing uh move this thing

180
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:22,960
move this thing uh move this thing
 

181
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,790
move this thing uh move this thing
okay move these things to the right

182
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:24,800
okay move these things to the right
 

183
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,310
okay move these things to the right
it'll be

184
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:26,320
it'll be
 

185
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,350
it'll be
b divided by square root plus

186
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:29,360
b divided by square root plus
 

187
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,950
b divided by square root plus
n a right and then

188
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:32,960
n a right and then
 

189
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,950
n a right and then
that will be equals to this one right

190
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:34,960
that will be equals to this one right
 

191
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,310
that will be equals to this one right
look

192
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:36,320
look
 

193
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,150
look
and now what happens if i move the a to

194
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:38,160
and now what happens if i move the a to
 

195
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,710
and now what happens if i move the a to
left to the right hand side

196
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:40,720
left to the right hand side
 

197
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,990
left to the right hand side
so that will be plus

198
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,000
so that will be plus
 

199
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,550
so that will be plus
uh plus a right yeah all right

200
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:48,560
uh plus a right yeah all right
 

201
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,830
uh plus a right yeah all right
look look this is the thing we want to

202
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:51,840
look look this is the thing we want to
 

203
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,469
look look this is the thing we want to
compute yeah square root of m yeah and

204
00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:54,479
compute yeah square root of m yeah and
 

205
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,150
compute yeah square root of m yeah and
this is the square root of n

206
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:56,160
this is the square root of n
 

207
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,270
this is the square root of n
we are going to compute so look let me

208
00:04:59,270 --> 00:04:59,280
we are going to compute so look let me
 

209
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,310
we are going to compute so look let me
let me y again

210
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:00,320
let me y again
 

211
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,230
let me y again
square root of n equals p a plus b

212
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:04,240
square root of n equals p a plus b
 

213
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,189
square root of n equals p a plus b
a plus square root of n so what happened

214
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:07,199
a plus square root of n so what happened
 

215
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,950
a plus square root of n so what happened
look this is the magic yeah

216
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:08,960
look this is the magic yeah
 

217
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,150
look this is the magic yeah
what happens if i look

218
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:12,160
what happens if i look
 

219
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,550
what happens if i look
replace this bit with this bit

220
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:16,560
replace this bit with this bit
 

221
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,749
replace this bit with this bit
this is okay look at square root of m

222
00:05:19,749 --> 00:05:19,759
this is okay look at square root of m
 

223
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,390
this is okay look at square root of m
equals a plus b divided by a plus square

224
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:22,400
equals a plus b divided by a plus square
 

225
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,510
equals a plus b divided by a plus square
root of n

226
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:23,520
root of n
 

227
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,350
root of n
okay what square root of n is this one

228
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:25,360
okay what square root of n is this one
 

229
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,230
okay what square root of n is this one
yeah so if i remove this

230
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:28,240
yeah so if i remove this
 

231
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,070
yeah so if i remove this
and then i replace this the whole thing

232
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:30,080
and then i replace this the whole thing
 

233
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,590
and then i replace this the whole thing
b divided by a plus

234
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:35,600

 

235
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,870

square root of n right

236
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:38,880
square root of n right
 

237
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,150
square root of n right
uh a a plus left a plus n so that would

238
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:42,160
uh a a plus left a plus n so that would
 

239
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:42,870
uh a a plus left a plus n so that would
be two a

240
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:42,880
be two a
 

241
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,909
be two a
yeah all right t times a

242
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:45,919
yeah all right t times a
 

243
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,550
yeah all right t times a
yeah yeah all right this will be the

244
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:48,560
yeah yeah all right this will be the
 

245
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,749
yeah yeah all right this will be the
same so you'll be

246
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:49,759
same so you'll be
 

247
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,710
same so you'll be
b a plus b divided by 2a plus b divided

248
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:52,720
b a plus b divided by 2a plus b divided
 

249
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,230
b a plus b divided by 2a plus b divided
by 2a plus

250
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:54,240
by 2a plus
 

251
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,830
by 2a plus
b divided by 2a plus b divided by 2a so

252
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:57,840
b divided by 2a plus b divided by 2a so
 

253
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,710
b divided by 2a plus b divided by 2a so
it continues that way

254
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:00,720
it continues that way
 

255
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,790
it continues that way
do you see the magic okay look

256
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:04,800
do you see the magic okay look
 

257
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,150
do you see the magic okay look
these originally is this okay

258
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,160
these originally is this okay
 

259
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,309
these originally is this okay
because look square root of n we want to

260
00:06:10,309 --> 00:06:10,319
because look square root of n we want to
 

261
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,749
because look square root of n we want to
calculate the square root of n

262
00:06:11,749 --> 00:06:11,759
calculate the square root of n
 

263
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,909
calculate the square root of n
right and then it has square root of n

264
00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:13,919
right and then it has square root of n
 

265
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,670
right and then it has square root of n
in the right hand side right

266
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:15,680
in the right hand side right
 

267
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,950
in the right hand side right
yeah so if i remove this

268
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:18,960
yeah so if i remove this
 

269
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,710
yeah so if i remove this
and i take this whole thing what's n

270
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:22,720
and i take this whole thing what's n
 

271
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,430
and i take this whole thing what's n
what's 0 the n equals a plus square root

272
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:25,440
what's 0 the n equals a plus square root
 

273
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,870
what's 0 the n equals a plus square root
of n so that will be

274
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:26,880
of n so that will be
 

275
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,150
of n so that will be
b a

276
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:30,160
b a
 

277
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,189
b a
plus square root of n and plus

278
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:33,199
plus square root of n and plus
 

279
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,230
plus square root of n and plus
a right a plus that yeah and then look a

280
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:36,240
a right a plus that yeah and then look a
 

281
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,629
a right a plus that yeah and then look a
plus a that would be 2a

282
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:38,639
plus a that would be 2a
 

283
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,990
plus a that would be 2a
right so you can continue replacing this

284
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:42,000
right so you can continue replacing this
 

285
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,790
right so you can continue replacing this
square root of

286
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:42,800
square root of
 

287
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,270
square root of
n and then you come to this way so

288
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:45,280
n and then you come to this way so
 

289
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,790
n and then you come to this way so
square root of n equals

290
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:46,800
square root of n equals
 

291
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,589
square root of n equals
a plus b divided by 2a plus b divided by

292
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:49,599
a plus b divided by 2a plus b divided by
 

293
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,749
a plus b divided by 2a plus b divided by
2a plus b divided by 2a

294
00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:51,759
2a plus b divided by 2a
 

295
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,550
2a plus b divided by 2a
this way continue right all right

296
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:56,560

 

297
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,589

so so so we can do this so

298
00:06:59,589 --> 00:06:59,599
so so so we can do this so
 

299
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,189
so so so we can do this so
by a we know this and b we know this a

300
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:03,199
by a we know this and b we know this a
 

301
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,749
by a we know this and b we know this a
b the square root of n is just the

302
00:07:05,749 --> 00:07:05,759
b the square root of n is just the
 

303
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,870
b the square root of n is just the
calculation of b

304
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:06,880
calculation of b
 

305
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,390
calculation of b
and a right all right all right are you

306
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:10,400
and a right all right all right are you
 

307
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,270
and a right all right all right are you
still with me

yeah okay a as b
 

311
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,150
yeah okay a as b
by so look at that let me look so square

312
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:18,160
by so look at that let me look so square
 

313
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,950
by so look at that let me look so square
root of n

314
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:18,960
root of n
 

315
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,150
root of n
equals b a plus

316
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:22,160
equals b a plus
 

317
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,749
equals b a plus
b divided by 2 a plus b

318
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:25,759
b divided by 2 a plus b
 

319

so look let's do this define let's call
 

329
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,589
so look let's do this define let's call
it square root right square root

330
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:41,599
it square root right square root
 

331
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,309
it square root right square root
and we call it we want to calculate n

332
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:44,319
and we call it we want to calculate n
 

333
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,189
and we call it we want to calculate n
but we need to use the a

334
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:47,199
but we need to use the a
 

335
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,309
but we need to use the a
yeah and let's define

336
00:07:50,309 --> 00:07:50,319
yeah and let's define
 

337
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,749
yeah and let's define
a small error small error so if you want

338
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:53,759
a small error small error so if you want
 

339
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,189
a small error small error so if you want
to compare two numbers if

340
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:55,199
to compare two numbers if
 

341
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,309
to compare two numbers if
they're the same you can if

342
00:07:58,309 --> 00:07:58,319
they're the same you can if
 

343
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,790
they're the same you can if
two floating numbers like you want to

344
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:00,800
two floating numbers like you want to
 

345
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,869
two floating numbers like you want to
compute the two floating number if they

346
00:08:02,869 --> 00:08:02,879
compute the two floating number if they
 

347
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:03,909
compute the two floating number if they
are the same

348
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:03,919
are the same
 

349
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,749
are the same
i mean they are very close you can use

350
00:08:05,749 --> 00:08:05,759
i mean they are very close you can use
 

351
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:06,950
i mean they are very close you can use
the abs

352
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:06,960
the abs
 

353
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,990
the abs
do you still remember abs

354
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,000
do you still remember abs
 

355
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,270
do you still remember abs
a minus b if it's smaller or equal

356
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:13,280
a minus b if it's smaller or equal
 

357
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,950
a minus b if it's smaller or equal
a very small number like 0.0001

358
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:16,960
a very small number like 0.0001
 

359
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,350
a very small number like 0.0001
then we can say a and b are equal right

360
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:19,360
then we can say a and b are equal right
 

361
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,110
then we can say a and b are equal right
because in computer

362
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:21,120
because in computer
 

363
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,309
because in computer
you cannot because of a computer the way

364
00:08:24,309 --> 00:08:24,319
you cannot because of a computer the way
 

365
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,230
you cannot because of a computer the way
how computers represent

366
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:26,240
how computers represent
 

367
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,950
how computers represent
the floating numbers the best way to

368
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:28,960
the floating numbers the best way to
 

369
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,710
the floating numbers the best way to
compare the equity

370
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:30,720
compare the equity
 

371
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,190
compare the equity
is to use the abs do you still remember

372
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:33,200
is to use the abs do you still remember
 

373
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,149
is to use the abs do you still remember
your abs

374
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:36,159

 

375
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,870

abs look in mathematics you can do this

376
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:38,880
abs look in mathematics you can do this
 

377
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,430
abs look in mathematics you can do this
abs

378
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:39,440
abs
 

379
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,469
abs
minus three equals one

380
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:42,479
minus three equals one
 

381
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,030
minus three equals one
it's the distance between the value and

382
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,040
it's the distance between the value and
 

383
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,470
it's the distance between the value and
zero

384
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:46,480
zero
 

385
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,550
zero
three a equals one

386
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:50,560
three a equals one
 

387
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,150
three a equals one
eight yeah so basically abs is

388
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:54,160
eight yeah so basically abs is
 

389
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,509
eight yeah so basically abs is
you can say abs is x if if

390
00:08:57,509 --> 00:08:57,519
you can say abs is x if if
 

391
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,710
you can say abs is x if if
x is bigger or equal to zero or minus x

392
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:00,720
x is bigger or equal to zero or minus x
 

393
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,470
x is bigger or equal to zero or minus x
if if x is smaller than zero okay

394
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:04,480
if if x is smaller than zero okay
 

395
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,509
if if x is smaller than zero okay
yes this is called a function fbs

396
00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:07,519
yes this is called a function fbs
 

397
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,310
yes this is called a function fbs
okay so we use the abs to compare these

398
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:10,320
okay so we use the abs to compare these
 

399
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,070
okay so we use the abs to compare these
two numbers if they are floating numbers

400
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:12,080
two numbers if they are floating numbers
 

401
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,350
two numbers if they are floating numbers
like 0.5

402
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:13,360
like 0.5
 

403
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,870
like 0.5
2.5 if there are difference yeah

404
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:16,880
2.5 if there are difference yeah
 

405
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,430
2.5 if there are difference yeah
if the distance between them is smaller

406
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:19,440
if the distance between them is smaller
 

407
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,790
if the distance between them is smaller
than a number

408
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:20,800
than a number
 

409
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,389
than a number
we can say it's equal right okay so now

410
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:24,399
we can say it's equal right okay so now
 

411
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,750
we can say it's equal right okay so now
we can call this ebs epa error here

412
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:27,760
we can call this ebs epa error here
 

413
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,350
we can call this ebs epa error here
we put an e comma okay yeah

414
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:31,360
we put an e comma okay yeah
 

415
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,150
we put an e comma okay yeah
whatever e we can do by default value we

416
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:34,160
whatever e we can do by default value we
 

417
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:34,870
whatever e we can do by default value we
can say

418
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:34,880
can say
 

419
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,430
can say
one e minus five what does it mean one e

420
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:37,440
one e minus five what does it mean one e
 

421
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,949
one e minus five what does it mean one e
minus five

422
00:09:38,949 --> 00:09:38,959
minus five
 

423
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,870
minus five
scientific number this is the way in

424
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:40,880
scientific number this is the way in
 

425
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,310
scientific number this is the way in
computer we represent

426
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:42,320
computer we represent
 

427
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,590
computer we represent
one e minus five is like zero point zero

428
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:45,600
one e minus five is like zero point zero
 

429
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,269
one e minus five is like zero point zero
zero zero zero

430
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:47,279
zero zero zero
 

431
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,790
zero zero zero
one okay so uh five actually

432
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:50,800
one okay so uh five actually
 

433
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,509
one okay so uh five actually
one two three four another side so five

434
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:53,519
one two three four another side so five
 

435
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,230
one two three four another side so five
zeros

436
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:54,240
zeros
 

437
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,350
zeros
yeah okay so that's the small number is

438
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:57,360
yeah okay so that's the small number is
 

439
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:57,990
yeah okay so that's the small number is
the same and

440
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,000
the same and
 

441
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,069
the same and
one in minus two one e minus two is what

442
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:02,079
one in minus two one e minus two is what
 

443
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:09,030
one in minus two one e minus two is what
zero point zero one okay yes

444
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:09,040

 

445
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,030

okay so p what's p p equals y

446
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:13,040
okay so p what's p p equals y
 

447
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,230
okay so p what's p p equals y
we want to calculate p n equals a

448
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:16,240
we want to calculate p n equals a
 

449
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,590
we want to calculate p n equals a
squared plus b

450
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:17,600
squared plus b
 

451
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,710
squared plus b
so what's b equals

452
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:20,720
so what's b equals
 

453
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,750
so what's b equals
n minus a squared

454
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:23,760
n minus a squared
 

455
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,069
n minus a squared
a times a okay or a squared square you

456
00:10:26,069 --> 00:10:26,079
a times a okay or a squared square you
 

457
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:26,870
a times a okay or a squared square you
can use

458
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:26,880
can use
 

459
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,910
can use
double star yeah

460
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:29,920
double star yeah
 

461
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,269
double star yeah
so we have n a we have a b

462
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:33,279
so we have n a we have a b
 

463
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:37,030
so we have n a we have a b
okay yeah so look now we want to

464
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:37,040
okay yeah so look now we want to
 

465
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:37,670
okay yeah so look now we want to
calculate

466
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:37,680
calculate
 

467
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,150
calculate
x x y so x x will be equals let's try x

468
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:42,160
x x y so x x will be equals let's try x
 

469
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,590
x x y so x x will be equals let's try x
x is the x is the the number we want to

470
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:45,600
x is the x is the the number we want to
 

471
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,069
x is the x is the the number we want to
calculate

472
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:46,079
calculate
 

473
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,590
calculate
right is best yeah x equals a

474
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:49,600
right is best yeah x equals a
 

475
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,829
right is best yeah x equals a
plus b divided by

476
00:10:53,829 --> 00:10:53,839
plus b divided by
 

477
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,870
plus b divided by
let's do it divided by a okay yeah it's

478
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:56,880
let's do it divided by a okay yeah it's
 

479
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,110
let's do it divided by a okay yeah it's
2a but actually

480
00:10:59,110 --> 00:10:59,120
2a but actually
 

481
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,430
2a but actually
i'll show you why it we should put a

482
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:01,440
i'll show you why it we should put a
 

483
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,150
i'll show you why it we should put a
here

484
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:02,160
here
 

485
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,949
here
so look why why abs

486
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:06,959
so look why why abs
 

487
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:11,350
so look why why abs
x times x yeah x times x

488
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:11,360
x times x yeah x times x
 

489
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,430
x times x yeah x times x
minus which number we are comparing

490
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:15,440
minus which number we are comparing
 

491
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,069
minus which number we are comparing
we want to find the distance between the

492
00:11:18,069 --> 00:11:18,079
we want to find the distance between the
 

493
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,430
we want to find the distance between the
value of the target value

494
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:19,440
value of the target value
 

495
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,269
value of the target value
and n if it's bigger than e

496
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:23,279
and n if it's bigger than e
 

497
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,110
and n if it's bigger than e
right if the number if the x

498
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:27,120
right if the number if the x
 

499
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,710
right if the number if the x
if the target is not close enough right

500
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:30,720
if the target is not close enough right
 

501
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,190
if the target is not close enough right
yes yeah then what should we do

502
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:35,200
yes yeah then what should we do
 

503
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,350
yes yeah then what should we do
and you can imagine what should i return

504
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:37,360
and you can imagine what should i return
 

505
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,190
and you can imagine what should i return
here return what

506
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:39,200
here return what
 

507
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,269
here return what
i want to do something here but you tell

508
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:41,279
i want to do something here but you tell
 

509
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,110
i want to do something here but you tell
me what what's your life return

510
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:43,120
me what what's your life return
 

511
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,110
me what what's your life return
return there once you understand that

512
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:47,120
return there once you understand that
 

513
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,629
return there once you understand that
x return x yes

514
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:50,639
x return x yes
 

515
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,550
x return x yes
yeah because this x is the target okay

516
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:52,560
yeah because this x is the target okay
 

517
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,590
yeah because this x is the target okay
so now

518
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:55,600

 

519
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,470

so we need to

520
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:00,480

 

521
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,190

so we we need to replace this speed okay

522
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:03,200
so we we need to replace this speed okay
 

523
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:03,990
so we we need to replace this speed okay
so let's say

524
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:04,000
so let's say
 

525
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,030
so let's say
t will be equals x okay let's save this

526
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:07,040
t will be equals x okay let's save this
 

527
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,230
t will be equals x okay let's save this
value

528
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:08,240
value
 

529
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,750
value
and then another and then and when we

530
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:11,760
and then another and then and when we
 

531
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,670
and then another and then and when we
need to calculate these

532
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:13,680
need to calculate these
 

533
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,350
need to calculate these
um this new new value of the

534
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:17,360
um this new new value of the
 

535
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,509
um this new new value of the
of that of the t value yeah so what does

536
00:12:19,509 --> 00:12:19,519
of that of the t value yeah so what does
 

537
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,629
of that of the t value yeah so what does
it equal

538
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:22,639

 

539
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:36,949

what is

540
00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:36,959

 

541
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,750

plus b divided by

542
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:41,760

 

543
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,030

t x

544
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,040
t x
 

545
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,150
t x
and and t will be

546
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:48,160
and and t will be
 

547
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,670
and and t will be
will be one you guess so y plus b

548
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:51,680
will be one you guess so y plus b
 

549
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,870
will be one you guess so y plus b
divided by x now i actually realize the

550
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:54,880
divided by x now i actually realize the
 

551
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,550
divided by x now i actually realize the
problem with that is that

552
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:58,560

 

553
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,829

look this t is x so x

554
00:13:01,829 --> 00:13:01,839
look this t is x so x
 

555
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,030
look this t is x so x
is that it it's actually one a

556
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:05,040
is that it it's actually one a
 

557
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,150
is that it it's actually one a
this is one a actually we want another

558
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:08,160
this is one a actually we want another
 

559
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,990
this is one a actually we want another
a plus t right so look because look

560
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:12,000
a plus t right so look because look
 

561
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,910
a plus t right so look because look
a this a will be a and then plus a right

562
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:15,920
a this a will be a and then plus a right
 

563
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,430
a this a will be a and then plus a right
so plus a a plus that and this thing

564
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:19,440
so plus a a plus that and this thing
 

565
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,470
so plus a a plus that and this thing
this thing is the new look a plus b

566
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:22,480
this thing is the new look a plus b
 

567
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,150
this thing is the new look a plus b
divided by a plus a plus b divided by 2a

568
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:26,160
divided by a plus a plus b divided by 2a
 

569
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:26,870
divided by a plus a plus b divided by 2a
i i

570
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:26,880
i i
 

571
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,350
i i
split it into a plus a right so what i'm

572
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:29,360
split it into a plus a right so what i'm
 

573
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,550
split it into a plus a right so what i'm
doing is

574
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:30,560
doing is
 

575
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,069
doing is
a plus b divided by a plus t so this

576
00:13:34,069 --> 00:13:34,079
a plus b divided by a plus t so this
 

577
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,150
a plus b divided by a plus t so this
t thing is this new new iteration yeah

578
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,160
t thing is this new new iteration yeah
 

579
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,069
t thing is this new new iteration yeah
so it will be t and then i need to

580
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:40,079
so it will be t and then i need to
 

581
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:44,069
so it will be t and then i need to
substitute it with what

582
00:13:44,069 --> 00:13:44,079

 

583
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:48,710

x well so look x so uh

584
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:48,720
x well so look x so uh
 

585
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,230
x well so look x so uh
t equals x look t the first iteration is

586
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:52,240
t equals x look t the first iteration is
 

587
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:52,470
t equals x look t the first iteration is
t

588
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:52,480
t
 

589
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,430
t
equals x right right because this is the

590
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:55,440
equals x right right because this is the
 

591
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,069
equals x right right because this is the
value

592
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:56,079
value
 

593
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,910
value
we guess but it's not close enough but

594
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:57,920
we guess but it's not close enough but
 

595
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,509
we guess but it's not close enough but
we we plug it

596
00:13:59,509 --> 00:13:59,519
we we plug it
 

597
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,189
we we plug it
into these then will be

598
00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:03,199
into these then will be
 

599
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,710
into these then will be
a the the first iteration will be a plus

600
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:06,720
a the the first iteration will be a plus
 

601
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,990
a the the first iteration will be a plus
a that'll be 2a right yes look

602
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:10,000
a that'll be 2a right yes look
 

603
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,110
a that'll be 2a right yes look
it's 2a right so is that enough

604
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:15,120

 

605
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,670

is not enough

606
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:19,680

 

607
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,790

yes i think so yes yes i think so so

608
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:22,800
yes i think so yes yes i think so so
 

609
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,750
yes i think so yes yes i think so so
so look this is the way we iterative to

610
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:25,760
so look this is the way we iterative to
 

611
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,790
so look this is the way we iterative to
computer

612
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:26,800
computer
 

613
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,790
computer
but a computer

614
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:30,800
but a computer
 

615
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,470
but a computer
compute the square root based on this

616
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:32,480
compute the square root based on this
 

617
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,870
compute the square root based on this
equation right yeah

618
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:34,880
equation right yeah
 

619
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,389
equation right yeah
okay okay so now

620
00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:38,399

 

621
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,990

and in order to calculate the square

622
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:40,000
and in order to calculate the square
 

623
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,829
and in order to calculate the square
root of 150

624
00:14:41,829 --> 00:14:41,839
root of 150
 

625
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,069
root of 150
you need to pass the value of a as well

626
00:14:44,069 --> 00:14:44,079
you need to pass the value of a as well
 

627
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,509
you need to pass the value of a as well
right how do we pass

628
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:45,519
right how do we pass
 

629
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,350
right how do we pass
how do we calculate the evaluate

630
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:49,360
how do we calculate the evaluate
 

631
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,030
how do we calculate the evaluate
the integer bar i mean it's just in

632
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:53,040
the integer bar i mean it's just in
 

633
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,949
the integer bar i mean it's just in
a b square and if it's smaller than x

634
00:14:56,949 --> 00:14:56,959
a b square and if it's smaller than x
 

635
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,350
a b square and if it's smaller than x
so if we just the integral integer part

636
00:14:59,350 --> 00:14:59,360
so if we just the integral integer part
 

637
00:14:59,360 --> 00:14:59,990
so if we just the integral integer part
of it

638
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:00,000
of it
 

639
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,230
of it
so this is actually this is the way to

640
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:02,240
so this is actually this is the way to
 

641
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,829
so this is actually this is the way to
show how you calculate it but

642
00:15:03,829 --> 00:15:03,839
show how you calculate it but
 

643
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,150
show how you calculate it but
in practically it's not it's not fast

644
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:06,160
in practically it's not it's not fast
 

645
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,509
in practically it's not it's not fast
enough because if you want to get the

646
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:07,519
enough because if you want to get the
 

647
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,350
enough because if you want to get the
value of a you need to call this square

648
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:09,360
value of a you need to call this square
 

649
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,069
value of a you need to call this square
root function

650
00:15:10,069 --> 00:15:10,079
root function
 

651
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,150
root function
and if you want to use this square root

652
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:12,160
and if you want to use this square root
 

653
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,069
and if you want to use this square root
function what why would you do this

654
00:15:14,069 --> 00:15:14,079
function what why would you do this
 

655
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,189
function what why would you do this
because it's way slower right but um and

656
00:15:17,189 --> 00:15:17,199
because it's way slower right but um and
 

657
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,069
because it's way slower right but um and
this is the way to calculate these uh

658
00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:20,079
this is the way to calculate these uh
 

659

and six correct so if
 

699
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,310
and six correct so if
i i i put it that way so that would be

700
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:22,320
i i i put it that way so that would be
 

701
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,749
i i i put it that way so that would be
97 24 plus

that's right uh let's do this okay
 

707
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,230
that's right uh let's do this okay
24 divided by 97 okay 24

708
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:36,240
24 divided by 97 okay 24
 

709
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,350
24 divided by 97 okay 24
divided by 97. what is what does equal

710
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:39,360
divided by 97. what is what does equal
 

711
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,550
divided by 97. what is what does equal
i guess look there's a zero yeah so

712
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:42,560
i guess look there's a zero yeah so
 

713
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:42,949
i guess look there's a zero yeah so
that's

714
00:16:42,949 --> 00:16:42,959
that's
 

715
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,069
that's
yellow point

and then 7
 

731
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,150
and then 7
and more let's see so we have a

732
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:18,160
and more let's see so we have a
 

733
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,949
and more let's see so we have a
very close number is 12 12.24 okay

734
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:22,959
very close number is 12 12.24 okay

yeah uh
 

737
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,669
yeah uh
so let's let's square this number okay

738
00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:29,679
so let's let's square this number okay
 

739
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,909
so let's let's square this number okay
let's use computer to spray let's see

740
00:17:31,909 --> 00:17:31,919
let's use computer to spray let's see
 

741
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,230
let's use computer to spray let's see
what's what does it equal okay

742
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:34,240
what's what does it equal okay
 

743
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,270
what's what does it equal okay
okay so let's see

744
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:37,280

 

745
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,150

square they can't see it that's okay

746
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:40,160
square they can't see it that's okay
 

747
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,230
square they can't see it that's okay
squares
