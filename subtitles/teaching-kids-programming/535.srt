1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
right

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:05,339
yeah

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,620
Okay so

4
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:09,900
we talk about a gene right the human

5
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,960
body Gene

6
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:15,780
basis to uh determine like the color of

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,220
your hair right the height yeah

8
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,440
something like that the color of your

9
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:22,560
eyes brown there are only four types of

10
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:28,980
gin a c g t like do you still remember

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:32,520
no a pair with the c a t um eight pairs

12
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:35,880
T right C pairs with juice yes

13
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:38,820
because C looks like DNA looks like t a

14
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:43,260
t c g yeah so look it comes with these

15
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:45,719
pairs DNA blood yeah your DNA so it's

16
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:48,899
it's like the two you know uh a pair so

17
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:51,480
if this is a and it pairs with t and if

18
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:54,120
this is T this pairs with a

19
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:57,539
so if this is C pairs with G if this is

20
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,879
G pair with C okay so what's the

21
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:02,100
advantage of this pair

22
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:04,260
can you think of one advantage if we

23
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,880
know if this is G and then we definitely

24
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:10,140
no the other side is C

25
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:11,580
yeah if you have one like if you have a

26
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,520
hole

27
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:17,580
and and you still have one side you

28
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:20,700
can't you can't you can still know if

29
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:22,680
you can say oh oh do you put pairs with

30
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,500
cs so we have a very lucky yeah yeah

31
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:28,020
yeah so look if this is broken yeah so

32
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:31,920
we know we can repair it

33
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:34,680
yeah so your human body DNA knows how to

34
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,439
repair itself if one of it is broken

35
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,299
right so it's low passed does it make

36
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,400
sense you can figure out on the other

37
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:43,979
side okay yeah that's the other okay I'm

38
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:47,340
not extra on this biology just some

39
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:53,460
Quick Knowledge okay so we're given a

40
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:55,799
gene type like a a c c g g t t okay you

41
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:59,399
know size of a this is one gene type

42
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:01,680
okay and this is the star we call a

43
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,680
mutation what's mutation

44
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,680
immutable

45
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:15,060
can you change huh what's mutable

46
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:18,360
change okay so mutation

47
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:22,200
yeah mutation is that if we can change

48
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:25,560
one gene to the other for example like

49
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:27,060
any you can pick any right you see pick

50
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,700
this one and change it to some other

51
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:34,800
type like G so this is called one

52
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:37,739
mutation of of the original Gene Okay so

53
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,900
each step we can apply one mutation and

54
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:42,840
then we want to find out the minimal

55
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:47,239
step to the Target destination mutation

56
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:50,519
for example like the N the end is

57
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:55,080
a a c g

58
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:55,800
g t t Okay so from here from star to the

59
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,220
end

60
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:04,319
how many mutations do we need aacc ggt

61
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:06,540
to a a c g g t from star to the end how

62
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:09,540
many mutations do we need one because we

63
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:12,720
just pick this Gene and change it to G

64
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:17,780
okay and how about the N is

65
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:22,140
is T here how many mutations do we need

66
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:25,680
aiccgt2 a a c g g t t two

67
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:28,379
two yes because we change this to G and

68
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,920
change this to T okay so another

69
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:34,860
requirement is that we can only apply

70
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:38,700
mutation if this mutation is in a bank

71
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:41,879
in the bank so it's in uh a list of the

72
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:43,019
allowed Gene type okay it's a it's a

73
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:44,819
list okay

74
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:47,340
and then we want to find out the minimum

75
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:49,620
number of mutations from travel from

76
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,840
star to the end I understand the

77
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,819
mutation needs to be in the bank okay so

78
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,159
any idea how do we solve this problem I

79
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:58,560
mean what kind of it's like like if a

80
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:01,379
star has eight letters and the end has

81
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,140
an seven how about breakfast that's a

82
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:06,959
good yeah okay one one at a time okay

83
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:09,659
that's a very good point yes the the

84
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,599
size of the star and end is the same and

85
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:14,340
the mutation is the same so yeah if it's

86
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:18,359
different sizes there's no way you just

87
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:21,000
return uh you know Infinity okay size of

88
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:22,919
the tune is fixed and you'll say the

89
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,780
pressure what's the good thing about

90
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:27,380
breakfast search we want to find out the

91
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:29,220
minimum number

92
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:31,020
moves so we want to find out the

93
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,780
shortest distance right the five percent

94
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:36,300
is good if we want to find out the

95
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:38,100
shortest path in uh in an unweighty

96
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:42,000
graph right remember in the analytical

97
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:45,540
one mutation cost one all right so it's

98
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,520
unweighted so we can visualize this as a

99
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:49,440
graph program so each one is the gene

100
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,360
right so for example is star and then

101
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,600
the edge is a mutation this is the

102
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:57,300
mutation right mutation so another Gene

103
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,560
to another mutation Gene and then we can

104
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,720
apply this

105
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:04,440
and until we find

106
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,540
and here we find what if this is n here

107
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,940
if this is the topic we're looking for

108
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:11,160
the distance is the shortest because

109
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,240
when we apply the prefer search we can

110
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,180
guarantee

111
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:18,180
we have the shortest distance it's the

112
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:21,360
shortest to last root

113
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:25,500
as long as the graph is animated make

114
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:27,539
sense Professor yes it starts okay put

115
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,460
it here

116
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:31,259
apply this that's a search but it's not

117
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:33,840
very effective this answer may be here

118
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:36,539
right the Shorty's past maybe here but

119
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,220
whatever certifies this first hello

120
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:39,720
everyone this is not a correct answer

121
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,820
because it's not a shortage all right

122
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,400
but we talk about the iterated deepening

123
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:47,100
search for if we want to apply the

124
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:50,639
deficit to get the shortest path we can

125
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:53,460
do it two ways first one is that we do a

126
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,520
exotic search on using the data search

127
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:58,500
or to visit every node in a tree that's

128
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,000
going to take a lot of time right if the

129
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,400
tree is big

130
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,800
if because if we prove us all the tasks

131
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,900
then we know which one is associated or

132
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,380
we apply the iterated deepening search

133
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:12,660
so at the beginning we limit the tabs to

134
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:14,940
one we do the test as such if we can't

135
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:18,120
find any destination node we increase

136
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:20,699
the depth to two we do a def as such and

137
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:24,360
we increase the test to three so that's

138
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:26,639
equals one wire that's smaller than the

139
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,160
maximum then we do a lot of stuff and

140
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,020
such if that's massage with the maximum

141
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,660
T we found it then we return the answer

142
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:35,400
right otherwise t plus equal one okay so

143
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:38,100
this is the iterative difference search

144
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:40,440
and the ideas of iterative differences

145
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:43,139
is that we incremented this

146
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:45,240
set the limit and then we perform a

147
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:47,160
deficit search that's limit search we

148
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,580
perform a depth name research okay to be

149
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:52,199
exact that's limit search it means that

150
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:54,360
when the depth is bigger than the

151
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:55,860
special than the maximum test then we

152
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,380
just return okay

153
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:00,900
answer the message we use the professor

154
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:03,600
level by level and as long as we found

155
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:07,139
the destination it's the shortest okay

156
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:09,840
and in order to find the shortest path

157
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:12,360
we have to remember that notes we have

158
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,419
visited so we don't want to coming back

159
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,819
and follow us for example the a change

160
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:19,740
to T and then NT change it to a we don't

161
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:23,940
want that right because we have visited

162
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:26,460
this a and t so we need to keep it in a

163
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:29,039
hash set in a set right

164
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:31,139
this allows our one Constantine it's a

165
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,180
live notebook right notebook to look up

166
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:35,340
the notes you have visited you put it

167
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:38,160
down on a notebook so the next time you

168
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:41,280
first check if we have visited this Gene

169
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,380
with stick this note first if it's the

170
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,840
pin visited we just skip it we don't put

171
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:49,080
it down again right now two let's turn

172
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:53,599
15 into uh to visit the same time again

173
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,599
and again okay so how do we implementage

174
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:03,440
easy double-ended

175
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,180
yeah

176
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,400
means that we can apply the push and pop

177
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:10,620
operation on both sides it's both one

178
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,199
constant timeline compared to this

179
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:16,080
simple uh list in Python right because

180
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:19,080
that if this is released

181
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,240
if it is at least in Python usually the

182
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:23,220
operation on the left side is all ending

183
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:26,879
your time and on the right side is a one

184
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:28,560
so this is perfect for stack right stack

185
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,240
first thing last up but for the first

186
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,459
things first off

187
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,360
in on the right side

188
00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:38,279
out on the left side we need a DQ PQ

189
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:41,099
okay the perfect size how does it work

190
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:43,800
look look this is the binary right this

191
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:45,959
is how do we perform the professor one

192
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:48,779
two three four five six seven yeah so

193
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:51,240
first of all we initialize the Q is the

194
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:53,399
loot right we take it out we push it as

195
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:56,279
a kid which is two and three

196
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:57,600
we take one hour to push it to kick is

197
00:08:56,279 --> 00:09:00,600
four and five

198
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,600
okay

199
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:10,080
Define minimum mutation

200
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:16,860
Bank okay Bank of genes we specifies the

201
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:21,000
allowed mutation where you can travel

202
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:22,620
okay Q equals TQ at the beginning we

203
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,080
pushula

204
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:27,660
star and the couple all right the type

205
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:31,080
of we push your Tuple into the queue the

206
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:34,460
current note and the current step is the

207
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:37,589
current distance to the root is zero

208
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:37,589
[Music]

209
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:46,820
may not be in a bank

210
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:58,620
and the distance we kill the path left

211
00:09:56,459 --> 00:10:01,320
right we take one from the left hand

212
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:04,380
side so if carbon

213
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:06,600
if we have seen the destination will

214
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:08,100
return distance right look

215
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,980
we take a note

216
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:12,180
a note contains the current node and the

217
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,459
distance

218
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:16,140
and then we if we compare We compare to

219
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:17,480
the destination we have visited in

220
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:20,399
another with the tender distance

221
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:23,040
otherwise we have to check the neighbor

222
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,320
the mutations yeah we have checked my

223
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:29,120
mutations all right so how do we check

224
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:31,800
the mutation for I so look a a c c

225
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:35,399
what's the possible mutation of this

226
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:36,959
Gene how do we improve acccc how do we

227
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:39,540
prove false if we're given the type of

228
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:41,880
Gene how do we prove us the mutation we

229
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:43,560
check every possibilities yes what's up

230
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,779
every possibilities so we check the

231
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:48,180
first one first one there are four

232
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:49,860
choice right and but not including the

233
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,899
current one so the first one we have

234
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:53,820
four three the second yeah three the

235
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:56,519
second one we have three the fourth one

236
00:10:53,820 --> 00:11:00,060
we have three like the third one

237
00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:02,040
or every post everything has three times

238
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:04,019
three more times all right yeah but you

239
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,579
said that okay first one has three the

240
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:07,620
second one have read the full form has

241
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:10,079
four okay the fourth one has three okay

242
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:14,279
every because look eight I could replace

243
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:17,279
a with c g t yeah

244
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:17,279
nothing

245
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:28,440
good point no mutation has to change

246
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:30,180
something okay yeah you need to change

247
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,740
something you don't have to change all

248
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:34,380
of it

249
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:36,300
you can change nothing yeah it looks

250
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:38,640
good point yeah we have to check that on

251
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:41,399
we pick so what's mutation we pick one

252
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,800
and we can change it that's it yes we're

253
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:46,140
not picking magnet until we just pick

254
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:49,680
one and then chain so the next one could

255
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:53,220
be cacc okay or the next one will be a g

256
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:55,800
c c okay but not but not ggcc okay

257
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:58,620
because look these two change

258
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:00,180
so that's only one chain okay so for I

259
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:02,160
in range

260
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:04,680
we want to tell students each character

261
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:07,880
this is the index the length and then

262
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:11,339
the next one K in

263
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:15,360
a c g t this is only four possibility

264
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:19,440
and we want to replace the index I to K

265
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:24,060
so the new will be the carbon up to I

266
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:25,140
plus K plus carbon from I plus 1 to n

267
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:28,620
okay

268
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:31,320
and then if and in Bank well this

269
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:34,079
neighbor has to be in a bank and also

270
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:38,339
and not in scene we haven't seen this

271
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:42,120
before and seen dot add

272
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:43,560
and right I learned Q dot append we push

273
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:46,500
it back to the cube

274
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:49,200
the next one will be n and it is ten

275
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:52,200
plus one right and then if we can't find

276
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,639
it we ten minus 100 what's this the most

277
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:58,560
important thing is this one this is the

278
00:12:53,639 --> 00:13:01,620
mutation so look a a c c g g it will

279
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:04,019
take this one look we want to mutate

280
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:06,959
this C right we want to mutate this C so

281
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:08,700
what do we do the new Gene is

282
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:11,100
constructed by using the character

283
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:14,399
before right and then using the

284
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:16,079
character after at least one we can have

285
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,940
four possibilities right it doesn't

286
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:21,660
matter if we repeat this Gene it doesn't

287
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:24,120
matter because we we can have uh I mean

288
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:25,980
we have listen okay we have released the

289
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:29,760
hashtag to remember the numbers so we

290
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:32,459
replace this one with what with a c g t

291
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,380
am I and then it has to be in the bank

292
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:36,839
right this is in a bank

293
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:39,240
this is Bank

294
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:41,940
and then it's not being seen first thing

295
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:44,040
if we haven't written the note the first

296
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:47,160
thing is to put it down on a notebook so

297
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:48,660
next time we don't do it again this is

298
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,360
to put it down on the notebook and then

299
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:55,040
push it to the queue okay the time

300
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,040
complexity oh n right

301
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:05,760
you only push the note back to the queue

302
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:07,380
as long as it's in the bank all right if

303
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,180
it's not in a bank then we don't push it

304
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:12,360
okay

305
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:15,060
yeah definitely I will be

306
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:18,540
about the jeans okay so come on come on

307
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:18,540
more sentence please

308
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:23,820
come on you're not saying one tea was

309
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,019
mommy don't understand this

310
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,779
okay

311
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:30,600
some

312
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:32,880
jeans yeah and then what do we do

313
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,100
yeah and

314
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,079
so what's the problem just one step at a

315
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:39,300
time what is the problem we are trying

316
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:41,519
to solve today

317
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:44,680
and the second is the what kind of

318
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:46,740
approach and then that's it

319
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:49,220
[Music]

320
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,220
yes

321
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:54,839
um

322
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:58,019
find out mutation

323
00:14:54,839 --> 00:15:00,780
final mutations what

324
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:01,920
everything you want to keep it going

325
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:04,399
[Music]

326
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,399
we have

327
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:08,460
[Music]

328
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:17,399
we have so we have a star and the end

329
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:22,139
and this we have the see like how much

330
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:26,220
can you like mutate to to to change it

331
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:30,660
to the end and and the proof is we have

332
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:33,740
uh here we have a few and

333
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:37,680
yeah oh yeah we have this hash

334
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:39,899
cable thing so we don't do it so you

335
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,060
don't do it so you didn't change it to

336
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:44,279
it again

337
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:47,040
and what's up what's the diagram we can

338
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:49,019
talk about all about that yeah okay so

339
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,420
let me repeat okay the problem is that

340
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:54,360
we want to find out a minimum right the

341
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:57,000
shot is distance to transform to mutate

342
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:59,940
from a gene a starch into a destination

343
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,779
engine and one additional requirement is

344
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:04,680
that

345
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:07,500
the mutation has to be in the bank which

346
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:09,779
is defined allowed to move right so we

347
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:12,660
can visualize this as a graph problem

348
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:14,060
yeah yeah uh a graph problem which is

349
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:16,860
the

350
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:18,600
directed or and directly actually is

351
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:21,360
undirected right what is that because

352
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:23,940
you can change a to T and T to anyone so

353
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,579
it's undirected animated graph and

354
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:29,639
waiting means that the all the cost the

355
00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:33,720
mutations is uniform is one right so you

356
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:36,240
it costs one step to mutate from one

357
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:39,420
gene to another all right yes

358
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,399
so this is the quad problem which is

359
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:43,620
undirected annuity graph then we can

360
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:44,820
apply the preferences to find out the

361
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,680
shortest path

362
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:49,259
now prefer search we can use the

363
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:51,420
preferences to compute the shortest path

364
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:53,820
between two nodes in a graph when we

365
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:55,440
talk about that we can use the data

366
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,579
search but def research is not very

367
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,940
effective

368
00:16:56,579 --> 00:17:03,120
we can use the deficit if we install all

369
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:05,459
the exhaust ordered paths and that's

370
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,900
going to take a while let's prove us on

371
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:10,559
the path down five dollar minimum

372
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:13,199
distance from two nodes or we can use

373
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:15,360
the iterative different search so the

374
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,520
way we apply the iterative difference

375
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:20,040
search is that every time at the

376
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,679
beginning we set the maximum test to one

377
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:24,540
if we don't find we will perform at the

378
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:26,520
differences if we don't find it we

379
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:28,319
increment the depth to two and we

380
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:31,080
perform a deficit on you know with the

381
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:33,960
max limit too if we don't find it we

382
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:35,940
increment to three increment to four so

383
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,640
every time we increment the depth we

384
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:40,860
perform a depth as such yeah that

385
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,320
guarantees that uh when we find the no

386
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:45,660
it's the shortest distance to the loot

387
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:48,000
the most intuitive way is to use the

388
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:49,980
prefaces to apply the prefer search we

389
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,440
need to use the DQ double ndq first

390
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:54,720
inverse out and now we need to type a

391
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:57,360
patch set to remember the nodes we have

392
00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:00,600
visited because if we don't have at The

393
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:04,200
Notebook a mutates to T

394
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:07,260
T mutates to a a mutates to t t mutates

395
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:09,179
a demands it's going to spin the wire

396
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:11,100
while you know ongoing right it will

397
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:13,559
spin one and one and one it will never

398
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:16,860
end when we still have the notes in the

399
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:19,140
Q we get it out and we check if we have

400
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:20,820
seen the destination if we've seen it

401
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,740
with the tender distance otherwise we

402
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:25,200
pushes negative so this is the mutation

403
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:29,820
with each mutation is that we can pick

404
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:33,900
any one any finger Gene in a chain

405
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:37,679
string index I and then we can prove us

406
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:40,380
all other types acgt right this is HTT

407
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:43,140
and then we we check if not in the bank

408
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:46,020
and not in the scene okay so but here we

409
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:49,440
can make a small slide uh optimization

410
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:52,980
is that if this end this n could be the

411
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:56,160
same as the current right as you said

412
00:18:52,980 --> 00:19:00,120
if we do nothing is that a mutation

413
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:02,580
okay so here here less possibility let N

414
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:04,500
equal equal but it doesn't matter if we

415
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:06,299
don't check if it's an equal I'm still

416
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:09,000
okay because it's finding the certain

417
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:10,980
parts but we can avoid pushing this the

418
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,160
same current back to the cube by putting

419
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:15,539
another chip if uh and not equal the

420
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,700
current okay and then we'll push you

421
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:20,940
back okay and that's a very good point

422
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:22,980
okay that's it I'll be right because

423
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:25,740
then the B defines the way it moves yeah

424
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:28,740
the bank because everything pushed back

425
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:33,440
to the tube needs to be in the bank okay

426
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:33,440
and that's it for today bye bye bye
