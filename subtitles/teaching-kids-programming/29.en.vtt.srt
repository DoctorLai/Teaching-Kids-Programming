00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,110

hello

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:03,120

 

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,910

hello we just played the game on your

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:05,920
hello we just played the game on your
 

5
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:06,309
hello we just played the game on your
chest

6
00:00:06,309 --> 00:00:06,319
chest
 

7
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:08,310
chest
and we just knew what okay we're

8
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:08,320
and we just knew what okay we're
 

9
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,150
and we just knew what okay we're
learning about okay

10
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:10,160
learning about okay
 

11
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,470
learning about okay
okay okay

12
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:14,480
okay okay
 

13
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,700
okay okay
sit down

14
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:20,710

 

15
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:23,029

[Music]

16
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:23,039
[Music]
 

17
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,830
[Music]
good job okay so today we're going to

18
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:25,840
good job okay so today we're going to
 

19
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,109
good job okay so today we're going to
talk about

20
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:27,119
talk about
 

21
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,950
talk about
binary tree traversal binary tree

22
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:30,960
binary tree traversal binary tree
 

23
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,510
binary tree traversal binary tree
so what's binary two binary three

24
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:35,520
so what's binary two binary three
 

25
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,869
so what's binary two binary three
two three traversal traversal means the

26
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:38,879
two three traversal traversal means the
 

27
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:39,510
two three traversal traversal means the
the way

28
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:39,520
the way
 

29
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,030
the way
we we travel the tree with

30
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:43,040
we we travel the tree with
 

31
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,069
we we travel the tree with
the nose in a particular sequence right

32
00:00:46,069 --> 00:00:46,079
the nose in a particular sequence right
 

33
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,709
the nose in a particular sequence right
yeah so how many kind of finer tree

34
00:00:50,709 --> 00:00:50,719
yeah so how many kind of finer tree
 

35
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,110
yeah so how many kind of finer tree
do you know for example any examples

36
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:55,120
do you know for example any examples
 

37
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,590
do you know for example any examples
what kind of binary tree do you need

38
00:00:59,590 --> 00:00:59,600
what kind of binary tree do you need
 

39
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,750
what kind of binary tree do you need
yeah the left loads are always smaller

40
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:01,760
yeah the left loads are always smaller
 

41
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,830
yeah the left loads are always smaller
than the root the right notes are always

42
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:03,840
than the root the right notes are always
 

43
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,509
than the root the right notes are always
bigger than the root okay

44
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:05,519
bigger than the root okay
 

45
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,590
bigger than the root okay
so let's find a research tree and buy

46
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:07,600
so let's find a research tree and buy
 

47
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,590
so let's find a research tree and buy
another one

48
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:09,600
another one
 

49
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,990
another one
number two number it doesn't have to be

50
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:14,000
number two number it doesn't have to be
 

51
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,590
number two number it doesn't have to be
number one is the loot okay but we'll

52
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:15,600
number one is the loot okay but we'll
 

53
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,350
number one is the loot okay but we'll
talk about that later okay now

54
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:17,360
talk about that later okay now
 

55
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,149
talk about that later okay now
we call we talk about the traversal like

56
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:20,159
we call we talk about the traversal like
 

57
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,190
we call we talk about the traversal like
we have a route

58
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:21,200
we have a route
 

59
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,429
we have a route
one and then let's loot two here

60
00:01:25,429 --> 00:01:25,439
one and then let's loot two here
 

61
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,469
one and then let's loot two here
the leaf number three and then here

62
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:28,479
the leaf number three and then here
 

63
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,270
the leaf number three and then here
let's call let's let's design a tree

64
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:31,280
let's call let's let's design a tree
 

65
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,550
let's call let's let's design a tree
like that okay

66
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:32,560
like that okay
 

67
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,789
like that okay
one two three four five got it

68
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:36,799
one two three four five got it
 

69
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,469
one two three four five got it
uh so we we have uh

70
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:40,479
uh so we we have uh
 

71
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,350
uh so we we have uh
we we call it this node and we call it

72
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:43,360
we we call it this node and we call it
 

73
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:43,910
we we call it this node and we call it
left

74
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:43,920
left
 

75
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,190
left
left triad left three we call it l and

76
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:47,200
left triad left three we call it l and
 

77
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,389
left triad left three we call it l and
color right tree right if i i give a

78
00:01:50,389 --> 00:01:50,399
color right tree right if i i give a
 

79
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,630
color right tree right if i i give a
sequence like uh note

80
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:54,640
sequence like uh note
 

81
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,670
sequence like uh note
air left right yeah this is the

82
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:57,680
air left right yeah this is the
 

83
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,709
air left right yeah this is the
secret one four two five then

84
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:00,719
secret one four two five then
 

85
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,990
secret one four two five then
three exactly wow we're done it means

86
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:04,000
three exactly wow we're done it means
 

87
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,069
three exactly wow we're done it means
the pre-order so we reach it

88
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:06,079
the pre-order so we reach it
 

89
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,949
the pre-order so we reach it
for a tree we reach the node first and

90
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:08,959
for a tree we reach the node first and
 

91
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,150
for a tree we reach the node first and
then we recursively visit the left tree

92
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:12,160
then we recursively visit the left tree
 

93
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,150
then we recursively visit the left tree
and then visit the right tree so here

94
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:14,160
and then visit the right tree so here
 

95
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,070
and then visit the right tree so here
note is one i know which is the left

96
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:16,080
note is one i know which is the left
 

97
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:16,790
note is one i know which is the left
tree

98
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:16,800
tree
 

99
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,350
tree
which is two four five but for the two

100
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:19,360
which is two four five but for the two
 

101
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,190
which is two four five but for the two
four five three we again apply this

102
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:21,200
four five three we again apply this
 

103
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,550
four five three we again apply this
principle note

104
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:22,560
principle note
 

105
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,869
principle note
left and right which is two four five

106
00:02:24,869 --> 00:02:24,879
left and right which is two four five
 

107
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,790
left and right which is two four five
when we finish the left three then we go

108
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:26,800
when we finish the left three then we go
 

109
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,430
when we finish the left three then we go
to the

110
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:27,440
to the
 

111
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,670
to the
right tree which is three okay so let's

112
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:29,680
right tree which is three okay so let's
 

113
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,470
right tree which is three okay so let's
call it

114
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:30,480
call it
 

115
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,229
call it
pre-order yeah pre-order so this three

116
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:34,239
pre-order yeah pre-order so this three
 

117
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,869
pre-order yeah pre-order so this three
means the note here is squeeze beginning

118
00:02:36,869 --> 00:02:36,879
means the note here is squeeze beginning
 

119
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,229
means the note here is squeeze beginning
then if i move the end to the middle

120
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:40,239
then if i move the end to the middle
 

121
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,430
then if i move the end to the middle
and r we call it in order because this

122
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:43,440
and r we call it in order because this
 

123
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,270
and r we call it in order because this
end is in the middle in order so what

124
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:45,280
end is in the middle in order so what
 

125
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,949
end is in the middle in order so what
does it mean we visit the left tree

126
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:46,959
does it mean we visit the left tree
 

127
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:47,670
does it mean we visit the left tree
first

128
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:47,680
first
 

129
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,350
first
and then we reach the note and i'll

130
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:49,360
and then we reach the note and i'll
 

131
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,030
and then we reach the note and i'll
visit the right okay

132
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,040
visit the right okay
 

133
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,190
visit the right okay
so that would be 45 1 3

134
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:55,200
so that would be 45 1 3
 

135
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,750
so that would be 45 1 3
no no no no people find one three

136
00:02:59,750 --> 00:02:59,760
no no no no people find one three
 

137
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,229
no no no no people find one three
no no no left to first

138
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:04,239
no no no left to first
 

139
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,509
no no no left to first
for this this one left us is what four

140
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:07,519
for this this one left us is what four
 

141
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,710
for this this one left us is what four
three four two five

142
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:10,720
three four two five
 

143
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,990
three four two five
one three three what did you say

144
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,000
one three three what did you say
 

145
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,990
one three three what did you say
i said that okay okay sorry how did you

146
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,000
i said that okay okay sorry how did you
 

147
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,750
i said that okay okay sorry how did you
get here okay so let's let's

148
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:17,760
get here okay so let's let's
 

149
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,509
get here okay so let's let's
look at this one first and then one

150
00:03:19,509 --> 00:03:19,519
look at this one first and then one
 

151
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,110
look at this one first and then one
three but for this one we have to

152
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:21,120
three but for this one we have to
 

153
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,630
three but for this one we have to
recursively do it right

154
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:22,640
recursively do it right
 

155
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,229
recursively do it right
yeah so it will be uh so remind me it

156
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:26,239
yeah so it will be uh so remind me it
 

157
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:26,869
yeah so it will be uh so remind me it
will be

158
00:03:26,869 --> 00:03:26,879
will be
 

159
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,990
will be
four two five one three okay so let's

160
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:30,000
four two five one three okay so let's
 

161
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,670
four two five one three okay so let's
call it in order right

162
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:31,680
call it in order right
 

163
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,110
call it in order right
in order and how about if i move this to

164
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:35,120
in order and how about if i move this to
 

165
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,430
in order and how about if i move this to
the

166
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:35,440

00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:14,639
you know you see this is level by level
 

241
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,350
you know you see this is level by level
okay we talked about that before now we

242
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:17,360
okay we talked about that before now we
 

243
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,629
okay we talked about that before now we
let's let's do this

244
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:18,639
let's let's do this
 

245
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,909
let's let's do this
this should be very easy

246
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:21,919
this should be very easy
 

247
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,469

class
 

255
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,590
class
and then define in

256
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:33,600

 

257
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,070

right the loot and then left and right

right
yeah left and right yeah self dot dot

262
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,080
yeah left and right yeah self dot dot
 

263
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,350
yeah left and right yeah self dot dot
equals no self dot

264
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:41,360
equals no self dot
 

265
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,590
equals no self dot
left equals left f double y equals right

266
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:43,600
left equals left f double y equals right
 

267
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,029
left equals left f double y equals right
okay now

268
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:45,039
okay now
 

269
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,350
okay now
we we do this look define

270
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:49,360

 

271
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,670

in order let's take an example in order

272
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:51,680
in order let's take an example in order
 

273
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,950
in order let's take an example in order
okay

274
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:52,960
okay
 

275
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:58,950
okay
in order loot

276
00:05:58,950 --> 00:05:58,960

 

277
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,110

coma okay for the inorder so it's not

278
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:03,120
coma okay for the inorder so it's not
 

279
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,790
coma okay for the inorder so it's not
left note right right so we need to

280
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:06,800
left note right right so we need to
 

281
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,230
left note right right so we need to
we need to

282
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:10,240

 

283
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,710

so we first of all we need to do it if

284
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:12,720
so we first of all we need to do it if
 

285
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,510
so we first of all we need to do it if
the loser is

286
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:13,520
the loser is
 

287
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,830
the loser is
numb right if we lose it's numb then we

288
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:15,840
numb right if we lose it's numb then we
 

289
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,110
numb right if we lose it's numb then we
just return yeah

290
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,120
just return yeah
 

291
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,110
just return yeah
okay right and then we need to

292
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,120
okay right and then we need to
 

293
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,230
okay right and then we need to
reach it the left was that dog no it's

294
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:24,240
reach it the left was that dog no it's
 

295
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:24,710
reach it the left was that dog no it's
not

296

not
 

297
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,070
not
let's not we need to recursively visit

298
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,080
let's not we need to recursively visit
 

299
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,189
let's not we need to recursively visit
the left tree right right the left half

300
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:31,199
the left tree right right the left half
 

301
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,150
the left tree right right the left half
look here

302
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:32,160
look here
 

303
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,790
look here
so how do we do that in order

304
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:36,800
so how do we do that in order
 

305
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,950
so how do we do that in order
look top left okay so we look closely

306
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:40,960
look top left okay so we look closely
 

307
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,230
look top left okay so we look closely
recording the left

308
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:42,240
recording the left
 

309
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,590
recording the left
right and now we're visiting the loot

310
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:45,600
right and now we're visiting the loot
 

311
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,510
right and now we're visiting the loot
what we want to do is the loop we print

312
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:47,520
what we want to do is the loop we print
 

313
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:53,189
what we want to do is the loop we print
it okay let's print it

314
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:53,199

 

315
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,430

that's order right here
 

335
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,670
that's order right here
we will call yourself itself to because

336
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:37,680
we will call yourself itself to because
 

337
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,430
we will call yourself itself to because
that's that's okay with because if you

338
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:39,440
that's that's okay with because if you
 

339
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,270
that's that's okay with because if you
call it the right then when you finish

340
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:41,280
call it the right then when you finish
 

341
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:41,749
call it the right then when you finish
then

342
00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:41,759
then
 

343
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,150
then
you call this right yeah that's the

344
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:44,160
you call this right yeah that's the
 

345
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,990
you call this right yeah that's the
because recursion yeah you don't need to

346
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:46,000
because recursion yeah you don't need to
 

347
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,589
because recursion yeah you don't need to
worry about the details you will just

348
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:47,599
worry about the details you will just
 

349
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,110
worry about the details you will just
solving that

350
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:49,120
solving that
 

351
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,589
solving that
calling the in order with the right tree

352
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:51,599
calling the in order with the right tree
 

353
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:52,230
calling the in order with the right tree
right

354
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:52,240
right
 

355
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,749
right
to get it yeah okay so now

356
00:07:55,749 --> 00:07:55,759
to get it yeah okay so now
 

357
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,830
to get it yeah okay so now
if i want to change this to pre-order

358
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:57,840
if i want to change this to pre-order
 

359
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,990
if i want to change this to pre-order
how do you do it

360
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:00,000
how do you do it
 

361
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:08,469
how do you do it
remember pre-order

362
00:08:08,469 --> 00:08:08,479

 

363
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,189

you just need to change one thing ryan

364
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:11,199
you just need to change one thing ryan
 

365
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:16,629
you just need to change one thing ryan
do you know

366
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:16,639

 

367
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,430

yeah move the printing here yeah and how

368
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:19,440
yeah move the printing here yeah and how
 

369
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,189
yeah move the printing here yeah and how
about if i want to change this to

370
00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:21,199
about if i want to change this to
 

371
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,029
about if i want to change this to
close order

372
00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:25,039

 

373
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,070

do the first order again change

374
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,080
do the first order again change
 

375
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,190
do the first order again change
one thing

376
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:33,200

 

377
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,230

uh

378
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:36,240

 

379
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,310

put the print thingy at the bottom

380
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:40,320
put the print thingy at the bottom
 

381
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,230
put the print thingy at the bottom
yeah well done good job yeah that's

382
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:42,240
yeah well done good job yeah that's
 

383
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,750
yeah well done good job yeah that's
exactly do you see it

384
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:43,760
exactly do you see it
 

385
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,190
exactly do you see it
yeah so this is very clear right so

386
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:47,200
yeah so this is very clear right so
 

387
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,030
yeah so this is very clear right so
look again let's do this example one

388
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,040
look again let's do this example one
 

389
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,870
look again let's do this example one
two three four

390
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:54,880
two three four
 

391
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,190
two three four
five okay let's do like this in order

392
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:57,200
five okay let's do like this in order
 

393
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,710
five okay let's do like this in order
first okay in order so

394
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:58,720
first okay in order so
 

395
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,230
first okay in order so
in order if root is none it's not long

396
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:02,240
in order if root is none it's not long
 

397
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,350
in order if root is none it's not long
in order left yeah in order is left

398
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:05,360
in order left yeah in order is left
 

399
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,590
in order left yeah in order is left
okay when it's in order to finish then

400
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:07,600
okay when it's in order to finish then
 

401
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,550
okay when it's in order to finish then
put in the loot

402
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:08,560
put in the loot
 

403
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,350
put in the loot
which is one okay so that one is here

404
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:11,360
which is one okay so that one is here
 

405
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,150
which is one okay so that one is here
but in order

406
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:12,160
but in order
 

407
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,269
but in order
these will be we're printing one

408
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:15,279
these will be we're printing one
 

409
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,110
these will be we're printing one
we're printing yeah

410
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:19,120
we're printing yeah
 

411
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,269
we're printing yeah
left first yeah putting the left first

412
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:21,279
left first yeah putting the left first
 

413
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,269
left first yeah putting the left first
right so bringing four

414
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:23,279
right so bringing four
 

415
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,150
right so bringing four
to five right and then go back to the

416
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,160
to five right and then go back to the
 

417
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:26,470
to five right and then go back to the
one

418
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:26,480
one
 

419
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,389
one
and then you know the right that would

420
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:28,399
and then you know the right that would
 

421
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,750
and then you know the right that would
be three right

422
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:31,760

 

423
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,190

three yes yeah got it so

424
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:35,200
three yes yeah got it so
 

425
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,590
three yes yeah got it so
this is in order and how about if we do

426
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:37,600
this is in order and how about if we do
 

427
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,630
this is in order and how about if we do
like in order of

428
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:38,640
like in order of
 

429
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,949
like in order of
binary search tree that's the that's

430
00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:40,959
binary search tree that's the that's
 

431
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,630
binary search tree that's the that's
very interesting like

432
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:42,640
very interesting like
 

433
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,150
very interesting like
this is two this is one

434
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:46,160
this is two this is one
 

435
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,310
this is two this is one
this is three this is

436
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:50,320
this is three this is
 

437
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,350
this is three this is
this is four here and this is

438
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:55,360
this is four here and this is
 

439
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,870
this is four here and this is
zero okay so this is the binary circuit

440
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:58,880
zero okay so this is the binary circuit
 

441
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,590
zero okay so this is the binary circuit
yeah

442
00:09:59,590 --> 00:09:59,600
yeah
 

443
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,509
yeah
the left nodes are always smaller than

444
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:01,519
the left nodes are always smaller than
 

445
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,190
the left nodes are always smaller than
the root the right notes are always

446
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:03,200
the root the right notes are always
 

447
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,310
the root the right notes are always
bigger maybe i put

448
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:04,320
bigger maybe i put
 

449
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,269
bigger maybe i put
one more here that's 1.5 and that's

450
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:07,279
one more here that's 1.5 and that's
 

451
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:07,750
one more here that's 1.5 and that's
that's

452
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:07,760
that's
 

453
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,030
that's
2.5 so what

454
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,040
2.5 so what
 

455
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,470
2.5 so what
what if we do a binary in order of the

456
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:14,480
what if we do a binary in order of the
 

457
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,990
what if we do a binary in order of the
binary search tree

458
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,000
binary search tree
 

459
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,910
binary search tree
remember this is the left and now we

460
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:17,920
remember this is the left and now we
 

461
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,990
remember this is the left and now we
visit the loot and we visit the right so

462
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:20,000
visit the loot and we visit the right so
 

463
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,150
visit the loot and we visit the right so
what do you think what we can get

464
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:24,160

 

465
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,350

what do you think we can get so can you

466
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:27,360
what do you think we can get so can you
 

467
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,269
what do you think we can get so can you
do that in order of this financial

468
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:29,279
do that in order of this financial
 

469
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,230
do that in order of this financial

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,949
what do you think
that that is what do you think what do

502
00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:16,959
that that is what do you think what do
 

503
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:17,430
that that is what do you think what do
you think

504
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:17,440
you think
 

505
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,190
you think
what do you think this is uh

506
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:21,200
what do you think this is uh
 

507
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,910
what do you think this is uh
yeah this is in order yeah oh look the

508
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:23,920
yeah this is in order yeah oh look the
 

509
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,509
yeah this is in order yeah oh look the
name is in order but the

510
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:25,519
name is in order but the
 

511
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,310
name is in order but the
the result of performing and in order

512
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:28,320
the result of performing and in order
 

513
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,269
the result of performing and in order
traversal

514
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:29,279
traversal
 

515
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,910
traversal
on a binary search tree is that we get

516
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:31,920
on a binary search tree is that we get
 

517
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,509
on a binary search tree is that we get
the in order

518
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:33,519
the in order
 

519
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,230
the in order
element list right yeah from the

520
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:36,240
element list right yeah from the
 

521
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,829
element list right yeah from the
smallest to the largest

522
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:37,839
smallest to the largest
 

523
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,949
smallest to the largest
and how about if i want to

524
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:40,959
and how about if i want to
 

525
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,430
and how about if i want to
get from largest to the smallest what

526
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:43,440
get from largest to the smallest what
 

527
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,389
get from largest to the smallest what
should we do

528
00:11:44,389 --> 00:11:44,399
should we do
 

529
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,710
should we do
remember we talked about reverse in

530
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:46,720
remember we talked about reverse in
 

531
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,069
remember we talked about reverse in
order right

532
00:11:48,069 --> 00:11:48,079
order right
 

533
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,430
order right
so that would be r

534
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:51,440
so that would be r
 

535
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,389
so that would be r
and air right so then if we performing

536
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:54,399
and air right so then if we performing
 

537
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,230
and air right so then if we performing
the r in there reverse in order that we

538
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:56,240
the r in there reverse in order that we
 

539
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,350
the r in there reverse in order that we
have a four

540
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:57,360
have a four
 

541
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,470
have a four
three two point five two one point five

542
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:00,480
three two point five two one point five
 

543
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,550
three two point five two one point five
one zero okay yeah two point one

544
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:04,560
one zero okay yeah two point one
 

545
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,750
one zero okay yeah two point one
two two yeah two one one okay so

546
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:07,760
two two yeah two one one okay so
 

547
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,829
two two yeah two one one okay so
for these all these trevor sir what's

548
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:09,839
for these all these trevor sir what's
 

549
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,509
for these all these trevor sir what's
the complexity

550
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:11,519
the complexity
 

551
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,550
the complexity
what's the time complexity of

552
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:16,560

 

553
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,069

the what the end yeah

554
00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:20,079
the what the end yeah
 

555
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:26,320
the what the end yeah
yes oh oh yeah yeah why is

556
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:26,330

 

557
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,230

[Music]

558
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:28,240
[Music]
 

559
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,949
[Music]
we have to visit every node in a tree

560
00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:30,959
we have to visit every node in a tree
 

561
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:31,590
we have to visit every node in a tree
that's why

562
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:31,600
that's why
 

563
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,069
that's why
the travelers are different servers they

564
00:12:34,069 --> 00:12:34,079
the travelers are different servers they
 

565
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:34,629
the travelers are different servers they
are all

566
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:34,639
are all
 

567
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,430
are all
open right they are all already okay the

568
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:37,440
open right they are all already okay the
 

569
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,110
open right they are all already okay the
time complexity okay

570
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:39,120
time complexity okay
 

571
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,750
time complexity okay
for the space complexity is also om

572
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:41,760
for the space complexity is also om
 

573
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,190
for the space complexity is also om
because we are using this

574
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:43,200
because we are using this
 

575
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,069
because we are using this
we we don't have uh we don't allocate

576
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:46,079
we we don't have uh we don't allocate
 

577
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:46,629
we we don't have uh we don't allocate
the space

578
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:46,639
the space
 

579
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,150
the space
particularly but we are using the

580
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:48,160
particularly but we are using the
 

581
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,990
particularly but we are using the
recursion recursion

582
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:50,000
recursion recursion
 

583
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,710
recursion recursion
cost of n right there's a calling stack

584
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:52,720
cost of n right there's a calling stack
 

585
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,110
cost of n right there's a calling stack
okay you don't have to remember

586
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:55,120
okay you don't have to remember
 

587
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,030
okay you don't have to remember
understand now but it's good to know

588
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:57,040
understand now but it's good to know
 

589
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,710
understand now but it's good to know
that the space complexity

590
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:58,720
that the space complexity
 

591
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,750
that the space complexity
for the recursion usually is o n okay

592
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:03,760

 

593
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,829

okay thank you that's that's it today

594
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:05,839
okay thank you that's that's it today
 

595
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,829
okay thank you that's that's it today
good job

596
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:07,839
good job
 

597
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,350
