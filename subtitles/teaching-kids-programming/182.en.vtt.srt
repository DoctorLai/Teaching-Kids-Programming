3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,870

okay so today we talk about

4
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:10,880
okay so today we talk about
 

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,070
okay so today we talk about
the numbers again so we we're given a

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:14,080
the numbers again so we we're given a
 

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,950
the numbers again so we we're given a
list of numbers about target yeah we're

8
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:16,960
list of numbers about target yeah we're
 

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,109
list of numbers about target yeah we're
given a list of numbers we want to find

10
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:19,119
given a list of numbers we want to find
 

11
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:19,830
given a list of numbers we want to find
out the

12
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:19,840
out the
 

13
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,750
out the
sum of any two numbers that

14
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:23,760
sum of any two numbers that
 

15
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,070
sum of any two numbers that
that is bigger than the target but it's

16
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:26,080
that is bigger than the target but it's
 

17
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,109
that is bigger than the target but it's
the lowest

18
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:27,119
the lowest
 

19
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,150
the lowest
but has the lowest one like this one i

20
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:30,160
but has the lowest one like this one i
 

21
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:30,550
but has the lowest one like this one i
think

22
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:30,560
think
 

23
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,069
think
three three five seven

24
00:00:34,069 --> 00:00:34,079
three three five seven
 

25
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,510
three three five seven
nine seven nine ten

26
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:37,520
nine seven nine ten
 

27
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,670
nine seven nine ten
no no no no no okay that's it once

28
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:39,680
no no no no no okay that's it once
 

29
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,510
no no no no no okay that's it once
you're eleven

30
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:41,520
you're eleven
 

31
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,950
you're eleven
okay i need eleven and the target is

32
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:44,960
okay i need eleven and the target is
 

33
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,590
okay i need eleven and the target is
let's say the top is eight so can you

34
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:47,600
let's say the top is eight so can you
 

35
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,549
let's say the top is eight so can you
find two numbers

36
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:48,559
find two numbers
 

37
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,750
find two numbers
that the sum of these are

38
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:51,760
that the sum of these are
 

39
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,750
that the sum of these are
bigger than eight but it's the smallest

40
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:53,760
bigger than eight but it's the smallest
 

41
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,430
bigger than eight but it's the smallest
remember we we we have a

42
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:55,440
remember we we we have a
 

43
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,630
remember we we we have a
three five sorry three and five

44
00:00:58,630 --> 00:00:58,640
three five sorry three and five
 

45
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,189
three five sorry three and five
they're strictly bigger than that how

46
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:01,199
they're strictly bigger than that how
 

47
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,709
they're strictly bigger than that how
many numbers can we use

48
00:01:02,709 --> 00:01:02,719
many numbers can we use
 

49
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,710
many numbers can we use
two numbers remember previously we have

50
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:04,720
two numbers remember previously we have
 

51
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,149
two numbers remember previously we have
these kind of similar questions

52
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:06,159
these kind of similar questions
 

53
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,469
these kind of similar questions
finding two numbers let's some less than

54
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:08,479
finding two numbers let's some less than
 

55
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,230
finding two numbers let's some less than
the target but the largest

56
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:12,240
the target but the largest
 

57
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,630
the target but the largest
three and seven three and seven are one

58
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:14,640
three and seven three and seven are one
 

59
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,510
three and seven three and seven are one
and nine

60
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:15,520
and nine
 

61
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,510
and nine
yeah three and seven or one and nine

62
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:17,520
yeah three and seven or one and nine
 

63
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,630
yeah three and seven or one and nine
yeah we're done

64
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:18,640
yeah we're done
 

65
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,710
yeah we're done
because one plus one plus nine is ten

66
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:22,720
because one plus one plus nine is ten
 

67
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,950
because one plus one plus nine is ten
three plus seven is ten it's bigger than

68
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:24,960
three plus seven is ten it's bigger than
 

69
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,710
three plus seven is ten it's bigger than
a but it's the smallest yeah you can't

70
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:26,720
a but it's the smallest yeah you can't
 

71
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,429
a but it's the smallest yeah you can't
find

72
00:01:27,429 --> 00:01:27,439
find
 

73
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,230
find
any numbers two numbers the sum are

00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:30,240
any numbers two numbers the sum are
 

75
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,030

bigger than a
 

77
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,030
bigger than a
but it's the smallest right smallest

78
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:33,040
but it's the smallest right smallest
 

79
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,870
but it's the smallest right smallest
than 10 am right

than 10 am right
 

81
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,270
than 10 am right
how can we do it remember similarly

82
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:37,280
how can we do it remember similarly
 

83
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,630
how can we do it remember similarly
previously we talked about

84
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:38,640
previously we talked about
 

85
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,469
previously we talked about
sum of any two numbers that is smaller

86
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:42,479
sum of any two numbers that is smaller
 

87
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,950
sum of any two numbers that is smaller
that is smaller than the target and we

88
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:44,960
that is smaller than the target and we
 

89
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,990
that is smaller than the target and we
want to find the

90
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,000
want to find the
 

91
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,149
want to find the
largest now this is opposite we want to

92
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:48,159
largest now this is opposite we want to
 

93
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,389
largest now this is opposite we want to
find the lowest sum which is bigger than

94
00:01:50,389 --> 00:01:50,399
find the lowest sum which is bigger than
 

95
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,069
find the lowest sum which is bigger than

largest sum which is small
 

101
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,310
largest sum which is small
yeah okay so it's the same so can you

102
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:58,320
yeah okay so it's the same so can you
 

103
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,590
yeah okay so it's the same so can you
remind me how we're doing this

104
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:01,600
remind me how we're doing this
 

105
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,069
remind me how we're doing this
if you're not sure we can always pay for

106
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:04,079
if you're not sure we can always pay for
 

107
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:04,709
if you're not sure we can always pay for
us

108
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:04,719
us
 

109
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,510
us
okay so what kind of how can we put a

110
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:07,520
okay so what kind of how can we put a
 

111
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,949
okay so what kind of how can we put a
force

112
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:08,959
force
 

113
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,430
force
for us any pairs and if there are n

114
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:11,440
for us any pairs and if there are n
 

115
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,510
for us any pairs and if there are n
numbers what's the term complexity to

116
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:13,520
numbers what's the term complexity to
 

117
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,309
numbers what's the term complexity to
prove first thing the the pairs of two

118
00:02:16,309 --> 00:02:16,319
prove first thing the the pairs of two
 

119
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:16,949
prove first thing the the pairs of two
uh

120
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:16,959
uh
 

121
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,390
uh
l square oh n square okay so we can find

122
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:20,400
l square oh n square okay so we can find
 

123
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,550
l square oh n square okay so we can find
any two number we sum up and if it's

124
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:22,560
any two number we sum up and if it's
 

125
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:22,949
any two number we sum up and if it's
that

126
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:22,959
that
 

127
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,550
that
if it's bigger than target we'll find a

128
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:24,560
if it's bigger than target we'll find a
 

129
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,710
if it's bigger than target we'll find a
minimum of it right

130
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:26,720
minimum of it right
 

131
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,750
minimum of it right
what okay let's do this

132
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:29,760
what okay let's do this
 

133
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,270

come on feel the blanks

174
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:19,040

 

175
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,590

i'll do this one of course that's easy

176
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:21,600
i'll do this one of course that's easy
 

177
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,469
i'll do this one of course that's easy
and then how about you

178
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:22,479
and then how about you
 

179
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:30,230
and then how about you
do that once no no police

180
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:30,240

 

181
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,390

if this sum is bigger than the target

182
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:32,400
if this sum is bigger than the target
 

183
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,310
if this sum is bigger than the target
and then we want to find the minimum

184
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:34,320
and then we want to find the minimum
 

185
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,350
and then we want to find the minimum
yeah max also

186
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:37,360
yeah max also
 

187
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:56,390
yeah max also
equals max minimum no max

188
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:56,400

 

189
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,790

yeah yeah be confident okay you can do

190
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:58,800
yeah yeah be confident okay you can do
 

191
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,350
yeah yeah be confident okay you can do

it you see
 

193
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,310
it you see
what's going on now all right all right

194
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:04,320
what's going on now all right all right
 

195
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:04,950
what's going on now all right all right
come on

196
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:04,960
come on

zero to n minus one the index j

204
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:26,960
zero to n minus one the index j
 

205
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,270
zero to n minus one the index j
it starts from zero to i minus one okay

206
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:29,280
it starts from zero to i minus one okay
 

207
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,270
it starts from zero to i minus one okay
got it

208
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:33,280

 

209
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,029

yes that's mine can we do better

210
00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:37,039
yes that's mine can we do better
 

211
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,189
yes that's mine can we do better
maybe we can

212
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:41,199

 

213
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,670

previously how can we solve this problem

214
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:43,680

how can we solve this problem
 

217
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,230
how can we solve this problem
okay look at 1 3 5 7

218
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:50,240
okay look at 1 3 5 7
 

219
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,350
okay look at 1 3 5 7
9 10 eleven we want to find a cup of tea

220
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:53,360
9 10 eleven we want to find a cup of tea
 

221
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,270
9 10 eleven we want to find a cup of tea
okay okay so if this number is not salty

222
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:57,280
okay okay so if this number is not salty
 

223
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,710
okay okay so if this number is not salty
we sort it so and then we can use one

224
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:00,720
we sort it so and then we can use one
 

225
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,749
we sort it so and then we can use one
we can use one what's the t point there

226
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:03,759
we can use one what's the t point there
 

227
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,749
we can use one what's the t point there
yeah and how can we apply the two points

228
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:05,759
yeah and how can we apply the two points
 

229
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,510
yeah and how can we apply the two points
okay if this left this is

230
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:07,520
okay if this left this is
 

231
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,350
okay if this left this is
right we need to sort it first yeah

232
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:09,360
right we need to sort it first yeah
 

233
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,110
right we need to sort it first yeah
salty first okay what's the some

234
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:11,120
salty first okay what's the some
 

235
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,550
salty first okay what's the some
complexity to solve

236
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:12,560
complexity to solve
 

237
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,950
complexity to solve
again okay so left and right what's the

238
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:14,960
again okay so left and right what's the
 

239
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,309
again okay so left and right what's the
sum of numbers

240
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:16,319
sum of numbers
 

241
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,629
sum of numbers
and it's 12 and so 12.

242
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:20,639
and it's 12 and so 12.
 

243
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,270
and it's 12 and so 12.
okay that's good and then so we try to

244
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:23,280
okay that's good and then so we try to
 

245
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,710
okay that's good and then so we try to
make it smaller

246
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:24,720
make it smaller
 

247
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,110
make it smaller
to see if we can improve our score they

248
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:27,120
to see if we can improve our score they
 

249
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,309
to see if we can improve our score they
move it right

250
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:28,319
move it right
 

251
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,430
move it right
we're done what's your space what was

252
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:31,440
we're done what's your space what was
 

253
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,150
we're done what's your space what was
the sum 11 i know we improve and

254
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:34,160
the sum 11 i know we improve and
 

255
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,309
the sum 11 i know we improve and
we move we have to keep moving that's

256
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:36,319
we move we have to keep moving that's
 

257
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,550
we move we have to keep moving that's
ten

258
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:38,560

 

259
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,070

yeah yeah hey okay i know what happened

260
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:42,080
yeah yeah hey okay i know what happened
 

261
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,710
yeah yeah hey okay i know what happened
no it can't right now and then we have

262
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:44,720
no it can't right now and then we have
 

263
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,830
no it can't right now and then we have
to move the leg

264
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:45,840
to move the leg
 

265
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,390
to move the leg
well down wow are getting there and

266
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:48,400
well down wow are getting there and
 

267
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,270
well down wow are getting there and
seven seven

268
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:49,280
seven seven
 

269
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,790
seven seven
is ten and we can improve

270
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:52,800
is ten and we can improve
 

271
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,909
is ten and we can improve
then we move the left or right uh

272
00:06:55,909 --> 00:06:55,919
then we move the left or right uh
 

273
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,430
then we move the left or right uh
left right right yeah okay that's it

274
00:06:59,430 --> 00:06:59,440
left right right yeah okay that's it
 

275
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,950
left right right yeah okay that's it
what do i need okay good

276
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:02,960
what do i need okay good
 

277
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,110
what do i need okay good
two-pointer it's the same thing as the

278
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:05,120
two-pointer it's the same thing as the
 

279
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,790
two-pointer it's the same thing as the
finding the largest that

280
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:06,800
finding the largest that
 

281
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,550
finding the largest that
are smaller than the target right this

282
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:08,560
are smaller than the target right this
 

283
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,309
are smaller than the target right this
is basically opposite right

284
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:10,319
is basically opposite right
 

285
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,309
is basically opposite right
yeah this is a very good review okay

286
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:14,319
yeah this is a very good review okay
 

287
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,710
yeah this is a very good review okay
uh so first of all how can we solve

288
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:16,720
uh so first of all how can we solve
 

289
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:23,510
uh so first of all how can we solve
these numbers

290
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:23,520

 

291
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,550

break it okay and

292
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:26,560
break it okay and
 

293
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:36,230
break it okay and
left right left right equals

294
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:36,240

 

295
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,230

minus one okay

296
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:40,240

 

297
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,670

why the left and right no meat right

298
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:43,680
why the left and right no meat right
 

299
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,869
why the left and right no meat right
yeah all right and caroline

300
00:07:46,869 --> 00:07:46,879
yeah all right and caroline
 

301
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,469
yeah all right and caroline
equals what

302
00:07:50,469 --> 00:07:50,479

 

303
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,629

numbs left plus one that's right

304
00:07:54,629 --> 00:07:54,639
numbs left plus one that's right
 

305
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,990
numbs left plus one that's right
yeah okay if

306
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:58,000
yeah okay if
 

307
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,029
yeah okay if
current bigger than target i have an

308
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:01,039
current bigger than target i have an
 

309
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:01,510
current bigger than target i have an
answer

310
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:01,520
answer
 

311
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,629
answer
on the equal minion answer this year we

312
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:04,639
on the equal minion answer this year we
 

313
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:10,830
on the equal minion answer this year we
forgot yeah i'm current what answer

314
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:10,840

 

315
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,230

is

316
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:12,240
is
 

317
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,430
is
we want to find the minimum yeah and now

318
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:15,440
we want to find the minimum yeah and now
 

319
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,110
we want to find the minimum yeah and now
and then here what should we do and

320
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:17,120
and then here what should we do and
 

321
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,869
and then here what should we do and
write minus one

322
00:08:18,869 --> 00:08:18,879
write minus one
 

323
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,990
write minus one
and i have minus equal one else left

324
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:22,000
and i have minus equal one else left
 

325
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,589
and i have minus equal one else left
equals

326
00:08:23,589 --> 00:08:23,599
equals
 

327
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:28,469
equals
one that's equal one return answer

328
00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:28,479

 

329
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,630

answer what's the time complexity

330
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:32,640

 

331
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,110

what's the time complexity this is one

332
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:35,120
what's the time complexity this is one
 

333
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,949
what's the time complexity this is one
this is what this

334
00:08:38,949 --> 00:08:38,959

 

335
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,469

i want to sound is on this one yeah and

336
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:42,479
i want to sound is on this one yeah and
 

337
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,149
i want to sound is on this one yeah and
