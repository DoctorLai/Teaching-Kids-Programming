so do you still remember if we're given
 

29
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,150
so do you still remember if we're given
a string or a list

a string or a list
 

31
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,469
a string or a list
yeah a string or this how do we check if

32
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:04,479
yeah a string or this how do we check if
 

33
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:05,189
yeah a string or this how do we check if
it's a pairing

remember how do we check if a list
 

37
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,070
remember how do we check if a list
at least or a string

38

39
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,350

at least or we call it a rare how do we

00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:25,680
reversal well yeah one way we reverse it
 

47
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,310
reversal well yeah one way we reverse it
so

48
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:26,320
so
 

49
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,429
so
how if we if we s is the b or string how

50
00:01:29,429 --> 00:01:29,439
how if we if we s is the b or string how
 

51
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,310
how if we if we s is the b or string how
can we check

52
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:30,320
can we check
 

53
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,910
can we check
return reverse it

54
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:33,920

 

55
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,830

s equals how compliment reverse this bit

56
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:38,840

 

57
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,429

um yeah this is the one

58
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:41,439
um yeah this is the one
 

59
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,590
um yeah this is the one
poison way to do it and another approach

60
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:43,600
poison way to do it and another approach
 

61
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,950
poison way to do it and another approach
is what how do we do it

62
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:46,960

 

63
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,389

um how do you look look at my hand

64
00:01:50,389 --> 00:01:50,399
um how do you look look at my hand
 

65
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:58,709
um how do you look look at my hand
look at my hand

66
00:01:58,709 --> 00:01:58,719

 

67
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,550

j equals the length yeah the length

68
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:00,560
j equals the length yeah the length
 

69
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,870
j equals the length yeah the length
minus one okay why are

70
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:02,880
minus one okay why are
 

71
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,230
minus one okay why are
i smaller than j right if

72
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:06,240
i smaller than j right if
 

73
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,110
i smaller than j right if
s i not equals as j

74
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:11,120

 

75
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,550

return y

76
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:14,560

 

77
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,030

plus plus and then i plus equals one j

78
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:19,040
plus plus and then i plus equals one j
 

79
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,030
plus plus and then i plus equals one j
minus equals one right that's the two

80
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:21,040
minus equals one right that's the two
 

81
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,309
minus equals one right that's the two
points i think yeah

82
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:22,319
points i think yeah
 

83
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,430
points i think yeah
correct yeah actually there's another

84
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:25,440
correct yeah actually there's another
 

85
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,390
correct yeah actually there's another
way third way

86
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:26,400
way third way
 

87
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,630
way third way
is that if we calculate the index how

88
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:28,640
is that if we calculate the index how
 

89
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,510
is that if we calculate the index how
many ways

90
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:29,520
many ways
 

91
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,150
many ways
are they quite a lot but this is the

92
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:32,160
are they quite a lot but this is the
 

93
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,390
are they quite a lot but this is the
most typical three one okay so look

94
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:34,400
most typical three one okay so look
 

95
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,910
most typical three one okay so look
look if this index is zero

96
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:37,920
look if this index is zero
 

97
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,470
look if this index is zero
what's the opposite in at the other hand

98
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:40,480
what's the opposite in at the other hand
 

99
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:40,949
what's the opposite in at the other hand
if this

100
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:40,959
if this
 

101
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,550
if this
is how many characters is it two four

102
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:44,560
is how many characters is it two four
 

103
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,869
is how many characters is it two four
six seven seven characters if this is

104
00:02:46,869 --> 00:02:46,879
six seven seven characters if this is
 

105
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:47,990
six seven seven characters if this is
zero what's

106
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:48,000
zero what's
 

107
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,350
zero what's
this index

108
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:51,360
this index
 

109
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,229
this index
seven minus one minus zero okay if it's

110
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:54,239
seven minus one minus zero okay if it's
 

111
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:54,710
seven minus one minus zero okay if it's
one

112
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:54,720
one
 

113
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,550
one
what's this index seven minus one minus

114
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:58,560
what's this index seven minus one minus
 

115
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,589
what's this index seven minus one minus
one one yeah if this is two

116
00:03:01,589 --> 00:03:01,599
one one yeah if this is two
 

117
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,350
one one yeah if this is two
what's the mean that's seven minus one

118
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:03,360
what's the mean that's seven minus one
 

119
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,110
what's the mean that's seven minus one
minus t yeah that's it

120
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:05,120
minus t yeah that's it
 

121
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,869
minus t yeah that's it
so we just compare i index i

122
00:03:08,869 --> 00:03:08,879
so we just compare i index i
 

123
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:13,110
so we just compare i index i
with with what n minus one minus i

124
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:13,120
with with what n minus one minus i
 

125
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,670
with with what n minus one minus i
okay and we just compare these right

126
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:15,680
okay and we just compare these right
 

127
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,790
okay and we just compare these right
until the meter

128
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:16,800
until the meter
 

129
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,190
until the meter
yeah we just can we just need to con

130
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:19,200
yeah we just can we just need to con
 

131
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,550
yeah we just can we just need to con
from i from zero

132
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:20,560
from i from zero
 

133
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,910
from i from zero
to n divided by two yeah

134
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:23,920
to n divided by two yeah
 

135
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,589
to n divided by two yeah
we just need to go into the middle yeah

136
00:03:25,589 --> 00:03:25,599
we just need to go into the middle yeah
 

137
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,190
we just need to go into the middle yeah
we don't need to go further right i'm

right
 

141
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,270
right
correct yeah okay so you understand

142
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:31,280
correct yeah okay so you understand
 

143
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,190
correct yeah okay so you understand
this complexity is all o n right okay

144
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:35,200
this complexity is all o n right okay
 

145
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,390
this complexity is all o n right okay
so how about the linked list we want to

146
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:38,400
so how about the linked list we want to
 

147
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,350
so how about the linked list we want to
check if a parent

148
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:39,360
check if a parent
 

149
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,350
check if a parent
is a penguin is in english what's the

150
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:41,360
is a penguin is in english what's the
 

151
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,190
is a penguin is in english what's the
difference here all right

152
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:43,200
difference here all right
 

153
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,270
difference here all right
what's the difference even list and

154
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:47,280
what's the difference even list and
 

155
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,550
what's the difference even list and
what's the list what's the difference

156
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:48,560
what's the list what's the difference
 

157
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,430
what's the list what's the difference
between this and a link list

158
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:51,440
between this and a link list
 

159
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,190
between this and a link list
list link list a link list

160
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:55,200
list link list a link list
 

161
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,070
list link list a link list
has numbers in circles

162
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,080
has numbers in circles
 

163
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,589
has numbers in circles
let's visu vivid visual yeah

164
00:04:03,589 --> 00:04:03,599
let's visu vivid visual yeah
 

165
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,149
let's visu vivid visual yeah
that's how we visualize it right and

166
00:04:08,149 --> 00:04:08,159

 

167
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,830

and connect it by line connected

168
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:11,840
and connect it by line connected
 

169
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,470
and connect it by line connected
okay so listen look at this is list one

170
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:14,480
okay so listen look at this is list one
 

171
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:14,949
okay so listen look at this is list one
two

172
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:14,959
two
 

173
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,270
two
three four right this is the list and

174
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:17,280
three four right this is the list and
 

175
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,390
three four right this is the list and
the link list is

176
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:18,400
the link list is
 

177
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,069
the link list is
one point point two point two three

178
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:22,079
one point point two point two three
 

179
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,110
one point point two point two three
point four okay so this is how we

180
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:25,120
point four okay so this is how we
 

181
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,230
point four okay so this is how we
represent it uh

182
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:26,240
represent it uh
 

183
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,909
represent it uh
visually the list is that the memory

184
00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:29,919
visually the list is that the memory
 

185
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,950
visually the list is that the memory
is the continuous right so this is

186
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:32,960
is the continuous right so this is
 

187
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,670
is the continuous right so this is

188
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:33,680
comments
 

189
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,710
comments
this is this is continuous so in memory

190
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:36,720
this is this is continuous so in memory
 

191
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,990
this is this is continuous so in memory
in memory you'll be just like that

192
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:40,000
in memory you'll be just like that
 

193
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,710
in memory you'll be just like that
these are together one two three four

194
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:42,720
these are together one two three four
 

195
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,670
these are together one two three four
right so it's

196
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:43,680
right so it's
 

197
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,550
right so it's
it's it's continuous if we know that no

198
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:46,560
it's it's continuous if we know that no
 

199
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,070
it's it's continuous if we know that no
if we know this

200
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:48,080
if we know this
 

201
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,030
if we know this
position of the one array we can

202
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:51,040
position of the one array we can
 

203
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,909
position of the one array we can
calculate two

204
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:51,919
calculate two
 

205
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,909
calculate two
and three and four that the computer

206
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:53,919
and three and four that the computer
 

207
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:54,950
and three and four that the computer
knows how to get the

208
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:54,960
knows how to get the
 

209
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,950
knows how to get the
value of two three four yeah it means

210
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:56,960
value of two three four yeah it means
 

211
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,629
value of two three four yeah it means
that access is one

212
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:00,639

 

213
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,110

or one complexity but for this one it's

214
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:03,120
or one complexity but for this one it's
 

215
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,790
or one complexity but for this one it's
not right i mean look

216
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:04,800
not right i mean look
 

217
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,390
not right i mean look
the one two one and two are not

218
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:08,400
the one two one and two are not
 

219
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,310
the one two one and two are not
it could be you know it could be

220
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:10,320
it could be you know it could be
 

221
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,830
it could be you know it could be
different right so it could be at

222
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:11,840
different right so it could be at
 

223
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,110
different right so it could be at
different positions so it could be

224
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:13,120
different positions so it could be
 

225
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,469
different positions so it could be
somewhere else come

226
00:05:14,469 --> 00:05:14,479
somewhere else come
 

227
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,950
somewhere else come
somewhere else somewhere else right it

228
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:16,960
somewhere else somewhere else right it
 

229
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,830
somewhere else somewhere else right it
could be

230
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:19,840

 

231
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,510

ho ho it could be uh what's the sparsely

232
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:23,520
ho ho it could be uh what's the sparsely
 

233
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,629
ho ho it could be uh what's the sparsely
sparsely

234
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:24,639
sparsely
 

235
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,110
sparsely
allocated different way right this could

236
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:27,120
allocated different way right this could
 

237
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,189
allocated different way right this could
be as

238
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:29,199
be as
 

239
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,270
be as
yeah all right so how how do you

240
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:31,280
yeah all right so how how do you
 

241
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,950
yeah all right so how how do you
represent me for easy

242
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:32,960
represent me for easy
 

243
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,310
represent me for easy
yeah yeah no no you could be fine so

244
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:36,320
yeah yeah no no you could be fine so
 

245
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,189
yeah yeah no no you could be fine so
so at each note you will be your value

246
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:39,199
so at each note you will be your value
 

247
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,550
so at each note you will be your value
and then you will be your next

248
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:40,560
and then you will be your next
 

249
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,270
and then you will be your next
all right next so what we need over here

250
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:43,280
all right next so what we need over here
 

251
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,870
all right next so what we need over here
to start the next position

252
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:44,880
to start the next position
 

253
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,029
to start the next position
right am right that's the pointer to the

254
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:47,039
right am right that's the pointer to the
 

255
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,469
right am right that's the pointer to the
next okay

256
00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:48,479
next okay
 

257
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,909
next okay
so this one you before you will be only

258
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:51,919
so this one you before you will be only
 

259
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,110
so this one you before you will be only
storing

260
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:53,120
storing
 

261
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,590
storing
four values right but this one we will

262
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:55,600
four values right but this one we will
 

263
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,830
four values right but this one we will
need additional next pointer to point to

264
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:57,840
need additional next pointer to point to
 

265
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,749
need additional next pointer to point to
next why because the next one

266
00:05:59,749 --> 00:05:59,759
next why because the next one
 

267
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,629
next why because the next one
is not on its next it could be somewhere

268
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:02,639
is not on its next it could be somewhere
 

269
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,430
is not on its next it could be somewhere
else

270
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:03,440
else
 

271
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,749
else
so so what does it mean if we want to

272
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:05,759
so so what does it mean if we want to
 

273
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,830
so so what does it mean if we want to
get the value of three

274
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:07,840
get the value of three
 

275
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,230
get the value of three
we don't know yet we need to traverse

276
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:10,240
we don't know yet we need to traverse
 

277
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,510
we don't know yet we need to traverse
from the beginning

278
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:11,520
from the beginning
 

279
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,670
from the beginning
yeah followed by the one to the two to

280
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:13,680
yeah followed by the one to the two to
 

281
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,350
yeah followed by the one to the two to
the three so what does it mean what's

282
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:15,360
the three so what does it mean what's
 

283
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,430
the three so what does it mean what's
the term complexity of getting

284
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:17,440
the term complexity of getting
 

285
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,710
the term complexity of getting
number three

286
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:20,720

 

287
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,909

because we need to travel from the

288
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:21,919
because we need to travel from the
 

289
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,990
because we need to travel from the
beginning yeah yeah

290
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,000
beginning yeah yeah
 

291
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,790
beginning yeah yeah
well that's the difference here i didn't

292
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:26,800
well that's the difference here i didn't
 

293
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,550
well that's the difference here i didn't
i just touched your leaves okay

294
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:28,560
i just touched your leaves okay
 

295
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,909
i just touched your leaves okay
so what do you think yeah so

296
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:31,919
so what do you think yeah so
 

297
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,629
so what do you think yeah so
how is that different i mean so we can't

298
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:34,639
how is that different i mean so we can't
 

299
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,950
how is that different i mean so we can't
can we apply the equilibrium

300
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:36,960
can we apply the equilibrium
 

301
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,070
can we apply the equilibrium
the previous aggregate all right

302
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,080
the previous aggregate all right
 

303
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,390
the previous aggregate all right
can we apply the previous algorithm

304
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:42,400
can we apply the previous algorithm
 

305
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,070
can we apply the previous algorithm
maybe we can

306
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,080
maybe we can
 

307
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,749
maybe we can
the two pointer we can't right because

308
00:06:45,749 --> 00:06:45,759
the two pointer we can't right because
 

309
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,270
the two pointer we can't right because
we only know

310
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:47,280
we only know
 

311
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,350
we only know
hey we only know the beginning here we

312
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:49,360
hey we only know the beginning here we
 

313
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,550
hey we only know the beginning here we
we are not

314
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:50,560
we are not
 

315
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,629
we are not
for example the two pointer thing yeah

316
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:52,639
for example the two pointer thing yeah
 

317
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:53,749
for example the two pointer thing yeah
two points i think we

318
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:53,759
two points i think we
 

319
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,629
two points i think we
we don't know the end right all right

320
00:06:56,629 --> 00:06:56,639
we don't know the end right all right
 

321
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,629
we don't know the end right all right
and each note only points to the next it

322
00:06:58,629 --> 00:06:58,639
and each note only points to the next it
 

323
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,070
and each note only points to the next it
doesn't point to the previous right

324
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:00,080
doesn't point to the previous right
 

325
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:00,790
doesn't point to the previous right
right unless

326
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:00,800
right unless
 

327
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,510
right unless
it's a two directional pointer yeah

328
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:03,520
it's a two directional pointer yeah
 

329
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,189
it's a two directional pointer yeah
two-dimensional increase so

330
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:05,199
two-dimensional increase so
 

331
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,309
two-dimensional increase so
meaning this way right all right can you

332
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:08,319
meaning this way right all right can you
 

333
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,029
meaning this way right all right can you
listen to me

334
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:09,039
listen to me
 

335
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,670
listen to me
oh yeah okay so can you repeat what i

336

it's like it can it can go

yeah so yeah so for the two pointer we

yeah so yeah so for the two pointer we
 

347
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,589
yeah so yeah so for the two pointer we
only

only
 

349
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,350

we need to know the beginning and the

00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:29,360
we need to know the beginning and the
 

351
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,790
we need to know the beginning and the

352
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:30,800
end and also
 

353
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,390

in order for the two pointers to work

354
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:32,400
in order for the two pointers to work

363
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,510

next one
 

365
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,029
next one
right it doesn't point to the previous

366
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:43,039
right it doesn't point to the previous
 

367
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,749

the value i can i know
 

527
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,310
the value i can i know
already know the value and then i'm i'm

okay let's say we're converting these

okay let's say we're converting these
we're converting that node to the data

we're converting that node to the data
 

579
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,990
we're converting that node to the data

come on if i ask you the space check for

00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:35,760
come on if i ask you the space check for
 

587
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,269
come on if i ask you the space check for
any space we are allocating

588
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:39,279
any space we are allocating
 

589
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,629

uh one
 

591
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,990
uh one
why is one don't look i mean look at the

592
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:46,000
why is one don't look i mean look at the
 

593
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,430
why is one don't look i mean look at the
code come on

594
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:47,440
code come on
 

595
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,350
code come on
yeah why is the code where is the space

596
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:49,360
yeah why is the code where is the space
 

597
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,430
yeah why is the code where is the space
where we're allocating yes

598
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:51,440
where we're allocating yes

00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,990

okay so let's first way okay it's easier

604
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:00,000
okay so let's first way okay it's easier
 

605
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,910
okay so let's first way okay it's easier
for an english problem we convert it to

606
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:01,920
for an english problem we convert it to
 

607
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,350
for an english problem we convert it to
a list problem right

608
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:03,360
a list problem right
 

609
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,670
a list problem right
and we already know how to apply the

610
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:05,680
and we already know how to apply the
 

611
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,269
and we already know how to apply the

this this is one two
 

629
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,350
this this is one two
three two one if the increase is here

630
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:35,360

so if we travel these several days

634
00:14:39,189 --> 00:14:39,199
so if we travel these several days
 

635
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:40,629
so if we travel these several days
remember previously we're putting in a

636
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:40,639
remember previously we're putting in a

00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,230
remember previously we're putting in a
video at least can be used as a step

00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:44,240
video at least can be used as a step
 

639
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,150
video at least can be used as a step
look if we put this into a list a step

640
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:48,160
look if we put this into a list a step
 

641
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,350
look if we put this into a list a step
so it's one one two three

642
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:51,360
so it's one one two three
 

643
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,629
so it's one one two three
two one right all right yeah one two

644
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:54,639
two one right all right yeah one two
 

645
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:55,189
two one right all right yeah one two
three two

646
00:14:55,189 --> 00:14:55,199
three two
 

647
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,509
three two
one and then we we work again from the

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,269
through from the head again and then we
take it from the big

672
00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:29,279
take it from the big
 

673
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,749
take it from the big
from the end yeah a stack yeah correct

674
00:15:33,749 --> 00:15:33,759
from the end yeah a stack yeah correct
 

675
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,629
from the end yeah a stack yeah correct
that we walk through this stack yeah so

676
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:36,639
that we walk through this stack yeah so
 

677
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:37,590
that we walk through this stack yeah so
we're like

678
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:37,600
we're like
 

679
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,949
we're like
this is the yeah look this is the

680
00:15:40,949 --> 00:15:40,959
this is the yeah look this is the
 

681
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,230
this is the yeah look this is the
opposite order right

682
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:42,240
opposite order right
 

683
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,389
opposite order right
you see so if your parents are in the

option
 

687
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,870
option
oh yeah yeah got it yeah okay let's try

688
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:48,880
oh yeah yeah got it yeah okay let's try
 

689
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,509
oh yeah yeah got it yeah okay let's try
this

690
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:49,519
this
 

691
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,910
this
the second approach okay and remember at

692
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:51,920
the second approach okay and remember at
 

693
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,550
the second approach okay and remember at
the end

694
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:52,560
the end
 

695
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,790
the end
i want you to write one approach at

696
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:54,800
i want you to write one approach at
 

697
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,670
i want you to write one approach at
least one okay

check note okay now we use the stack

712
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:10,399
check note okay now we use the stack
 

713
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:11,509
check note okay now we use the stack
then we turn

714
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:11,519
then we turn
 

715
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,230
then we turn
stack equals at least yeah we can use

716
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:14,240
stack equals at least yeah we can use
 

717
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,670

the list as a stack okay
 

719
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,870

okay now header is beginning now so what

750
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:10,880
okay now header is beginning now so what
 

751
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,150
okay now header is beginning now so what
should we do now

752
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:12,160
should we do now
 

753
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,829
should we do now
wire head

00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:16,839

 

755
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:20,230

now now we want to compare the head

756
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:20,240
now now we want to compare the head
 

757
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,270
now now we want to compare the head
and the top of the stack so what's the

758
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:23,280
and the top of the stack so what's the
 

759
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,470
and the top of the stack so what's the
top of stack

760
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:24,480
top of stack
 

761
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,789
top of stack
this is st what's the top value how can

762
00:17:26,789 --> 00:17:26,799
this is st what's the top value how can
 

763
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,950
this is st what's the top value how can
we get the top ready

764
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:28,960
we get the top ready
 

765
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,230
we get the top ready
but we if if the top of value is

766
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:32,240
but we if if the top of value is
 

767
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,270
but we if if the top of value is
head of value head head of value if it's

768
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:35,280
head of value head head of value if it's
 

769
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,230
head of value head head of value if it's
not equal to

not equal to
 

771
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,950
not equal to
top level very well so what's this

772
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:38,960
top level very well so what's this
 

773
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,950

00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:15,280
so what what happened to the head head
 

801
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,470
so what what happened to the head head
is there at the beginning

802
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:16,480
is there at the beginning
 

803
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,029
is there at the beginning
at the beginning i want to go to the

804
00:18:19,029 --> 00:18:19,039
at the beginning i want to go to the
 

805
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:19,990
at the beginning i want to go to the
next one head

806
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:20,000
next one head
 

807
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,270
next one head
as well

808
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:23,280

 

809
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,710

yeah and then what happened to the step

810
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:26,720
yeah and then what happened to the step
 

811
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,110
yeah and then what happened to the step
step this is x take minus one and i want

812
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:29,120
step this is x take minus one and i want
 

813
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,549
step this is x take minus one and i want
to remove it

814
00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:30,559
to remove it
 

815
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,230
to remove it
i want to take it out what should i do

816
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:32,240
i want to take it out what should i do
 

817
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,909
i want to take it out what should i do
st

818
00:18:33,909 --> 00:18:33,919
st
 

819
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,110
st
yeah that's it what's the time complex

820
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:37,120
yeah that's it what's the time complex
 

821
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:37,909

00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,830
twice right all right yeah
the first first uh first uh first

838
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:01,840
the first first uh first uh first
 

839
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,110
the first first uh first uh first
pass is to place a note into the stack

840
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:05,120
pass is to place a note into the stack
 

841
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,510
pass is to place a note into the stack
the second pass is comparing right the

842
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:07,520
the second pass is comparing right the
 

843
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,110
the second pass is comparing right the
time complexity what's the space in

844
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:09,120
time complexity what's the space in
 

845
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,520

i know actually we
 

853
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,750
i know actually we
we have two more approach okay look are

854
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:23,760
we have two more approach okay look are
 

855
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,190
we have two more approach okay look are
you kidding me

856

you kidding me
 

857
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,470
you kidding me
come on okay this is uh

858
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:30,480

 

859
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,909

look at it this is the increase yeah one

860
00:19:33,909 --> 00:19:33,919
look at it this is the increase yeah one
 

861
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,110
look at it this is the increase yeah one
two three two one so

862
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:37,120
two three two one so
 

863
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,909
two three two one so
how can we get the middle of it remember

864
00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:39,919
how can we get the middle of it remember
 

865
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,270
how can we get the middle of it remember
we talked about this

866
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:41,280
we talked about this
 

867
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,830
we talked about this
how do we how do we get the middle node

868
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:43,840
how do we how do we get the middle node
 

869
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,390
how do we how do we get the middle node
of the linked list

870
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:46,400
of the linked list
 

871
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,950
of the linked list
um we need that

872
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:50,960
um we need that
 

873
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,909
um we need that
what what how do we do it can you uh

874
00:19:55,909 --> 00:19:55,919

 

875
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,830

what i think it's a rabbit and a turtle

876
00:19:59,830 --> 00:19:59,840
what i think it's a rabbit and a turtle
 

877
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,070
what i think it's a rabbit and a turtle
rabbit yeah yeah yeah rugby and turtle

878
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:02,080
rabbit yeah yeah yeah rugby and turtle
 

879
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,669
rabbit yeah yeah yeah rugby and turtle
yeah rabbit the one which

880
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:03,679
yeah rabbit the one which
 

881
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:08,950
yeah rabbit the one which
i was very good at okay

882
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:08,960

 

883
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,549

okay so how can we how can we find can

884
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:12,559
okay so how can we how can we find can
 

885
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:13,669
okay so how can we how can we find can
can you explain

886
00:20:13,669 --> 00:20:13,679
can you explain
 

887
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,750
can you explain
to me that how can we use the rabbit to

888
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:15,760
to me that how can we use the rabbit to
 

889
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,029
to me that how can we use the rabbit to
find the turtle okay

890
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:17,039
find the turtle okay
 

891
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:27,190
find the turtle okay
rob is

892
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:27,200

 

893
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,390

yeah so fast rabbit works two step at a

894
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:30,400
yeah so fast rabbit works two step at a
 

895
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,470
yeah so fast rabbit works two step at a
time and turtle works one several times

896
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:32,480
time and turtle works one several times
 

897
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:32,950
time and turtle works one several times
so look

898
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:32,960
so look
 

899
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,149
so look
my right hand he does twice

900
00:20:36,149 --> 00:20:36,159
my right hand he does twice
 

901
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,310
my right hand he does twice
yeah two yeah yeah look look my right

902
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:38,320
yeah two yeah yeah look look my right
 

903
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,590
yeah two yeah yeah look look my right
hand is ready my

904
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:39,600
hand is ready my
 

905
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,630
hand is ready my
left hand is third okay okay let's go

906
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:42,640
left hand is third okay okay let's go
 

907
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,669
left hand is third okay okay let's go
look that's good two steps one two

908
00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:45,679
look that's good two steps one two
 

909
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,870
look that's good two steps one two
one step two step

910
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:48,880
one step two step
 

911
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,830
one step two step
one step but it can't jump to the two

912
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:51,840
one step but it can't jump to the two
 

913
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,190
one step but it can't jump to the two
steps so that's the middle

914
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:53,200
steps so that's the middle
 

915
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,270
steps so that's the middle
slow the right the total will be this

916
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:55,280
slow the right the total will be this
 

917
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,710
slow the right the total will be this
low so

918
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:56,720
low so
 

919
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,710
low so
why are we wanting these meter

920
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:00,720
why are we wanting these meter
 

921
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,310
why are we wanting these meter
what are we doing with the meter

922
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:04,320
what are we doing with the meter
 

923
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,430
what are we doing with the meter
oh because either what happened to the

924
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:07,440
oh because either what happened to the
 

925
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:07,909
oh because either what happened to the
middle

926
00:21:07,909 --> 00:21:07,919
middle
 

927
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,149
middle
why do we need the middle thing what

928
00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:10,159
why do we need the middle thing what
 

929
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:11,590
why do we need the middle thing what
happened what's the turning zone

930
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:11,600
happened what's the turning zone
 

931
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,390
happened what's the turning zone
if we break it in the middle if we break

932
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:14,400
if we break it in the middle if we break
 

933
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,510
if we break it in the middle if we break
it in the middle

934
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:15,520
it in the middle
 

935
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,630
it in the middle
both sides need to be the same no no

936
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:18,640
both sides need to be the same no no
 

937
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,270
both sides need to be the same no no
no look not exactly one more step one

938
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:21,280
no look not exactly one more step one
 

939
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:21,669
no look not exactly one more step one
two

940
00:21:21,669 --> 00:21:21,679
two
 

941
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,870
two
three two one if we break in the middle

942
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:24,880
three two one if we break in the middle
 

943
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,630
three two one if we break in the middle
so one two and two one so if we reverse

944
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:28,640
so one two and two one so if we reverse
 

945
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,350
so one two and two one so if we reverse
this bit

946
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:29,360
this bit
 

947
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,710
this bit
then you'll be the same as the first

948
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:30,720
then you'll be the same as the first
 

949
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,549
then you'll be the same as the first
okay okay

950
00:21:32,549 --> 00:21:32,559
okay okay
 

951
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,390
okay okay
so we break in the middle and then we

952
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:34,400
so we break in the middle and then we
 

953
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,710
so we break in the middle and then we
reversely speed okay

954
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:36,720
reversely speed okay
 

955
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:44,789
reversely speed okay
okay okay let's try this okay

956
00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:44,799
okay okay let's try this okay
 

957
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:51,110
okay okay let's try this okay
let's just check look uh note

958
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:51,120

 

959
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,590

okay fast equals load

960
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:55,600
okay fast equals load
 

961
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,390
okay fast equals load
equals no right at the beginning like

962
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:58,400
equals no right at the beginning like
 

963
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,870
equals no right at the beginning like
pointing to the first one right alright

964
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:00,880
pointing to the first one right alright
 

965
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,789
pointing to the first one right alright
okay

966
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:04,799

 

967
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,590

and fast to next yeah because it needs

968
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:07,600
and fast to next yeah because it needs
 

969
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,590
and fast to next yeah because it needs
to move two steps at a time

970
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:09,600
to move two steps at a time
 

971
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,710
to move two steps at a time
so what we do fast equals one slow

972
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:12,720
so what we do fast equals one slow
 

973
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,029
so what we do fast equals one slow
equals one come on

974
00:22:15,029 --> 00:22:15,039
equals one come on
 

975
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,320
equals one come on
fast is because we're slowing forward

976
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:17,330
fast is because we're slowing forward
 

977
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:18,870
fast is because we're slowing forward

sorry no fast equal

980
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:22,080
sorry no fast equal
 

981
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,669
sorry no fast equal
fast equal slow equals no at the

982
00:22:23,669 --> 00:22:23,679
fast equal slow equals no at the
 

983
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,110
fast equal slow equals no at the
beginning they are pointing to the first

984
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:25,120
beginning they are pointing to the first
 

985
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,549
beginning they are pointing to the first
position all right

986
00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:26,559
position all right
 

987
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:30,230
position all right
this is five equals nine sorry fast

988
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:30,240
this is five equals nine sorry fast
 

989
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,870
this is five equals nine sorry fast
equals no no faster equal is low equals

990
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:32,880
equals no no faster equal is low equals
 

991
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,149
equals no no faster equal is low equals
no so at the beginning

992
00:22:34,149 --> 00:22:34,159
no so at the beginning
 

993
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,310
no so at the beginning
the first needs to work two step at the

994
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:36,320
the first needs to work two step at the
 

995
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,270
the first needs to work two step at the
time right

996
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:37,280
time right
 

997
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,950
time right
so what should i do with this plus

998
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:38,960
so what should i do with this plus
 

999
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,470
so what should i do with this plus
equals one

1000
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:40,480
equals one
 

1001
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,470
equals one
five equals two spaces

1002
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:44,480
five equals two spaces
 

1003
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,870
five equals two spaces
two bases what how can we move two steps

1004
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:46,880
two bases what how can we move two steps
 

1005
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,909
two bases what how can we move two steps
faster what

1006
00:22:49,909 --> 00:22:49,919

 

1007
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,830

the link list first what's the next of

1008
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:52,840
the link list first what's the next of
 

1009
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,630
the link list first what's the next of
first

1010
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:54,640
first
 

1011
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,710
first
what's the first this is five what is

1012
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:56,720
what's the first this is five what is
 

1013
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,070
what's the first this is five what is
next

1014
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:58,080
next
 

1015
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,510
next
five plus one this is an english one

1016
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:01,520
five plus one this is an english one
 

1017
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:06,149
five plus one this is an english one
this is linked list link list

1018
00:23:06,149 --> 00:23:06,159
this is linked list link list
 

1019
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,310
this is linked list link list
what do we do with the previous one why

1020
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:08,320
what do we do with the previous one why
 

1021
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,669
what do we do with the previous one why
not dot

1022
00:23:09,669 --> 00:23:09,679
not dot
 

1023
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,110
not dot
no equals no to what next yeah fast

1024
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:13,120
no equals no to what next yeah fast
 

1025
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,909
no equals no to what next yeah fast
equals one

1026
00:23:15,909 --> 00:23:15,919

 

1027
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:32,870

there's no note five we go over come on

1028
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:32,880

 

1029
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,430

so first it needs to work one more step

1030
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:35,440
so first it needs to work one more step
 

1031
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,470
so first it needs to work one more step
so how can the police

1032
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:36,480
so how can the police
 

1033
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,510
so how can the police
first equals faster next door

1034
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:39,520
first equals faster next door
 

1035
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,310
first equals faster next door
next yeah come on how high is that next

1036
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:42,320
next yeah come on how high is that next
 

1037
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:42,950
next yeah come on how high is that next
first

1038
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:42,960
first
 

1039
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,990
first
next next let's try look why

1040
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:46,000
next next let's try look why
 

1041
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,110
next next let's try look why
fast is not none and first next is no

1042
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:49,120
fast is not none and first next is no
 

1043
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,430
fast is not none and first next is no
none we want to move two step every time

1044
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:51,440
none we want to move two step every time
 

1045
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:51,990
none we want to move two step every time
okay

1046
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:52,000
okay
 

1047
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,149
okay
so now slow is the middle right all

1048
00:23:54,149 --> 00:23:54,159
so now slow is the middle right all
 

1049
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:55,110
so now slow is the middle right all
right

1050
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:55,120
right
 

1051
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,510
right
yeah i know we want to reverse break it

1052
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:57,520
yeah i know we want to reverse break it
 

1053
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,789
yeah i know we want to reverse break it
and look

1054
00:23:58,789 --> 00:23:58,799
and look
 

1055
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,909
and look
okay look okay so

1056
00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:01,919
okay look okay so
 

1057
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,710
okay look okay so
here here is previous one yeah yeah this

1058
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:04,720
here here is previous one yeah yeah this
 

1059
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,190
here here is previous one yeah yeah this
is

1060
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:05,200
is
 

1061
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,390
is
this is slow here okay and then now i

1062
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:08,400
this is slow here okay and then now i
 

1063
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,269
this is slow here okay and then now i
want to

1064
00:24:09,269 --> 00:24:09,279
want to
 

1065
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,510
want to
i look look at what i did i want to

1066
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:11,520
i look look at what i did i want to
 

1067
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,710
i look look at what i did i want to
reverse this piece

1068
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:12,720
reverse this piece
 

1069
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,630
reverse this piece
break it and reverse this make it this

1070
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:14,640
break it and reverse this make it this
 

1071
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,190
break it and reverse this make it this
way right make it this way yeah

1072
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:17,200
way right make it this way yeah
 

1073
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,630
way right make it this way yeah
all right i want to reverse this

1074
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:18,640
all right i want to reverse this
 

1075
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,630
all right i want to reverse this
direction

1076
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:20,640
direction
 

1077
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,149
direction
yeah yeah can you stop doing that

1078
00:24:24,149 --> 00:24:24,159
yeah yeah can you stop doing that
 

1079
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,230
yeah yeah can you stop doing that
so at the beginning i won't have i will

1080
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:26,240
so at the beginning i won't have i will
 

1081
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,510
so at the beginning i won't have i will
have a right right

1082
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:27,520
have a right right
 

1083
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,510
have a right right
equals noun and now we have wire

1084
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:31,520
equals noun and now we have wire
 

1085
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,029
equals noun and now we have wire
slow and i want to

1086
00:24:35,029 --> 00:24:35,039
slow and i want to
 

1087
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,430
slow and i want to
i want to save this value first p equals

1088
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:37,440
i want to save this value first p equals
 

1089
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,310
i want to save this value first p equals
load on x

1090
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:38,320
load on x
 

1091
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,909
load on x
okay and then what and then

1092
00:24:41,909 --> 00:24:41,919
okay and then what and then
 

1093
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,950
okay and then what and then
slow down next

1094
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:44,960
slow down next
 

1095
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,070
slow down next
equals equals right yeah i want to point

1096
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:48,080
equals equals right yeah i want to point
 

1097
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,590
equals equals right yeah i want to point
it to back right

1098
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:49,600
it to back right
 

1099
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:54,710
it to back right
and then what should we do now

1100
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:54,720

 

1101
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,510

p equals no the next i want to this is

1102
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:57,520
p equals no the next i want to this is
 

1103
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,149
p equals no the next i want to this is
now p

1104
00:24:58,149 --> 00:24:58,159
now p
 

1105
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,789
now p
p will be equals to here and then slow

1106
00:25:00,789 --> 00:25:00,799
p will be equals to here and then slow
 

1107
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:01,669
p will be equals to here and then slow
down x

1108
00:25:01,669 --> 00:25:01,679
down x
 

1109
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,590
down x
so the next is here i want to point to

1110
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:03,600
so the next is here i want to point to
 

1111
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,789
so the next is here i want to point to
the previous one right

1112
00:25:04,789 --> 00:25:04,799
the previous one right
 

1113
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,950
the previous one right
which is none so i will remove this and

1114
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:06,960
which is none so i will remove this and
 

1115
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,549
which is none so i will remove this and
then here will be now

1116
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:08,559
then here will be now
 

1117
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:12,870
then here will be now
right right and then i want to move this

1118
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:12,880
right right and then i want to move this
 

1119
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,590
right right and then i want to move this
this is p this is slow and slow equals p

1120
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:15,600
this is p this is slow and slow equals p
 

1121
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,470
this is p this is slow and slow equals p
right

1122
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:16,480
right
 

1123
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,149
right
slow equals p

1124
00:25:20,149 --> 00:25:20,159
slow equals p
 

1125
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,909
slow equals p
and p is this no no no no

1126
00:25:23,909 --> 00:25:23,919
and p is this no no no no
 

1127
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,789
and p is this no no no no
actually it's right like the previous

1128
00:25:26,789 --> 00:25:26,799
actually it's right like the previous
 

1129
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:27,190
actually it's right like the previous
one

1130
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:27,200
one
 

1131
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,630
one
will be equal to slow and then slow will

1132
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:30,640
will be equal to slow and then slow will
 

1133
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,549
will be equal to slow and then slow will
be equal to here all right

1134
00:25:32,549 --> 00:25:32,559
be equal to here all right
 

1135
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:35,510
be equal to here all right
so right right would be slow and slow

1136
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:35,520
so right right would be slow and slow
 

1137
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:35,990
so right right would be slow and slow
with p

1138
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:36,000
with p
 

1139
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,909
with p
right all right so in this case we're

1140
00:25:37,909 --> 00:25:37,919
right all right so in this case we're
 

1141
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,110
right all right so in this case we're
reversing that

1142
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:39,120
reversing that
 

1143
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:47,590
reversing that
uh right it was

1144
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:47,600

 

1145
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,630

do you understand this okay i'm going to

1146
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:50,640
do you understand this okay i'm going to
 

1147
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,990
do you understand this okay i'm going to
do it one more time okay look why the

1148
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:54,000
do it one more time okay look why the
 

1149
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,630
do it one more time okay look why the
equals numb at the beginning right

1150
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:56,640
equals numb at the beginning right
 

1151
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,110
equals numb at the beginning right
this is slow slowly

1152
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:01,120
this is slow slowly
 

1153
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,110
this is slow slowly
yeah i want to reverse this speed how

1154
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:03,120
yeah i want to reverse this speed how
 

1155
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,549
yeah i want to reverse this speed how
can i reverse this bit

1156
00:26:04,549 --> 00:26:04,559
can i reverse this bit
 

1157
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,750
can i reverse this bit
first of all first of all i say this

1158
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:07,760
first of all first of all i say this
 

1159
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,630
first of all first of all i say this
value into p

1160
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:08,640
value into p
 

1161
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,070
value into p
yeah so i know this is p here right

1162
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:12,080
yeah so i know this is p here right
 

1163
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,470
yeah so i know this is p here right
look and slow down next equals right can

1164
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:14,480
look and slow down next equals right can
 

1165
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,390
look and slow down next equals right can
you tell me what's what's the slowdown

1166
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:16,400
you tell me what's what's the slowdown
 

1167
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,350
you tell me what's what's the slowdown
next equals y

1168
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:19,360

 

1169
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,510

slow down next i'll remove this equals

1170
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:21,520
slow down next i'll remove this equals
 

1171
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,870
slow down next i'll remove this equals
right here look

1172
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:22,880
right here look
 

1173
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,230
right here look
right at the beginning will be long

1174
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:24,240
right at the beginning will be long
 

1175
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,909
right at the beginning will be long
right and then y

1176
00:26:25,909 --> 00:26:25,919
right and then y
 

1177
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,870
right and then y
equals no right will be equals no right

1178
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:28,880
equals no right will be equals no right
 

1179
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,950
equals no right will be equals no right
is here

1180
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:30,960
is here
 

1181
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,630
is here
and slow equals p slope equals p

1182
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:34,640
and slow equals p slope equals p
 

1183
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,269
and slow equals p slope equals p
right so slow b equals v and at the end

1184
00:26:37,269 --> 00:26:37,279
right so slow b equals v and at the end
 

1185
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:39,669
right so slow b equals v and at the end
look at the end it will be

1186
00:26:39,669 --> 00:26:39,679
look at the end it will be
 

1187
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:41,909
look at the end it will be
slow the legs and the next iteration

1188
00:26:41,909 --> 00:26:41,919
slow the legs and the next iteration
 

1189
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,190
slow the legs and the next iteration
you're pointing this way

1190
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:43,200
you're pointing this way
 

1191
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,789
you're pointing this way
and the next acceleration from the

1192
00:26:44,789 --> 00:26:44,799
and the next acceleration from the
 

1193
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,510
and the next acceleration from the
initial and at the end the right will be

1194
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:47,520
initial and at the end the right will be
 

1195
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,029
initial and at the end the right will be
which which node will be the right at

1196
00:26:49,029 --> 00:26:49,039
which which node will be the right at
 

1197
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,870
which which node will be the right at
the end

1198
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:50,880
the end
 

1199
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,830
the end
which which now will be the right area

1200
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:55,840

 

1201
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,390

which node will be right at the end

1202
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:00,400

 

1203
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,470

one two three four which node the right

1204
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:02,480
one two three four which node the right
 

1205
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,750
one two three four which node the right
at the end

1206
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:03,760
at the end
 

1207
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,710
at the end
this is right that's the beginning and

1208
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:06,720
this is right that's the beginning and
 

1209
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,110
this is right that's the beginning and
why

1210
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:07,120
why
 

1211
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,710
why
look at it and then right because nurse

1212
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:08,720
look at it and then right because nurse
 

1213
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,590
look at it and then right because nurse
knows which one will be right at the end

1214
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:11,600
knows which one will be right at the end
 

1215
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,950
knows which one will be right at the end
just like me yes of course y equals no

1216
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:14,960
just like me yes of course y equals no
 

1217
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,830
just like me yes of course y equals no
look here

1218
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:15,840
look here
 

1219
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,669
look here
so it's right the slow yeah

1220
00:27:19,669 --> 00:27:19,679
so it's right the slow yeah
 

1221
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,029
so it's right the slow yeah
so in the middle and then slow be moving

1222
00:27:23,029 --> 00:27:23,039
so in the middle and then slow be moving
 

1223
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:23,590
so in the middle and then slow be moving
to the

1224
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:23,600
to the
 

1225
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,470
to the
piece another next so where at the end

1226
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:26,480
piece another next so where at the end
 

1227
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:26,870
piece another next so where at the end
of

1228
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:26,880
of
 

1229
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,750
of
this loop why is no which one which node

1230
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:29,760
this loop why is no which one which node
 

1231
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,669
this loop why is no which one which node
will be right come on i'm just asking

1232
00:27:31,669 --> 00:27:31,679
will be right come on i'm just asking
 

1233
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:36,389
will be right come on i'm just asking
which node will be right

1234
00:27:36,389 --> 00:27:36,399

 

1235
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:38,950

why why snow slow will be moving to the

1236
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:38,960
why why snow slow will be moving to the
 

1237
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,990
why why snow slow will be moving to the
end

1238
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:41,000
end
 

1239

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,990

no no i'm talking about this one can you

1242
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:48,000
no no i'm talking about this one can you
 

1243
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,310
no no i'm talking about this one can you
do understand what this is mean

1244
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:50,320
do understand what this is mean
 

1245
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,149
do understand what this is mean
if you understand you know you know what

1246
00:27:52,149 --> 00:27:52,159
if you understand you know you know what
 

1247
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:53,909
if you understand you know you know what
what's this bit

1248
00:27:53,909 --> 00:27:53,919
what's this bit
 

1249
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:55,830
what's this bit
this is at the beginning this is slow

1250
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:55,840
this is at the beginning this is slow
 

1251
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,870
this is at the beginning this is slow
and what's this doing here

1252
00:27:58,870 --> 00:27:58,880
and what's this doing here
 

1253
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:04,950
and what's this doing here
it's y equals none

1254
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:04,960

 

1255
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,909

next yeah and slowly slow down x equals

1256
00:28:07,909 --> 00:28:07,919
next yeah and slowly slow down x equals
 

1257
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:08,710
next yeah and slowly slow down x equals
right

1258
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:08,720
right
 

1259
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,669
right
so you're pointing back y equals note

1260
00:28:11,669 --> 00:28:11,679
so you're pointing back y equals note
 

1261
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:16,950
so you're pointing back y equals note
and slow equals p

1262
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:16,960
and slow equals p
 

1263
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,549
and slow equals p
facing this way yeah it's changing the

1264
00:28:20,549 --> 00:28:20,559
facing this way yeah it's changing the
 

1265
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:21,990
facing this way yeah it's changing the
direction to this way so

1266
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:22,000
direction to this way so
 

1267
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,110
direction to this way so
what happened to this right at the end

1268
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:25,120
what happened to this right at the end
 

1269
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,990
what happened to this right at the end
what's the value of right at the end no

1270
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:28,000
what's the value of right at the end no
 

1271
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,470
what's the value of right at the end no
but y

1272
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:28,480
but y
 

1273
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,190
but y
equals slow you're moving this way come

1274
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:31,200
equals slow you're moving this way come
 

1275
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:31,990
equals slow you're moving this way come
on

1276
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:32,000
on
 

1277
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,470
on
so what's the right come on obviously

1278
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:34,480
so what's the right come on obviously
 

1279
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,310
so what's the right come on obviously
yeah that one the 15

1280
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:36,320
yeah that one the 15
 

1281
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,950
yeah that one the 15
so that would be because this is

1282
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:38,960
so that would be because this is
 

1283
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,950
so that would be because this is
reversing yeah so at the end

1284
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:40,960
reversing yeah so at the end
 

1285
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,070
reversing yeah so at the end
the right will be the increase so what

1286
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:44,080
the right will be the increase so what
 

1287
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,389
the right will be the increase so what
should we do now what should we do now

1288
00:28:46,389 --> 00:28:46,399
should we do now what should we do now

00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:53,840
what should we do if i say left i have a
 

1295

left
 

1297
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,590
left
equals no so what should we do now

1298
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:57,600
equals no so what should we do now
 

1299
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,110
equals no so what should we do now
with left and right what should we do

1300
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:01,120
with left and right what should we do
 

1301
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,070
with left and right what should we do
we should should we start no we're not

1302
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:04,080
we should should we start no we're not
 

1303
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,430
we should should we start no we're not

1305
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,870

so remember what happened to this

1306
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:06,880
so remember what happened to this
 

1307
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,669
so remember what happened to this
linkage one two

1308
00:29:09,669 --> 00:29:09,679
linkage one two
 

1309
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,710
linkage one two
like if we break it into the half all

1310
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:12,720
like if we break it into the half all
 

1311
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,029
like if we break it into the half all
right

1312
00:29:13,029 --> 00:29:13,039
right
 

1313
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:16,310
right
what we did is breaking it in half

1314
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:16,320
what we did is breaking it in half
 

1315
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,669
what we did is breaking it in half
and reverse this speed so look at e 1

1316
00:29:19,669 --> 00:29:19,679
and reverse this speed so look at e 1
 

1317
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,870
and reverse this speed so look at e 1
2 2 1 and now reverse this bit

1318
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:22,880
2 2 1 and now reverse this bit
 

1319
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,830
2 2 1 and now reverse this bit
that's right yeah then i'll be one two

1320
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:25,840
that's right yeah then i'll be one two
 

1321
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,590
that's right yeah then i'll be one two
so what should we do with now this is

1322
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:27,600
so what should we do with now this is
 

1323
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,269
so what should we do with now this is
right

1324
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:29,279
right
 

1325
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:32,630
right
huh all right right is here and

1326
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:32,640
huh all right right is here and
 

1327
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,710
huh all right right is here and
left is here what should we do now come

1328
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:34,720
left is here what should we do now come
 

1329
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:40,789
left is here what should we do now come
on it's quite obvious come on

1330
00:29:40,789 --> 00:29:40,799
on it's quite obvious come on
 

1331
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,830
on it's quite obvious come on
reverse it i already reversed it reverse

1332
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:43,840
reverse it i already reversed it reverse
 

1333
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,230
reverse it i already reversed it reverse
it

1334
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:44,240
it
 

1335
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,590
it
one to two let's check in it's the same

1336
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:47,600
one to two let's check in it's the same
 

1337
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,430
one to two let's check in it's the same
yeah chicken left and right but it's the

1338
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:49,440
yeah chicken left and right but it's the
 

1339
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,430
yeah chicken left and right but it's the
same okay so okay i'm gonna

1340
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:51,440
same okay so okay i'm gonna
 

1341
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,310
same okay so okay i'm gonna
erase this and then left right okay so

1342
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:54,320
erase this and then left right okay so
 

1343
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,430
erase this and then left right okay so
that's the easy part

1344
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:55,440
that's the easy part
 

1345
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,710
that's the easy part
wire left and right

1346
00:29:58,710 --> 00:29:58,720
wire left and right
 

1347
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,230
wire left and right
right

1348
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:02,240

 

1349
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,430

if left top value

1350
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:05,440
if left top value
 

1351
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,630
if left top value
not equal right of value

1352
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:08,640
not equal right of value
 

1353
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,750
not equal right of value
what should we do if letter value is not

1354
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:11,760
what should we do if letter value is not
 

1355
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,230
what should we do if letter value is not
equal right already what we do

1356
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:14,240
equal right already what we do
 

1357
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,730
equal right already what we do
um

1358
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:17,740

 

1359
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:20,549

[Music]

1360
00:30:20,549 --> 00:30:20,559
[Music]
 

1361
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:21,990
[Music]
and then what should we do with the left

1362
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:22,000
and then what should we do with the left
 

1363
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,990
and then what should we do with the left
hand left equals one and right equals

1364
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:24,000
hand left equals one and right equals
 

1365
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,430
hand left equals one and right equals
one come on

1366
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:27,440

 

1367
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:32,789

and then we turn what come on

1368
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:32,799

 

1369
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:37,430

next left equals left or next we're done

1370
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:37,440
next left equals left or next we're done
 

1371
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,230
next left equals left or next we're done
yeah and then we turn one okay yeah

1372
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:40,240
yeah and then we turn one okay yeah
 

1373
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,590
yeah and then we turn one okay yeah
we're just comparing left and right yeah

1374
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:43,600
we're just comparing left and right yeah
 

1375
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,190
we're just comparing left and right yeah
why is that because we already break it

1376
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:45,200
why is that because we already break it
 

1377
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,029
why is that because we already break it
into half and we watch the second half

1378
00:30:47,029 --> 00:30:47,039
into half and we watch the second half
 

1379
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:47,830
into half and we watch the second half
so

1380
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:47,840
so
 

1381
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,070
so
the second half is star with the right

1382
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:50,080
the second half is star with the right
 

1383
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,750
the second half is star with the right
yeah the first half is starting with

1384
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:51,760
yeah the first half is starting with
 

1385
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,590
yeah the first half is starting with
left with the no yeah i was just

1386
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:53,600
left with the no yeah i was just
 

1387
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,870
left with the no yeah i was just
comparing yeah what's the time

1388
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:54,880
comparing yeah what's the time
 

1389
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,710
comparing yeah what's the time
complexity

1390
00:30:58,710 --> 00:30:58,720

 

1391
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,149

what's the time of maxi

1392
00:31:02,149 --> 00:31:02,159

 

1393
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:03,909

oh n what's a space complexity are we

1394
00:31:03,909 --> 00:31:03,919
oh n what's a space complexity are we
 

1395
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:08,870
oh n what's a space complexity are we
using any space here this this approach

1396
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:08,880

 

1397
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,269

do we decide space we just mine or what

1398
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:11,279
do we decide space we just mine or what
 

1399
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:12,070
do we decide space we just mine or what
and

1400
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:12,080
and
 

1401
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,070
and
we are not using any space but the thing

1402
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:14,080
we are not using any space but the thing
 

1403
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,509
we are not using any space but the thing
is we are

1404
00:31:15,509 --> 00:31:15,519
is we are
 

1405
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,750
is we are
modifying the list yeah we are making

1406
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:17,760
modifying the list yeah we are making
 

1407
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,070
modifying the list yeah we are making
changes to the original list i'm right

1408
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:20,080
changes to the original list i'm right
 

1409
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:24,230
changes to the original list i'm right
yeah okay

1410
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:24,240

 

1411
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,549

okay the last approach quickly we're

1412
00:31:26,549 --> 00:31:26,559
okay the last approach quickly we're
 

1413
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,310
okay the last approach quickly we're
using recursion this is more advanced

1414
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:28,320
using recursion this is more advanced
 

1415
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,190
using recursion this is more advanced
okay

1416
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:29,200
okay
 

1417
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,950
okay
so define check

1418
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:32,960
so define check
 

1419
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,470
so define check
i'm going to write it okay no

1420
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:36,480
i'm going to write it okay no
 

1421
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,750
i'm going to write it okay no
not no why

1422
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:39,760
not no why
 

1423
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,029
not no why
what why do we call it node

1424
00:31:43,029 --> 00:31:43,039
what why do we call it node
 

1425
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:46,470
what why do we call it node
if it's a tree that's a root right three

1426
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:46,480
if it's a tree that's a root right three
 

1427
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,590
if it's a tree that's a root right three
has a root if a node linkers

1428
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:49,600
has a root if a node linkers
 

1429
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,830
has a root if a node linkers
is not just one direction it hasn't have

1430
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:51,840
is not just one direction it hasn't have
 

1431
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,269
is not just one direction it hasn't have
a root right

1432
00:31:53,269 --> 00:31:53,279
a root right
 

1433
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:58,070
a root right
okay it's just the numbing convention

1434
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:58,080

 

1435
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,470

so at the beginning note i will set it

1436
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:00,480
so at the beginning note i will set it
 

1437
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,509
so at the beginning note i will set it
to the beginning

1438
00:32:01,509 --> 00:32:01,519
to the beginning
 

1439
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:07,430
to the beginning
uh okay so look

1440
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:07,440

 

1441
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,470

okay so the thing is that if i

1442
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:10,480
okay so the thing is that if i
 

1443
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,669
okay so the thing is that if i
i the thing is the the target if i want

1444
00:32:13,669 --> 00:32:13,679
i the thing is the the target if i want
 

1445
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:14,389
i the thing is the the target if i want
to compare

1446
00:32:14,389 --> 00:32:14,399
to compare
 

1447
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:15,909
to compare
i want to compare the parent release

1448
00:32:15,909 --> 00:32:15,919
i want to compare the parent release
 

1449
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:17,509
i want to compare the parent release
that i want to compare this now which

1450
00:32:17,509 --> 00:32:17,519
that i want to compare this now which
 

1451
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,590
that i want to compare this now which
original

1452
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:19,600
original
 

1453
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,149
original
which which you know we should know the

1454
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:22,159
which which you know we should know the
 

1455
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:23,509
which which you know we should know the
last one and at least no i want to

1456
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:23,519
last one and at least no i want to
 

1457
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,350
last one and at least no i want to
compare with original

1458
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:25,360
compare with original
 

1459
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,590
compare with original
the second one yeah we're done so look

1460
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:27,600
the second one yeah we're done so look
 

1461
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,590
the second one yeah we're done so look
we can use the recursion yeah let's call

1462
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:29,600
we can use the recursion yeah let's call
 

1463
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,710
we can use the recursion yeah let's call
it recursion dfs

1464
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:32,720
it recursion dfs
 

1465
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,230
it recursion dfs
node right if

1466
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:36,240
node right if
 

1467
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:44,310
node right if
not node we just return two right

1468
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:44,320

 

1469
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,549

okay and then i have an answer answer i

1470
00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:46,559
okay and then i have an answer answer i
 

1471
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:47,750
okay and then i have an answer answer i
will check the next one

1472
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:47,760
will check the next one
 

1473
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:53,350
will check the next one
we see dfs no dot next

1474
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:53,360

 

1475
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,190

and then root will be equal

1476
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:57,200
and then root will be equal
 

1477
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,470
and then root will be equal
to at the beginning next

1478
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:00,480
to at the beginning next
 

1479
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:05,750
to at the beginning next
and then i can return answer that's it

1480
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:05,760

 

1481
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,509

okay i'll tell you later okay and i can

1482
00:33:07,509 --> 00:33:07,519
okay i'll tell you later okay and i can
 

1483
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,149
okay i'll tell you later okay and i can
just return

1484
00:33:10,149 --> 00:33:10,159
just return
 

1485
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:13,350
just return
d f s note that's it you see

1486
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:13,360
d f s note that's it you see
 

1487
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,549
d f s note that's it you see
is this simple look uh here i need to

1488
00:33:16,549 --> 00:33:16,559
is this simple look uh here i need to
 

1489
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,549
is this simple look uh here i need to
add the access to this node so i will

1490
00:33:18,549 --> 00:33:18,559
add the access to this node so i will
 

1491
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:18,870
add the access to this node so i will
add

1492
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:18,880
add
 

1493
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,750
add
one non-loader okay that's the syntax

1494
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:21,760
one non-loader okay that's the syntax
 

1495
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,630
one non-loader okay that's the syntax
you need to add

1496
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:22,640
you need to add
 

1497
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,509
you need to add
none longer route so he knows that when

1498
00:33:25,509 --> 00:33:25,519
none longer route so he knows that when
 

1499
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:26,710
none longer route so he knows that when
when we

1500
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:26,720
when we
 

1501
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,630
when we
change this speed it's changing this

1502
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:28,640
change this speed it's changing this
 

1503
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,909
change this speed it's changing this
value not

1504
00:33:29,909 --> 00:33:29,919
value not
 

1505
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:32,549
value not
not the scope inside this value so it

1506
00:33:32,549 --> 00:33:32,559
not the scope inside this value so it
 

1507
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,789
not the scope inside this value so it
says non-local load means that this root

1508
00:33:34,789 --> 00:33:34,799
says non-local load means that this root
 

1509
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:35,350
says non-local load means that this root
is here

1510
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:35,360
is here
 

1511
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:40,549
is here
not inside here okay okay so look

1512
00:33:40,549 --> 00:33:40,559
not inside here okay okay so look
 

1513
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:43,029
not inside here okay okay so look
this is the recursion right if the note

1514
00:33:43,029 --> 00:33:43,039
this is the recursion right if the note
 

1515
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:43,669
this is the recursion right if the note
is

1516
00:33:43,669 --> 00:33:43,679
is
 

1517
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,950
is
nothing it returns true right an empty

1518
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:46,960
nothing it returns true right an empty
 

1519
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,310
nothing it returns true right an empty
node

1520
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:48,320
node
 

1521
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,830
node
an empty node a linked list is it a

1522
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:50,840
an empty node a linked list is it a
 

1523
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,630
an empty node a linked list is it a
pendulum

1524
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:52,640
pendulum
 

1525
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,509
pendulum
yes yeah okay then now i will check the

1526
00:33:55,509 --> 00:33:55,519
yes yeah okay then now i will check the
 

1527
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:57,830
yes yeah okay then now i will check the
next one

1528
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:57,840
next one
 

1529
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,230
next one
but when these look when these this is

1530
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:00,240
but when these look when these this is
 

1531
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,549
but when these look when these this is
recursion when it goes only cause it

1532
00:34:02,549 --> 00:34:02,559
recursion when it goes only cause it
 

1533
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:05,110
recursion when it goes only cause it
so at this point you will go you cause

1534
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:05,120
so at this point you will go you cause
 

1535
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,549
so at this point you will go you cause
it itself

1536
00:34:06,549 --> 00:34:06,559
it itself
 

1537
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,470
it itself
cause it's until you reach the last

1538
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:08,480
cause it's until you reach the last
 

1539
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,310
cause it's until you reach the last
point last note

1540
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:10,320
point last note
 

1541
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,829
point last note
and when you reach the last note right

1542
00:34:13,829 --> 00:34:13,839
and when you reach the last note right
 

1543
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:16,710
and when you reach the last note right
you wanted uh okay so there's something

1544
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:16,720
you wanted uh okay so there's something
 

1545
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,270
you wanted uh okay so there's something
missing here so i wanted to say

1546
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:19,280
missing here so i wanted to say
 

1547
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,310
missing here so i wanted to say
if i said we don't need to

1548
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:22,320
if i said we don't need to
 

1549
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,430
if i said we don't need to
say no no no no no

1550
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:25,440
say no no no no no
 

1551
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,349
say no no no no no
no at the beginning it's not okay so i

1552
00:34:27,349 --> 00:34:27,359
no at the beginning it's not okay so i
 

1553
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:29,430
no at the beginning it's not okay so i
have to check it if little dot value is

1554
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:29,440
have to check it if little dot value is
 

1555
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,109
have to check it if little dot value is
not equal as

1556
00:34:31,109 --> 00:34:31,119
not equal as
 

1557
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,310
not equal as
know the value and i want to i want to

1558
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:34,320
know the value and i want to i want to
 

1559
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,589
know the value and i want to i want to
return force here yeah

1560
00:34:35,589 --> 00:34:35,599
return force here yeah
 

1561
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,829
return force here yeah
yeah i i want to return first so i will

1562
00:34:37,829 --> 00:34:37,839
yeah i i want to return first so i will
 

1563
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:38,710
yeah i i want to return first so i will
go to the next

1564
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:38,720
go to the next
 

1565
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,790
go to the next
and then what's what what's the new

1566
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:40,800
and then what's what what's the new
 

1567
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,310
and then what's what what's the new
value is the beginning yeah

1568
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:42,320
value is the beginning yeah
 

1569
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,470
value is the beginning yeah
what's the last value that will be the

1570
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:44,480
what's the last value that will be the
 

1571
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,310
what's the last value that will be the
note will be

1572
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:46,320
note will be
 

1573
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,270
note will be
after the number will be last ready and

1574
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:49,280
after the number will be last ready and
 

1575
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,950
after the number will be last ready and
then

1576
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:50,960
then
 

1577
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,750
then
the load equals to the next so so okay

1578
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:53,760
the load equals to the next so so okay
 

1579
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,470
the load equals to the next so so okay
i'm going to

1580
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:54,480
i'm going to
 

1581
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,510
i'm going to
check this okay i'll tell you okay so

1582
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:57,520
check this okay i'll tell you okay so
 

1583
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,270
check this okay i'll tell you okay so
look

1584
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:00,280

 

1585
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:03,349

blue equals note at the beginning right

1586
00:35:03,349 --> 00:35:03,359
blue equals note at the beginning right
 

1587
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,430
blue equals note at the beginning right
all right and then you'll call this

1588
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:05,440
all right and then you'll call this
 

1589
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,710
all right and then you'll call this
newton

1590
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:06,720
newton
 

1591
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,349
newton
recursion not next non-max dot next and

1592
00:35:09,349 --> 00:35:09,359
recursion not next non-max dot next and
 

1593
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:11,030
recursion not next non-max dot next and
then it will be calling state

1594
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:11,040
then it will be calling state
 

1595
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,630
then it will be calling state
calling stack it will reach the last

1596
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:12,640
calling stack it will reach the last
 

1597
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,310
calling stack it will reach the last
point right then

1598
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:14,320
point right then
 

1599
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,750
point right then
you will check if you know the value

1600
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:15,760
you will check if you know the value
 

1601
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,670
you will check if you know the value
equals another value if it's the same

1602
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:17,680
equals another value if it's the same
 

1603
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,310
equals another value if it's the same
if it's not the same you'll return first

1604
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:20,320
if it's not the same you'll return first
 

1605
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:20,950
if it's not the same you'll return first
otherwise

1606
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:20,960
otherwise
 

1607
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,349
otherwise
do the value will go to the next after

1608
00:35:23,349 --> 00:35:23,359
do the value will go to the next after
 

1609
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:24,950
do the value will go to the next after
recursion right

1610
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:24,960
recursion right
 

1611
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,750
recursion right
right and then this comes back will be

1612
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:27,760
right and then this comes back will be
 

1613
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,710
right and then this comes back will be
the previous one

1614
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:28,720
the previous one
 

1615
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,470
the previous one
right until it yeah does it make sense

1616
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:32,480
right until it yeah does it make sense
 

1617
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,950
right until it yeah does it make sense
the time contact is clone the space

1618
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:34,960
the time contact is clone the space
 

1619
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,390
the time contact is clone the space
complexity because we are using the

1620
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:36,400
complexity because we are using the
 

1621
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,790
complexity because we are using the
recursion is one right

1622
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:38,800
recursion is one right
 

1623
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,430
recursion is one right
yeah this one is a little more advanced

1624
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:41,440
yeah this one is a little more advanced
 

1625
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,790
yeah this one is a little more advanced
the problem is

1626
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:42,800
the problem is
 

1627
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,109
the problem is
why this work is because there's a stack

1628
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:45,119
why this work is because there's a stack
 

1629
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,430
why this work is because there's a stack
it's like a step and where is the step

1630
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:47,440
it's like a step and where is the step
 

1631
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,829
it's like a step and where is the step
is this recursion it's the recursion

1632
00:35:51,829 --> 00:35:51,839
is this recursion it's the recursion
 

1633
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:53,270
is this recursion it's the recursion
recursion because every time we're

1634
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:53,280
recursion because every time we're
 

1635
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,030
recursion because every time we're
calling that recursion

1636
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:55,040
calling that recursion
 

1637
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,430
calling that recursion
right every time we call in the

1638
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:57,440
right every time we call in the
 

1639
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,710
right every time we call in the
recursion when these

1640
00:35:58,710 --> 00:35:58,720
recursion when these
 

1641
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,750
recursion when these
goes to the end when this goes to the

1642
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:01,760
goes to the end when this goes to the
 

1643
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,470
goes to the end when this goes to the
end

1644
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:02,480
end
 

1645
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,550
end
right you stop here go to the end and

1646
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:04,560
right you stop here go to the end and
 

1647
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,589
right you stop here go to the end and
you'll come back

1648
00:36:05,589 --> 00:36:05,599
you'll come back
 

1649
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:06,950
you'll come back
you'll come back you're calling step

1650
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:06,960
you'll come back you're calling step
 

1651
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,829
you'll come back you're calling step
you'll come back right correct

1652
00:36:10,829 --> 00:36:10,839

 

1653
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:13,670

okay okay so i have talked about four

1654
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:13,680
okay okay so i have talked about four
 

1655
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,109
okay okay so i have talked about four

convert it to a list that's the simplest

1722
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:44,400
convert it to a list that's the simplest
 

1723
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,990
convert it to a list that's the simplest
one simply

1724
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:46,000
one simply
 

1725
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,069
one simply
yeah you just converted this what

1726
00:37:48,069 --> 00:37:48,079
yeah you just converted this what
 

1727
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:49,430
yeah you just converted this what
happened

1728
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:49,440
happened
 

1729
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,069
happened
if we want to convert it we just well

1730
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:52,079
if we want to convert it we just well
 

1731
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:53,589
if we want to convert it we just well
okay

1732
00:37:53,589 --> 00:37:53,599
okay
 

1733
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:56,069
okay
okay let's try a list yeah how do you

1734
00:37:56,069 --> 00:37:56,079
okay let's try a list yeah how do you
 

1735
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,069
okay let's try a list yeah how do you
define a list

1736
00:37:58,069 --> 00:37:58,079
define a list
 

1737
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:02,829
define a list
let me which one

1738
00:38:02,829 --> 00:38:02,839
let me which one
 

1739
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:05,430
let me which one
is on the first one or second one second

1740
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:05,440
is on the first one or second one second
 

1741
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,510
is on the first one or second one second
one is a step

1742
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:07,520
one is a step
 

1743
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:12,630
one is a step
yeah we walk through the link list

1744
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:12,640

 

1745
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,790

what does that mean advanced means it's

1746
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:14,800
what does that mean advanced means it's
 

1747
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,230
what does that mean advanced means it's
difficult to understand

1748
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:16,240
difficult to understand
 

1749
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,630
difficult to understand
and it's not it's not required if you

1750
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:18,640
and it's not it's not required if you
 

1751
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,670
and it's not it's not required if you
don't write it

1752
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:19,680
don't write it
 

1753
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,190
don't write it
and because it's harder to understand

1754
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:23,200
and because it's harder to understand
 

1755
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,510
and because it's harder to understand
is the second one with the stack yes

1756
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:25,520
is the second one with the stack yes
 

1757
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,630
is the second one with the stack yes
there yes

1758
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:26,640
there yes
 

1759
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:34,070
there yes
is it is it like this yeah what's this

1760
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:34,080

this is the third approach okay we

1764
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:38,560
this is the third approach okay we
 

1765
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,230
this is the third approach okay we
have the third approach we're breaking

1766
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:40,240
have the third approach we're breaking
 

1767
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,470
have the third approach we're breaking
into the half right

into the half right
 

1769
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,870
into the half right
the step just and you you can use any

1770
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:44,880
the step just and you you can use any
 

1771
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,950
the step just and you you can use any
men to declare a stack okay come on

1772
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:46,960
men to declare a stack okay come on
