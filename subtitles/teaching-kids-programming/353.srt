1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,120
hello mr all right

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:08,400
yeah okay so yesterday we talked about

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,639
the uh condoms on the the aids you know

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,080
what's that human gene yeah

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:17,199
yeah so given a gene group we want to

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,240
find the number of uh mutation group for

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,439
the gene

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,960
so a pairs with what

9
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,480
uh

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,240
c pairs please

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,560
yeah i know you uh how we're using it

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,320
we're using the step first third right

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,920
remember deficits do you still remember

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,440
let's form yesterday

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,079
yeah we go

16
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,960
this is the genes answer equals zero so

17
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,399
that genes is the vertex each vertex and

18
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,640
we want to find

19
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,600
start of breakfast search as long as

20
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,520
it's not

21
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,440
visited right it's not visited when we

22
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,120
start developer search

23
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:53,680
with the

24
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:56,879
vertex we increment the answer right

25
00:00:53,680 --> 00:01:01,199
all right can you stop that please

26
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:04,080
ac acct the neighbor its mutation only

27
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,600
by one difference is gcct

28
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,360
right so there's an edge between these

29
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,520
two vertices

30
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,600
yeah so there's an edge between these

31
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,080
two vertex so then i do it when i do

32
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,680
this data search

33
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:20,720
i go i find out i it brew for the

34
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,119
possibility of one letter difference

35
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,759
and then i check if it's in

36
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,119
if there's a vertex for it then i

37
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,360
definitely search

38
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,680
so in other words when we do this level

39
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,840
search we try to visit all the vertex

40
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,960
connected to current vertex right and

41
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,439
then when

42
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,479
we visited

43
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,360
these components and we'll try this one

44
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,520
yeah

45
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,920
at the same time we mark it as one and

46
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,799
we do the different search so what's

47
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,560
here

48
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,479
so this is the different search for the

49
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,920
graph right but for these one we can do

50
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,119
this breakfast surgery as well right so

51
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,119
for here i can do this right in for the

52
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,320
other vertex here yeah

53
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,079
yeah

54
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,240
we can do this step research to connect

55
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,240
all the pieces to mark all the pieces we

56
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,040
can also do the preferred search right

57
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,280
yeah

58
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,280
it'll be the same right

59
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,959
makes sense

60
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,239
okay

61
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,239
so do you still remember how we

62
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,160
implement the process

63
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,400
yeah how do you implement the preference

64
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,400
search

65
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,560
this is stefan search now i can change

66
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,319
this to breakfast search and change

67
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,599
these to processors

68
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,160
yeah

69
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:30,319
but obviously i can i still need to do a

70
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,400
little bit more work right

71
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:36,000
so how can we do this

72
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:39,120
for the test for the question search

73
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,720
yeah yeah exactly okay so this perfect

74
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,120
such i

75
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,360
i just need to

76
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,599
erase all of it but this this thing is

77
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,680
the same right so we haven't

78
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,879
finished this yet

79
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,879
so

80
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,879
these stairs work okay so for answer

81
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,040
equals you know this stores the number

82
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,879
of connected components right we want to

83
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,640
find out the number of

84
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,879
you know the number of what islands or

85
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,040
whatever yeah the trees yeah

86
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,040
the

87
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,760
yeah

88
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,879
maybe not a tree okay

89
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,879
uh

90
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,120
isolated

91
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:18,159
what do you call it isolated component

92
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,720
okay components so the task is to find

93
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:23,760
how many components are there right

94
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,360
so for we start with any vertex in the

95
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,040
component we do this preference search

96
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,640
of different search yesterday we talked

97
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,440
about differences now we're focusing on

98
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,440
the processors so in order to

99
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,360
implement preference search what kind of

100
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,640
data structure can we can we use to

101
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,640
implement the data search

102
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,400
definition recursion and how about

103
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,040
preference search

104
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,040
represent

105
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,879
put a note a here

106
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,400
we take it out

107
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:02,000
we put it connected neighbors yeah it

108
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,239
could be four right

109
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,159
yeah and then we take one now we again

110
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,080
push the kids on the right hand side

111
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:11,280
open one open

112
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:17,120
append right pop left

113
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,120
dq double and dq yeah yeah okay

114
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,720
okay so let's let's do this

115
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,680
first of all

116
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,000
uh

117
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,040
we convert these genes this is the list

118
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,479
of vertex this vertex we convert it to a

119
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,759
set so let's say g equals set

120
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,240
gene

121
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,320
why are we converting this to to set

122
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:43,120
what's the advantage if we convert the

123
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,120
list into a set it will be a one a one

124
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,479
yeah so we if you want to find out a

125
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,960
number like like this one two three

126
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:53,600
or whatever you want to find for example

127
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,479
three is in the list yeah this is the

128
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,639
list

129
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,160
that's on right i want time to look up

130
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,120
you know what's good because the last

131
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,199
one it finds it sequentially right it

132
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,639
checks if the first element is the one

133
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,280
you're looking for

134
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,199
if yes that's great right if not keep

135
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,919
going keep going so in worst case it

136
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,759
needs n iterations before it

137
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,960
finds it or not right but if we're

138
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:20,320
converting these to a set

139
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:22,320
then we can just say a element in a in

140
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,880
set a right in set a

141
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,960
then that's a one because of the hash

142
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,280
key hash table yeah we we talked about

143
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,960
the hash integration

144
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,000
yeah

145
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:37,120
so we convert it to a set

146
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,800
and now we can do this uh define

147
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,160
first search

148
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:44,880
a

149
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:47,199
first of all i put a q q equals dq

150
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,160
and i put the root which is a in it

151
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,440
right

152
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:55,120
at the beginning so this is the node a

153
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:57,120
right and then here b here will be c

154
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,600
i i don't know b and then here will be

155
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,199
another number this is the graph right

156
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,240
graph

157
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,560
yeah

158
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,160
and direction the graph

159
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,919
if it's not connected yeah it's not

160
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,960
connected

161
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,000
all right

162
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,039
so

163
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,479
okay

164
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,759
so product a as a wire

165
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,960
wireless

166
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:22,479
and element in the queue we take the qr

167
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:26,319
current equals q dot

168
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:28,880
pop left yeah pop left

169
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:32,720
and then we need to look we we have this

170
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:35,199
a c this a okay current equal could be

171
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,360
could be a string yeah a c c t or

172
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,039
whatever okay so what's what's what is

173
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,199
the neighbor how do we generate a

174
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,880
neighbor

175
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,120
we can try

176
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,280
to replace each letter with four

177
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,560
possibilities right that could be its

178
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,960
neighbor right

179
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,680
yeah so we can we need to try every

180
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,599
possibility for follow

181
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,759
each letter we try it's negative how

182
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,639
many neighbors does it have

183
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,240
uh

184
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,919
three

185
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,160
yeah that's a good one it's three it's

186
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:06,319
not actually yeah because the numbers of

187
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,199
genes are unique right so we don't

188
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,400
consider the duplicate of the duplicate

189
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,759
right so we don't need to consider

190
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,240
itself right

191
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,319
so it's three because if a letter c then

192
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,080
there will be other three choices but we

193
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,960
we can

194
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,360
you know

195
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:25,039
we can simplify the implementation right

196
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:27,440
i actually for i in i will be the index

197
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:30,479
in range

198
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,479
length current

199
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:35,199
okay and then now i want to try to

200
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:37,360
substitute this index i with other

201
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,800
choices yeah so for

202
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,639
x in

203
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,840
you said there are three choices but

204
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,170
let's leave all the four choices

205
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,680
a c

206
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:46,060
[Music]

207
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,520
g

208
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:49,360
[Music]

209
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,759
t right

210
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:55,280
yeah because look at this player a

211
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:58,160
converts t c will be g right but we are

212
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,319
considering just this these this is the

213
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,639
genes number of genes yeah

214
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,160
for the inside chromosome a human

215
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,759
chromosome yeah

216
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,639
human has twenty three commas and one

217
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,960
i'm like is the gender right x axis is

218
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,039
the girls x y is the boys

219
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,960
and then each chronosome has hundreds of

220
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:19,039
these these pairs

221
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:21,520
right and a matches t and c matches g

222
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:24,479
so it's very robust right so why not one

223
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,440
of them is broken the human can repay

224
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,160
right

225
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,479
yeah so that's called dna

226
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,120
how can you repair it look this is

227
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:35,200
broken and just look it up this is a so

228
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,279
this must be

229
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,039
exactly yeah you see unless these two

230
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,440
are broken so

231
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:44,080
the chances of two

232
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,959
broken the sun at the same time is less

233
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,000
likely than one broken right all right

234
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,880
makes sense

235
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,120
yeah

236
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,720
so it's like two servers one server go

237
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,279
down

238
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,880
could happen right but to the

239
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:59,760
two servers

240
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,880
at the same time going down

241
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,600
is

242
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,519
a lot less likely yeah at the same time

243
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,120
at the same time yeah the challenges are

244
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,240
less likely right because for example

245
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,720
like maybe this this one percent of time

246
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,480
those stars right and this is another

247
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,800
one percent goes down so

248
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,680
what's the probability of these two go

249
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,680
down at the same time

250
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,640
you do what what operation for this

251
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:32,000
this is 0.01 and then this is 0.01 so

252
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,440
what's the probability of both going

253
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,460
down

254
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,920
0.

255
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:40,080
[Music]

256
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:43,600
yeah you multiplying together

257
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,600
yeah so what's the chance

258
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,839
0.0001 right

259
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:52,160
so what's this

260
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,959
chance it's zero point zero one percent

261
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,920
okay

262
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,760
you see

263
00:09:53,920 --> 00:10:00,240
i even have three summers going down but

264
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:04,240
first you did three zeroes after the

265
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:06,000
decimal but then you did one

266
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,720
sorry what do you mean he did three

267
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,600
zeros here but now he did one

268
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,440
0.01

269
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:17,200
this is percent so you need to divide by

270
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:19,040
100 here so put another to zero

271
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,399
yeah so that's three zero that's fine

272
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,480
yeah okay

273
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,839
so another another computer going down

274
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,440
at the same time

275
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,480
you multiply right

276
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,160
yeah

277
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,680
make sense

278
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,040
yeah we talked about the probabilities

279
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:35,680
before right so one of them has the

280
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,680
one of them

281
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,920
that they are okay so there are two two

282
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,720
coins

283
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,279
yeah

284
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,279
two coins

285
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:50,399
so

286
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:53,519
this box can have a coin oh yeah 50 50.

287
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,680
and then here is 50 50. okay so both

288
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,680
both boxes not having a coin what's the

289
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,680
probability

290
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,519
fifty percent has coin fifty percent has

291
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,079
gone

292
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:10,360
and what's the probability of both

293
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,360
not having any coins in it

294
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:32,240
keep dividing yeah keep keep turns top

295
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,720
right okay

296
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,720
yeah yeah yeah

297
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,320
yeah

298
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:40,240
yeah yeah right okay so if x in this

299
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,720
then the next the

300
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,000
end the new one would be

301
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,120
uh

302
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,880
current yeah current up to i

303
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:54,079
so look here this is i current up to i i

304
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,360
wanted this part okay this is i i only

305
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:58,639
start

306
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,639
plus x this is the four possibilities

307
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:03,519
and plus this bit here

308
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:06,240
so which is current

309
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:08,079
i plus 1 to the n y

310
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,399
and this is neighbor i try each

311
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:14,000
possibility and then i just have to say

312
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:15,760
if n in g right we have this one

313
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,680
right if we have this one what should we

314
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,760
do first of all we should what should we

315
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,360
do with this if we have found the

316
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:24,839
neighbor what should we do

317
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,839
what should we do

318
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:42,639
and apparently what

319
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,880
kill the apparent and

320
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,160
without

321
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,360
yeah

322
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:51,920
i know b that's the breakfast okay so

323
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,760
what's the difference is this one yeah

324
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,240
we going through each vertex

325
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,000
if it's not being marked visited

326
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,680
instead of doing that research we're

327
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,320
doing the breakfast search

328
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,120
because the target our our target is the

329
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,200
same

330
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,720
our target is to follow

331
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,680
the edges

332
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,680
to visit all its neighbors yeah it could

333
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,519
be many neighbors huh yeah could be

334
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,680
connected look at it

335
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:19,360
it could be many

336
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,360
all right look it's always here

337
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,839
so with the tefl search you just visit

338
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,480
all right yeah with the breakfast search

339
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,160
it's still visible we'll mark it as

340
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,720
you know mark is

341
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,720
visited so how to remark is visited we

342
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,200
do know it from the g

343
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,959
this is g will be a set of the vertex

344
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,519
which has not been

345
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,639
visited so once we visit it we remove it

346
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,519
from the g

347
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,959
right so we just remove it and remove it

348
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,199
yeah

349
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:50,399
and once we

350
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:52,880
we mark it then we continue to visit

351
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:55,600
those vertex which has not been uh

352
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,360
visited right but once we when we

353
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,440
started we need to implement answer

354
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,279
equals one because that we start another

355
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,680
new

356
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:06,959
component new component right so these

357
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,959
targets to find how many

358
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:13,040
different components okay

359
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:16,279
that's it for today bye bye

360
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,279
bye bye
