on the chest on the chest okay for
 

25
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,189
on the chest on the chest okay for
example

26
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:29,199
example
 

27
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,669
example
one two three four five one two three

28
00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:31,679
one two three four five one two three
 

29
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:32,470
one two three four five one two three
four five

30
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:32,480
four five
 

31
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,030
four five
six maybe one more okay so this is six

32
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:35,040
six maybe one more okay so this is six
 

33
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,549
six maybe one more okay so this is six
times six chessboard

34
00:00:36,549 --> 00:00:36,559
times six chessboard
 

35
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,790
times six chessboard
it looks is it's like a looks i don't

36
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:38,800
it looks is it's like a looks i don't
 

37
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,310
it looks is it's like a looks i don't
know how to draw it and i really think

38
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:40,320
know how to draw it and i really think
 

39
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,389
know how to draw it and i really think
there's such thing as a six times fifth

40
00:00:42,389 --> 00:00:42,399
there's such thing as a six times fifth
 

41
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:43,030
there's such thing as a six times fifth
chest

42
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:43,040
chest
 

43
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,590
chest
yeah it's eight times a right yeah okay

44
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:45,600
yeah it's eight times a right yeah okay
 

45
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,470
yeah it's eight times a right yeah okay
so for example

46
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:46,480
so for example
 

47
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,709
so for example
right that looks like a person okay so

48
00:00:48,709 --> 00:00:48,719
right that looks like a person okay so
 

49
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,470
right that looks like a person okay so
let's put in a person a person can

50
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:50,480
let's put in a person a person can
 

51
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,029
let's put in a person a person can
attack

52
00:00:51,029 --> 00:00:51,039
attack
 

53
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,830
attack
each other if if they are on the same

54
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:55,840
each other if if they are on the same
 

55
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,750
each other if if they are on the same
rows or columns that's it have a

56
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:57,760
rows or columns that's it have a
 

57
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,310
rows or columns that's it have a
diagonal no no just looks and colors so

58
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:00,320
diagonal no no just looks and colors so
 

59
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:00,630
diagonal no no just looks and colors so
if

60
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:00,640
if
 

61
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,070
if
how much does it have to kill

62
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:04,080
how much does it have to kill
 

63
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,789
how much does it have to kill
a person every time no no no i'm just

okay so what if they they can't
 

69
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,510
okay so what if they they can't
kill anybody on that turn how would they

70
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:13,520
kill anybody on that turn how would they
 

71
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,870
kill anybody on that turn how would they
move

72
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:14,880
move
 

73
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,630
move
good question okay we are not thinking

74
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:16,640
good question okay we are not thinking
 

75
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,870
good question okay we are not thinking
that far yet but today here

76
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:18,880
that far yet but today here

79
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,870
i am i'm asking you to play sixth place
six looks here because six times six and

80
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:24,880
six looks here because six times six and
 

81
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,310
six looks here because six times six and
there's six loops

82
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:26,320
there's six loops
 

83
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,350
there's six loops
and you can place it some other way here

84
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:29,360
and you can place it some other way here
 

85
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,310
and you can place it some other way here
like that so none of them can attach

86
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:32,320
like that so none of them can attach
 

87
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,069
like that so none of them can attach
each other

88
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:34,079
each other
 

89
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,550
each other
okay

90
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:38,560

 

91
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,870

how how can i place it here

92
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:42,880

 

93
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,830

here yeah but when you press here yeah

94
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:45,840
here yeah but when you press here yeah
 

95
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,590
here yeah but when you press here yeah
and then you can press here

96
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:47,600
and then you can press here
 

97
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,389
and then you can press here
you see so none of them can attach each

98
00:01:50,389 --> 00:01:50,399
you see so none of them can attach each
 

99
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:51,350
you see so none of them can attach each
other right

100
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:51,360
other right
 

101
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,149
other right
yeah yeah now why do you have to have

102

that's why yeah that's one possibility

114
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:07,280
that's why yeah that's one possibility
 

115
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,070
that's why yeah that's one possibility
so the question

116
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:08,080
so the question
 

117
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,110
so the question
is the given given n

118
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:11,120
is the given given n
 

119
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,710
is the given given n
looks on n times and n chair how many

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,790
looks on n times and n chair how many
possibilities how many ways we can put

122
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:16,800
possibilities how many ways we can put
 

123
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,430
possibilities how many ways we can put
them

172
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:19,360
answer soon yeah
 

173
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,550
answer soon yeah
wait let me check it out

174
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:24,560

 

175
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,949

okay i think it's something

176
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:28,959
okay i think it's something
 

177
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,390
okay i think it's something
how many ways after you imagine

178
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:32,400
how many ways after you imagine
 

179
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,990
how many ways after you imagine
uh okay

180
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,000
uh okay
 

181
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,710
uh okay
so how many ways let's be right yeah i

182
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:38,720
so how many ways let's be right yeah i
 

183
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,030
so how many ways let's be right yeah i
think

184
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:39,040
think
 

185
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,070
think
it's something nine eight eight eight

186
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:42,080
it's something nine eight eight eight
 

187
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,110
it's something nine eight eight eight
six i think about this bit and

188
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:47,120

 

189
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,910

what do you mean i think there's

190
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:49,920
what do you mean i think there's
 

191
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,270
what do you mean i think there's
something about

192
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:51,280
something about
 

193
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,309
something about
this line and this one yeah

194
00:03:54,309 --> 00:03:54,319
this line and this one yeah
 

195
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,030
this line and this one yeah
yeah one two three three three three

196
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,040
yeah one two three three three three
 

197
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,910
yeah one two three three three three
think about it

198
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:57,920
think about it
 

199
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,509
think about it
how many ways i can put here what

200
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:01,519
how many ways i can put here what
 

201
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:07,509
how many ways i can put here what
wait one two three

202
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:07,519

 

203
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,270

one okay okay so

204
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:11,280
one okay okay so
 

205
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,429
one okay okay so
first of all the looks cannot be in the

206
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:13,439
first of all the looks cannot be in the
 

207
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,869
first of all the looks cannot be in the
same row okay

208
00:04:14,869 --> 00:04:14,879
same row okay
 

209
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,509
same row okay
right yeah okay so let's put then how

210
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:17,519
right yeah okay so let's put then how
 

211
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,710
right yeah okay so let's put then how
many rows are in

212
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:18,720
many rows are in
 

213
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,990
many rows are in
n terms and just prompt

214
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:22,000
n terms and just prompt
 

215
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,749
n terms and just prompt
how many rows yeah okay so let's put it

216
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:25,759
how many rows yeah okay so let's put it
 

217
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,390
how many rows yeah okay so let's put it
let's try putting first here and i'm

218
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:28,400
let's try putting first here and i'm
 

219
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,110
let's try putting first here and i'm
putting seven

220
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:29,120
putting seven
 

221
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,990
putting seven
seconds here yeah row by row yeah yeah

222
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:32,000
seconds here yeah row by row yeah yeah
 

223
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,189
seconds here yeah row by row yeah yeah
if i put it here

224
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:33,199
if i put it here
 

225
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,350
if i put it here
how many ways i can put i can choose

226
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:35,360
how many ways i can put i can choose
 

227
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,950
how many ways i can put i can choose
from

228
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:36,960
from
 

229
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,150
from
in factorial where down yeah yeah

230
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,160
in factorial where down yeah yeah
 

231
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,390
in factorial where down yeah yeah
so you put the first one on n and then

232
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:42,400
so you put the first one on n and then
 

233
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,629
so you put the first one on n and then
the second choice is you have n minus

234
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:44,639
the second choice is you have n minus
 

235
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,430
the second choice is you have n minus
one right

236
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:45,440
one right
 

237
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,670
one right
and the third one you have one and minus

238
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:47,680
and the third one you have one and minus
 

239
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,790
and the third one you have one and minus
one

240
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:48,800
one
 

241
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,390
one
oh and here one so that's m that's it

242
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:52,400
oh and here one so that's m that's it
 

243
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,270
oh and here one so that's m that's it
you see easy yeah okay so let's review

244
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:55,280
you see easy yeah okay so let's review
 

245
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,790
you see easy yeah okay so let's review
this we talked about this on the first

246
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:56,800
this we talked about this on the first
 

247
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,790
this we talked about this on the first
day every question remember

248
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:58,800
day every question remember
 

249
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,230
day every question remember
yeah day one recursion yeah that was

250
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:02,240
yeah day one recursion yeah that was
 

251
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,029
yeah day one recursion yeah that was
like

252
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:03,039
like
 

253
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:07,350
like
that was like 190 days ago right

254
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:07,360
that was like 190 days ago right
 

255
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,510
that was like 190 days ago right
okay so how about we implement this

256
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:09,520
okay so how about we implement this
 

257
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,629
okay so how about we implement this
location f

258
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:10,639
location f
 

259
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,909
location f
f n if n

260
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:13,919
f n if n
 

261
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,270
f n if n
equals one

262
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:17,280

 

263
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,550

okay if n zero factorial is also one

264
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:20,560
okay if n zero factorial is also one
 

265
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,029
okay if n zero factorial is also one
okay

266
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:21,039
okay
 

267
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:26,150
okay
if n equals zero return

268
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:26,160
if n equals zero return
 

269
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,310
if n equals zero return
factory one then what return what

270
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:30,320
factory one then what return what
 

271
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,749
factory one then what return what
factorial n times n

272
00:05:33,749 --> 00:05:33,759
factorial n times n
 

273
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:39,110
factorial n times n
times what can i connect factorial and

274
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:39,120

 

275
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,629

how to implement this one

276
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:42,639

 

277
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,310

n factorial equals n times what

278
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:46,320
n factorial equals n times what
 

279
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,510
n factorial equals n times what
n times i

280
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:49,520
n times i
 

281
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,710
n times i
times n minus one

282
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:52,720
times n minus one
 

283
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,350
times n minus one
minus one times a minus two

284
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:57,360
minus one times a minus two
 

285
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,990
minus one times a minus two
t one okay so what's this bit what's

286
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,000
t one okay so what's this bit what's
 

287
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,430
t one okay so what's this bit what's
this bit this is

288
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:01,440
this bit this is
 

289
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,029
this bit this is
like i think it's like one no no

290
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:05,039
like i think it's like one no no
 

291
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,590
like i think it's like one no no
this bit is what m minus one factorial

292
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:07,600
this bit is what m minus one factorial
 

293
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,150
this bit is what m minus one factorial
right

294
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,160
right
 

295
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,189
right
yeah so n returns n times one

296
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:11,199
yeah so n returns n times one
 

297
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,550
yeah so n returns n times one
and minus one factorial okay which is

298
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:16,560
and minus one factorial okay which is
 

299
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,230
and minus one factorial okay which is
one

300
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:18,240
one
 

301
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,909
one
there's no vector that f n is n

302
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:19,919
there's no vector that f n is n
 

303
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,909
there's no vector that f n is n
factorial so e equals n times

304
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:21,919
factorial so e equals n times
 

305
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:29,909
factorial so e equals n times
f and minus one right okay okay

306
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:29,919

 

307
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,309

we can do this with uh iterator really

308
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:32,319
we can do this with uh iterator really
 

309
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,590
we can do this with uh iterator really
okay so look

310
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:33,600
okay so look
 

311
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,350
okay so look
answer equals 1 4 i

312
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:37,360
answer equals 1 4 i
 

313
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,710
answer equals 1 4 i

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,150
we don't need to reinvent the wheel we
can return math

340
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:51,160
can return math
 

341
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:56,710
can return math
factorial factor and

342
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:56,720

 

343
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,990

that's it okay so we have already have a

344
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:00,000
that's it okay so we have already have a
 

345
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,510
that's it okay so we have already have a
function to calculate m

346
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:01,520
function to calculate m
 

347
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,830
function to calculate m
zero using this function next of a clear

348
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:03,840
zero using this function next of a clear
 

349
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,270
zero using this function next of a clear
and easy

350
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:05,280
and easy
 

351
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,309
and easy
okay okay can you write this uh

352
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:08,319
okay okay can you write this uh
 

353
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,909
okay okay can you write this uh
can you write the previous one okay

354
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:09,919
can you write the previous one okay
 

355
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,029
can you write the previous one okay
answer equals one and then for

356
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:13,039
answer equals one and then for
 

357
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,990
answer equals one and then for
something for something something and

358
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:16,000
something for something something and
 

359
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,309
something for something something and
then do this return answer okay

360
00:08:18,309 --> 00:08:18,319
then do this return answer okay
 

361
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,390
then do this return answer okay
let me do this return another thingy

362
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:22,400

 

363
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:39,269

okay

364
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:39,279

 

365
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,720

i yeah and in what

366
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:42,730
i yeah and in what

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,030
okay in one
you want to i want to go from 2 to n

372
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,040
you want to i want to go from 2 to n
 

373
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,910
you want to i want to go from 2 to n
right so what's that function

374
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:55,920

 

375
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:06,829

you forgot the range come on run
