00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,669

hello hello

2
00:00:03,669 --> 00:00:03,679
hello hello
 

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:05,910
hello hello
okay so today we talk about the counter

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:05,920
okay so today we talk about the counter
 

5
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:06,710
okay so today we talk about the counter
remember

6
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:06,720
remember
 

7
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,270
remember
the counter thing in python you have

8
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:09,280
the counter thing in python you have
 

9
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,589
the counter thing in python you have
counter things what's counter

10
00:00:11,589 --> 00:00:11,599
counter things what's counter
 

11
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,270
counter things what's counter
culture data so this counter data

12
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:15,280
culture data so this counter data
 

13
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,070
culture data so this counter data
returns a

14
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:16,080
returns a
 

15
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,950
returns a
key value pairs for for the unique items

16
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:18,960
key value pairs for for the unique items
 

17
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,230
key value pairs for for the unique items
in data for example like beta if data

18
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:22,240
in data for example like beta if data
 

19
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,509
in data for example like beta if data
is a b b

20
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:25,519
is a b b
 

21
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,390
is a b b
a c okay so this counter object will

22
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:28,400
a c okay so this counter object will
 

23
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,070
a c okay so this counter object will
return the dictionary

24
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:30,080
return the dictionary
 

25
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,709
return the dictionary
which is a key value pair so this

26
00:00:32,709 --> 00:00:32,719
which is a key value pair so this
 

27
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:33,510
which is a key value pair so this
generally yeah

28
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:33,520
generally yeah
 

29
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,630
generally yeah
a curly brace so a

30
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:36,640
a curly brace so a
 

31
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,470
a curly brace so a
this is the key which is the unique

32
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:38,480
this is the key which is the unique
 

33
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,310
this is the key which is the unique
items and how many times are they appear

34
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:40,320
items and how many times are they appear
 

35
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,150
items and how many times are they appear
they appear two times

36
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:42,160
they appear two times
 

37
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,430
they appear two times
b appear two

38
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:45,440
b appear two
 

39
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,790
b appear two
two times c appear one yeah

40
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:48,800
two times c appear one yeah
 

41
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,750
two times c appear one yeah
curly brace okay so now today we if we

42
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:51,760
curly brace okay so now today we if we
 

43
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,790
curly brace okay so now today we if we
want to implement this counter object

44
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:54,800
want to implement this counter object
 

45
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,950
want to implement this counter object
so let's implement it okay let's say

46
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:56,960
so let's implement it okay let's say
 

47
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,310
so let's implement it okay let's say
define

48
00:00:58,310 --> 00:00:58,320
define
 

49
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,590
define
counter island data

50
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:03,600
counter island data
 

51
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,149
counter island data
okay so then this data can be a string

52
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:06,159
okay so then this data can be a string
 

53
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:06,710
okay so then this data can be a string
or

54
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:06,720
or
 

55
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,830
or
a list or anything that

56
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:09,840
a list or anything that
 

57
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,789
a list or anything that
that's iterable right it's a iterable

58
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:12,799
that's iterable right it's a iterable
 

59
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:13,350
that's iterable right it's a iterable
what's mean

60
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:13,360
what's mean
 

61
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,270
what's mean
integral means that you can do this for

62
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:15,280
integral means that you can do this for
 

63
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,109
integral means that you can do this for
i in data thing right

64
00:01:17,109 --> 00:01:17,119
i in data thing right
 

65
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,950
i in data thing right
so by the beginning we need to define

66
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:18,960
so by the beginning we need to define
 

67
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,630
so by the beginning we need to define
the return

68
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:20,640
the return
 

69
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,830
the return
data which is a dictionary before

70
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:24,840
data which is a dictionary before
 

71
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,230
data which is a dictionary before
dictionary

72
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:26,240
dictionary
 

73
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,590
dictionary
before dictionary int

74
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:29,600
before dictionary int
 

75
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,109
before dictionary int
this in test tells that that the

76
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:33,119
this in test tells that that the
 

77
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,310
this in test tells that that the
value the value type is a integer

78
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:36,320
value the value type is a integer
 

79
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,830
value the value type is a integer
and by default if the item is the item

80
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:39,840
and by default if the item is the item
 

81
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,469
and by default if the item is the item
the key

82
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:40,479
the key
 

83
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,710
the key
is not existing in the dictionary the

84
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:42,720
is not existing in the dictionary the
 

85
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,630
is not existing in the dictionary the
value will be zero

86
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:44,640
value will be zero
 

87
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,630
value will be zero
the value will be zero okay so now we

88
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:46,640
the value will be zero okay so now we
 

89
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,230
the value will be zero okay so now we
want to iterate

90
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:48,240
want to iterate
 

91
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,149
want to iterate
we want to iterate over the data so we

92
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:50,159
we want to iterate over the data so we
 

93
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,670
we want to iterate over the data so we
use the for for

94
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:51,680
use the for for
 

95
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,870
use the for for
i in data so that we go through each

96
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:54,880
i in data so that we go through each
 

97
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,510
i in data so that we go through each
item

98
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:55,520
item
 

99
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,749
item
each item will be character or the list

100
00:01:57,749 --> 00:01:57,759
each item will be character or the list
 

101
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:58,950
each item will be character or the list
or the number in the list

102
00:01:58,950 --> 00:01:58,960
or the number in the list
 

103
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,109
or the number in the list
or anything element in the list and then

104
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:01,119
or anything element in the list and then
 

105
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,950
or anything element in the list and then
now we want to reference the

106
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:02,960
now we want to reference the
 

107
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,389
now we want to reference the
we want to reference the value right so

108
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:06,399
we want to reference the value right so
 

109
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,990
we want to reference the value right so
how do we reference the value answer

110
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,000
how do we reference the value answer
 

111
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,190
how do we reference the value answer
square bracket i want to put here

112
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:13,200
square bracket i want to put here
 

113

i right and then if we want to eat

116
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:20,480
i right and then if we want to eat
 

117
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,510
i right and then if we want to eat
if we want to increment by one

118
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:23,520
if we want to increment by one
 

119
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,030
if we want to increment by one
so how do we produce it plus equal one

120
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:27,040
so how do we produce it plus equal one
 

121
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,990
so how do we produce it plus equal one
plus equal one where down and then i

122
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,000
plus equal one where down and then i
 

123
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,670
plus equal one where down and then i
lost we want to return this
