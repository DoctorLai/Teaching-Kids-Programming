list
 

7
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,190
list
yeah one two five

8
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:11,200
yeah one two five
 

9
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,990
yeah one two five
seven nine okay and now i will give you

10
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:14,000
seven nine okay and now i will give you
 

11
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,190
seven nine okay and now i will give you
another list

12
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:15,200
another list
 

13
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,630
another list
another list this is one list let's call

14
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:18,640
another list this is one list let's call
 

15
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,750
another list this is one list let's call
it a

16
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:19,760
it a
 

17
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,189
it a
another list which is two

18
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:23,199
another list which is two
 

19
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,470
another list which is two
one nine seven

20
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:26,480
one nine seven
 

21
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,509
one nine seven
five okay

22
00:00:29,509 --> 00:00:29,519
five okay
 

23
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,709
five okay
so now the touch is that

24
00:00:32,709 --> 00:00:32,719
so now the touch is that
 

25
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,069
so now the touch is that
this is the the original list

26
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:36,079
this is the the original list
 

27
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,630
this is the the original list
and you can pick any sub list right

28
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:38,640
and you can pick any sub list right
 

29
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,750
and you can pick any sub list right
which is subject

30
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:39,760
which is subject
 

31
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:47,270
which is subject
continuous sub list right so can we

32
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:47,280

 

33
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,189

and then you can reverse the sub list

34
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:51,199
and then you can reverse the sub list
 

35
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,830
and then you can reverse the sub list
as many times as you want okay reverse

36
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:53,840
as many times as you want okay reverse
 

37
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,869
as many times as you want okay reverse
it

38
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:54,879
it
 

39
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,150
it
as many times as you want as many times

40
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:58,160
as many times as you want as many times
 

41
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,510
as many times as you want as many times
as you want

42
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:01,520

 

43
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,750

and then you have to make the same where

44
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:03,760
and then you have to make the same where
 

45
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,950
and then you have to make the same where
them well

46
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:04,960
them well
 

47
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,710
them well
you see this is going and can you make

48
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:06,720
you see this is going and can you make
 

49
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,469
you see this is going and can you make
these to this so what if

50
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:08,479
these to this so what if
 

51
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,350
these to this so what if

53
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,429
you can't if you can't then you'll
determine fourth if you can then you

54
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:13,439
determine fourth if you can then you
 

55
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,590
determine fourth if you can then you
tell me it's yes um you switch

71
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,109

remember reverse sublist as many times

72
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:45,119
remember reverse sublist as many times
 

73
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,590
remember reverse sublist as many times
as you want

74
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:49,600

 

75

how can we solve this problem we learn
 

99
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:26,790
how can we solve this problem we learn
something

100
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:26,800
something

a number to the end or to any number
position

112
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:40,560
position
 

113
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,830
position
how hot how would you do it how would

114

00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:50,239
to move these 9 knives
 

121
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,869
to move these 9 knives
to the end you need to um

122
00:02:54,869 --> 00:02:54,879
to the end you need to um
 

123
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,990
to the end you need to um
and move it yeah and you do

124
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,000
and move it yeah and you do
 

125
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,070
and move it yeah and you do
the whole thing opposite okay and how

126
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,080
the whole thing opposite okay and how
 

127
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,110
the whole thing opposite okay and how
about moving here

128
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:03,120

 

129
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,949

and then it will be um seven one two

130
00:03:06,949 --> 00:03:06,959
and then it will be um seven one two
 

131
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,790
and then it will be um seven one two
five um and then you will need to switch

132
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:12,800
five um and then you will need to switch
 

133
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,830
five um and then you will need to switch
one one with seven and then you need to

134
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:16,840
one one with seven and then you need to
 

135
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,830
one one with seven and then you need to
yeah okay so if i tell you that

136
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:19,840
yeah okay so if i tell you that
 

137
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,830
yeah okay so if i tell you that
uh i just want to move knight

138
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:23,840
uh i just want to move knight
 

139
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,350
uh i just want to move knight
to the end but i don't want to catch any

140
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:27,360
to the end but i don't want to catch any
 

141
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,710
to the end but i don't want to catch any
orders of these

142
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:28,720
orders of these
 

143
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,589
orders of these
so these will be five two one so it will

144
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:31,599
so these will be five two one so it will
 

145
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,390
so these will be five two one so it will
be like

146
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:32,400
be like
 

147
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,430
be like
five two one seven nine okay so how how

148
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:35,440
five two one seven nine okay so how how
 

149
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,550
five two one seven nine okay so how how
would you do it

150
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:36,560
would you do it
 

151
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,589
would you do it
if you want me if i want to move this

152
00:03:39,589 --> 00:03:39,599
if you want me if i want to move this
 

153
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,190
if you want me if i want to move this
knight to the end without

154
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:41,200
knight to the end without
 

155
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,270
knight to the end without
changing the order of the other elements

156
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:43,280
changing the order of the other elements
 

157
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,830
changing the order of the other elements
it's five two one seven eight

158
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:45,840
it's five two one seven eight
 

159
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,470
it's five two one seven eight
how would you do it but can we change it

160
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:48,480
how would you do it but can we change it
 

161
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,710
how would you do it but can we change it
and then we put it back again

162
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:50,720
and then we put it back again
 

163
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,550
and then we put it back again
up to you i mean can you think about

164
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:52,560
up to you i mean can you think about

169
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,260
as many as terms as possible so how do
you do it

170
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:01,270
you do it
 

171
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:08,869
you do it
[Music]

172
00:04:08,869 --> 00:04:08,879

 

173
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,300

wait

174
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:13,310

 

175
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:16,949

[Music]

176
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:16,959

 

177
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,670

yeah think about it so the other

178
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:19,680
yeah think about it so the other
 

179
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,629
yeah think about it so the other
elements

180
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:20,639
elements
 

181
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,710
elements
won't change i just want to move this

182
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:22,720
won't change i just want to move this
 

183
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,230
won't change i just want to move this
together

184
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:26,240

 

185
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:35,430

and maybe

186
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:35,440

 

187
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,990

that's what i want so basically so i can

188
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:38,000
that's what i want so basically so i can
 

189
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,070
that's what i want so basically so i can
prove that i can move this element to

190
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,080
prove that i can move this element to
 

191
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,310
prove that i can move this element to
any positions i want right

192
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:42,320
any positions i want right
 

193
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,350
any positions i want right
right okay so the task becomes that to

194
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:45,360
right okay so the task becomes that to
 

195
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,870
right okay so the task becomes that to
check

196
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:46,880
check
 

197
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,390
check
if if it's possible to move any of these

198
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:50,400
if if it's possible to move any of these
 

199
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,950
if if it's possible to move any of these
to rearrange these

200
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:52,960
to rearrange these
 

201
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,710
to rearrange these
to the to the target

202
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:56,720
to the to the target
 

203
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,950
to the to the target
so in order for these to be become these

204
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:00,960
so in order for these to be become these
 

205
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,990
so in order for these to be become these
what kind of requirements does it do we

206
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:04,000
what kind of requirements does it do we
 

207
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,590
what kind of requirements does it do we
need to make sure these two arrays for

208
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:05,600
need to make sure these two arrays for
 

209
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,469
need to make sure these two arrays for
example

210
00:05:06,469 --> 00:05:06,479
example
 

211
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,230
example
these two array needs to have the same

212
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:08,240
these two array needs to have the same
 

213
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,510
these two array needs to have the same
length right

214
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:09,520
length right
 

215
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,469
length right
all right yeah that's that's one obvious

216
00:05:12,469 --> 00:05:12,479
all right yeah that's that's one obvious
 

217
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,150
all right yeah that's that's one obvious
yeah if it's different lens you can make

218
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,160
yeah if it's different lens you can make
 

219
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,270
yeah if it's different lens you can make
it right

220
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:15,280
it right
 

221
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,710
it right
okay so segments and how about

222
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:18,720
okay so segments and how about
 

223
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,469
okay so segments and how about
some lens how about if i have a minion

224
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:22,479
some lens how about if i have a minion
 

225
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:22,790
some lens how about if i have a minion
here

226
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:22,800
here
 

227
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,469
here
a hundred and this doesn't have a

228
00:05:24,469 --> 00:05:24,479
a hundred and this doesn't have a
 

229
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,550
a hundred and this doesn't have a
hundred does it can

230
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:26,560
hundred does it can
 

231
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,749
hundred does it can
can you change to the target

232
00:05:29,749 --> 00:05:29,759
can you change to the target
 

233
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,310
can you change to the target
the elements needs to be the same right

234
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:34,320
the elements needs to be the same right
 

235
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,830
the elements needs to be the same right
look if i have a 15 here i don't have 15

236
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:36,840
look if i have a 15 here i don't have 15
 

237
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,990
look if i have a 15 here i don't have 15
here

238
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:38,000
here
 

239
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,749
here
can you change from a to b

240
00:05:41,749 --> 00:05:41,759
can you change from a to b
 

241
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,230
can you change from a to b
so if one of the elements is not found

242
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:44,240
so if one of the elements is not found
 

243
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,430
so if one of the elements is not found
in another

244
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:45,440
in another
 

245
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,749
in another
if one of element is not found in other

246
00:05:47,749 --> 00:05:47,759
if one of element is not found in other
 

247
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:48,629
if one of element is not found in other
list

248
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:48,639
list
 

249
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,710
list
what happens can you change

250
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:52,720
what happens can you change
 

251
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,870
what happens can you change
no you cannot change right so for

252
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:54,880
no you cannot change right so for
 

253
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,830
no you cannot change right so for
example 15.

254
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:55,840
example 15.
 

255
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,550
example 15.
no matter how you swap reverse you can't

256
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:58,560
no matter how you swap reverse you can't
 

257
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,230
no matter how you swap reverse you can't
make it the target right because the

258
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:00,240
make it the target right because the
 

259
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,790
make it the target right because the
target doesn't contain the 15. all right

260
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:02,800
target doesn't contain the 15. all right
 

261
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,870
target doesn't contain the 15. all right
yes hey okay so what kind of thing what

262
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:06,880
yes hey okay so what kind of thing what
 

263
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,110
yes hey okay so what kind of thing what
kind of characteristic these two need

264
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:09,120
kind of characteristic these two need
 

265
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,749
kind of characteristic these two need
already needs to be remember we talk

266
00:06:11,749 --> 00:06:11,759
already needs to be remember we talk
 

267
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,830
already needs to be remember we talk
about

268
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:13,840
about
 

269
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,150
about
you know check checking two strings if

270
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:16,160
you know check checking two strings if
 

271
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,189
you know check checking two strings if
they are

272
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:17,199
they are
 

273
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,909
they are
what the same they are the same after

274
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:19,919
what the same they are the same after
 

275
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,189
what the same they are the same after
the arrangement what do we call it

276
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:23,199
the arrangement what do we call it
 

277
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,909
the arrangement what do we call it
what do you call it like what do you

278
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:25,919
what do you call it like what do you
 

279
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,590
what do you call it like what do you
mean

280
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:27,600
mean
 

281
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,590
mean
you know you know what i'm talking about

282
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:29,600
you know you know what i'm talking about
 

283
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,870
you know you know what i'm talking about
like um

284
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:32,880

 

285
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:47,830

like

286
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:47,840

 

287
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,350

okay so what's underground um is when

288
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:51,360
okay so what's underground um is when
 

289
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,950
okay so what's underground um is when
if you got the same amount of letters um

290
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:54,960
if you got the same amount of letters um
 

291
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,629
if you got the same amount of letters um
same um

292
00:06:58,629 --> 00:06:58,639
same um
 

293
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,629
same um
same character in each word and

294
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:02,639
same character in each word and
 

295
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,710
same character in each word and
certain frequency for each character

296
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:04,720
certain frequency for each character
 

297
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,150
certain frequency for each character
okay so basically we are checking the

298
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:06,160
okay so basically we are checking the
 

299
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,350
okay so basically we are checking the
same

300
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:07,360
same
 

301
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,110
same
same so these the length needs to be

302
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:09,120
same so these the length needs to be
 

303
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,110
same so these the length needs to be
same each number needs to be the same

304
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:11,120
same each number needs to be the same
 

305
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,670
same each number needs to be the same
number

306
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:11,680
number
 

307
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,510
number
if they are okay they are

308
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:15,520
if they are okay they are
 

309
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,629
if they are okay they are
two two twos and

310
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:18,639
two two twos and
 

311
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,510
two two twos and
here needs to be two twos right yeah all

312
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:21,520
here needs to be two twos right yeah all
 

313
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,469
here needs to be two twos right yeah all
right

314
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:22,479
right
 

315
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,150
right
let's one seven here needs to be one

316
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:24,160
let's one seven here needs to be one
 

317
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,029
let's one seven here needs to be one
seven okay and hopefully we check if the

318
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:27,039
seven okay and hopefully we check if the
 

319
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,589
seven okay and hopefully we check if the
energon do you still remember instead of

320
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:29,599
energon do you still remember instead of
 

321
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,909
energon do you still remember instead of
energon we're checking the underground

322
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:31,919
energon we're checking the underground
 

323
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,390
energon we're checking the underground
of the list of two lists right so how

324
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:34,400
of the list of two lists right so how
 

325
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,189
of the list of two lists right so how
can we check it

326
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:35,199
can we check it
 

327
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,469
can we check it
to to these uh endograms huh

328
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:38,479
to to these uh endograms huh
 

329
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,309
to to these uh endograms huh
so basically we are checking the least

330
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:40,319
so basically we are checking the least
 

331
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,710
so basically we are checking the least
energy how can we check it

332
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:42,720
energy how can we check it
 

333
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,909
energy how can we check it
define let's just check okay let's list

334
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:45,919
define let's just check okay let's list
 

335
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,990
define let's just check okay let's list
a and b hey hey wait i think i got

336
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:50,000
a and b hey hey wait i think i got
 

337
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,029
a and b hey hey wait i think i got
it it might not work okay so what how do

338
00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:53,039
it it might not work okay so what how do
 

339
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,390
it it might not work okay so what how do
you check if two

340
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:54,400
you check if two
 

341
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,990
you check if two
array or two string i don't know we

342
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:56,000
array or two string i don't know we
 

343
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,150
array or two string i don't know we
talked about this before right i know i

344
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:58,160
talked about this before right i know i
 

345
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:58,550
talked about this before right i know i
know

346
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:58,560
know
 

347
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,029
know
wait wait i know how to solve a problem

348
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:01,039
wait wait i know how to solve a problem
 

349
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,550
wait wait i know how to solve a problem
you're talking about

350
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:02,560
you're talking about
 

351
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,950
you're talking about
um say before and um so basically

352
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:06,960
um say before and um so basically
 

353
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,070
um say before and um so basically
you just check if if they have the same

354
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,080
you just check if if they have the same
 

355
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,029
you just check if if they have the same
amount

356
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:11,039
amount
 

357
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,950
amount
or and they have the same amount of

358
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:12,960
or and they have the same amount of
 

359
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,230
or and they have the same amount of
character and

360
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:14,240
character and
 

361
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,390
character and
if if it doesn't have any and if it has

362
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:18,400
if if it doesn't have any and if it has
 

363
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,029
if if it doesn't have any and if it has
and if it's and you can just pretend

364
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:21,039
and if it's and you can just pretend
 

365
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,070
and if it's and you can just pretend
tree if

366
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:22,080
tree if
 

367
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,270
tree if
all of them that is okay

368
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:25,280
all of them that is okay
 

369
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,550
all of them that is okay
okay so first of all we don't want to

370
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:26,560
okay so first of all we don't want to
 

371
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,390
okay so first of all we don't want to
check it valence yeah if length

372
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:28,400
check it valence yeah if length
 

373
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,389
check it valence yeah if length
a not equals length b

374
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:32,399
a not equals length b
 

375
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,110
a not equals length b
then what should we do return

376
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:37,120

 

377
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,190

if the lengths are different the force

378
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:39,200
if the lengths are different the force
 

379
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,269
if the lengths are different the force
yeah let's let's sense for the endogram

380
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:41,279
yeah let's let's sense for the endogram
 

381
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:41,750
yeah let's let's sense for the endogram
yeah

382
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:41,760
yeah
 

383
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,509
yeah
if the two strings are different size

384
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:43,519
if the two strings are different size
 

385
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,269
if the two strings are different size
they come to the end one right

386
00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:45,279
they come to the end one right
 

387
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,350
they come to the end one right
yeah that's not possible right all right

388
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:49,360
yeah that's not possible right all right
 

389
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,310
yeah that's not possible right all right
yeah okay now so how can we check if two

390
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:52,320
yeah okay now so how can we check if two
 

391
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,750
yeah okay now so how can we check if two
strings are undergone it's

392
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:53,760
strings are undergone it's
 

393
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,750
strings are undergone it's
basically the same how can we check if

394
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:55,760
basically the same how can we check if
 

395
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,750
basically the same how can we check if
the two strings are underground

396
00:08:59,750 --> 00:08:59,760

 

397
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,030

um we can

398
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,040
um we can
 

399
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,269
um we can
first of all we can do what we can do

400
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:05,279
first of all we can do what we can do
 

401
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,230
first of all we can do what we can do
this

402
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:06,240
this
 

403
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,470
this
this thing in o and locker n how can we

404
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:08,480
this thing in o and locker n how can we
 

405
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,750
this thing in o and locker n how can we
do this so

406
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:09,760
do this so
 

407
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,670
do this so
yeah we can sort it yeah if we sort it

408
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:11,680
yeah we can sort it yeah if we sort it
 

409
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,070
yeah we can sort it yeah if we sort it
what happened

410
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:14,080
what happened
 

411
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,750
what happened
that would be the same yeah exactly

412
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:15,760
that would be the same yeah exactly
 

413
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,630
that would be the same yeah exactly
return how can we solve it so okay we

414
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:18,640
return how can we solve it so okay we
 

415
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,190
return how can we solve it so okay we
just say

416
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:19,200
just say
 

417
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:29,430
just say
sorted a

418
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:29,440

 

419
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:35,509

yeah okay what's the time complexity

420
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:35,519

 

421
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,870

what's the space complexity

422
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:38,880
what's the space complexity
 

423
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,750
what's the space complexity
okay another thing is that remember we

424
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:41,760
okay another thing is that remember we
 

425
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,630
okay another thing is that remember we
talked about

426
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:42,640
talked about
 

427
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,790
talked about
the one style we see the notebook what's

428
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:44,800
the one style we see the notebook what's
 

429
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,630
the one style we see the notebook what's
that remember i thought i used that a

430
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:46,640
that remember i thought i used that a
 

431
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,829
that remember i thought i used that a
lot to cut

432
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:47,839
lot to cut
 

433
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,110
lot to cut
counter yeah we count if we use the

434
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:51,120
counter yeah we count if we use the
 

435
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,670
counter yeah we count if we use the
counter

436
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:51,680
counter
 

437
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,430
counter
a then look if this is one two okay

438
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:55,440
a then look if this is one two okay
 

439
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,509
a then look if this is one two okay
and another one is two one okay so what

440
00:09:57,509 --> 00:09:57,519
and another one is two one okay so what
 

441
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,750
and another one is two one okay so what
counter a

442
00:09:59,750 --> 00:09:59,760
counter a
 

443
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,670
counter a
what does counter a give us it will give

444
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:01,680
what does counter a give us it will give
 

445
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,269
what does counter a give us it will give
us this one one

446
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:05,279
us this one one
 

447
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,150
us this one one
two one yeah two appears one time one

448
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:08,160
two one yeah two appears one time one
 

449
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:08,949
two one yeah two appears one time one
appear one

450
00:10:08,949 --> 00:10:08,959
appear one
 

451
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,990
appear one
yeah and here comes the p

452
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:12,000
yeah and here comes the p
 

453
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,509
yeah and here comes the p
what does z equal

454
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:15,519

 

455
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,550

one one two one right so they are the

456
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:18,560
one one two one right so they are the
 

457
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,430
one one two one right so they are the
same right

458
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:19,440
same right
 

459
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,550
same right
yeah so i can replace salty with

460
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:22,560
yeah so i can replace salty with
 

461
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,829
yeah so i can replace salty with
what you want

462
00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:25,839

 

463
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,269

let's just tell you come on yeah counter

464
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:29,279
let's just tell you come on yeah counter
 

465
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,069
let's just tell you come on yeah counter
filter just replace it with another i

466
00:10:32,069 --> 00:10:32,079
filter just replace it with another i
 

467
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,150
filter just replace it with another i
like to put sorted

468
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:34,160
like to put sorted
 

469
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,030
like to put sorted
wait powder if you counter what's the

470
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:37,040
wait powder if you counter what's the
 

471
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,670
wait powder if you counter what's the
time complexity

472
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:41,680

 

473
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,430

yeah what's the space complexity

474
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:45,440

 

475
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,150

oh and okay so which one is better this

476
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:48,160
oh and okay so which one is better this
 

477
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,190
oh and okay so which one is better this
one is

478
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:49,200
one is
 

479
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,710
one is
which one is faster which one is faster

480
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:52,720
which one is faster which one is faster
 

481
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,069
which one is faster which one is faster
counter or sorted this one has a one

482
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:56,079
counter or sorted this one has a one
 

483
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,269
counter or sorted this one has a one
this one has

484
00:10:57,269 --> 00:10:57,279
this one has
 

485
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,790
this one has
this one yeah yeah which one is faster

486
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:00,800
this one yeah yeah which one is faster
 

487
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,550
this one yeah yeah which one is faster
counter or sorted counter is oven

488
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:04,560
counter or sorted counter is oven
 

489
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,949
counter or sorted counter is oven
sorted is always again come on that's

490
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:06,959
sorted is always again come on that's
 

491
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,710
sorted is always again come on that's
really obvious which one is faster

492
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:10,720

 

493
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,829

oh and pick o n o o n again

494
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:15,839
oh and pick o n o o n again
 

495
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,829
oh and pick o n o o n again
this one is bigger this one is smaller

496
00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:17,839
this one is bigger this one is smaller
 

497
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,430
this one is bigger this one is smaller
yeah so this one is faster yeah

498
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:19,440
yeah so this one is faster yeah
 

499
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,750
yeah so this one is faster yeah
then what's about the space okay space

500
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:21,760
then what's about the space okay space
 

501
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,430
then what's about the space okay space
we're trying to use the more space

502
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:23,440
we're trying to use the more space
 

503
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,430
we're trying to use the more space
different yeah because this one one is

504
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:25,440
different yeah because this one one is
 

505
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,030
different yeah because this one one is
constant this one okay so there the

506
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,040
constant this one okay so there the
 

507
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,990
constant this one okay so there the
chase

508
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,000
chase
 

509
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,829
chase
trade-off yeah you have your balance

510
00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:29,839
trade-off yeah you have your balance
 

511
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,509
trade-off yeah you have your balance
yeah it depends on

512
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:31,519
yeah it depends on
 

513
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,190
yeah it depends on
what you want yeah you see we're just

514
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:33,200
what you want yeah you see we're just
 

515
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,110
what you want yeah you see we're just
changing one keyword from counter to

516
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:35,120
changing one keyword from counter to
 

517
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,150
changing one keyword from counter to
salty

518
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:36,160
salty
 

519
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,949
salty
this one is faster no no no oh and

520
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:38,959
this one is faster no no no oh and
 

521
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:39,430
this one is faster no no no oh and
nothing

522
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:39,440
nothing
 

523
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,190
nothing
although oh and looking bigger than this

524
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:41,200
although oh and looking bigger than this
 

525
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,350
although oh and looking bigger than this
one if it's bigger the complexity is

526
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:43,360
one if it's bigger the complexity is
 

527
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,630
one if it's bigger the complexity is
bigger than

528
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:44,640
bigger than
 

529
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,350
bigger than
then it's slower if it's smaller right

530
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:47,360
then it's slower if it's smaller right
 

531
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,590
then it's slower if it's smaller right
if it's a one it's faster right than one

532
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:49,600
if it's a one it's faster right than one
 

533
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,030
if it's a one it's faster right than one
right remember we talk about

534
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:51,040
right remember we talk about
 

535
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,750
right remember we talk about
complexity the slower number the smaller

536
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:53,760
complexity the slower number the smaller
 

537
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,829
complexity the slower number the smaller
number

538
00:11:54,829 --> 00:11:54,839
number
 

539
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,860
number
means

540
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:56,870
means
 

541
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:01,350
means
[Music]

542
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:01,360

 

543
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,230

no matter how big of this number these

544
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:04,240
no matter how big of this number these
 

545
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,350
no matter how big of this number these
arrangements i mean

546
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:05,360
arrangements i mean
 

547
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,269
arrangements i mean
what's the difference but now i mean

548
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:07,279
what's the difference but now i mean
 

549
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,829
what's the difference but now i mean
what's the

550
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:08,839
what's the
 

551
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:12,790
what's the
what what's the difference between

552
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:12,800
what what's the difference between
 

553
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:18,629
what what's the difference between
a one and o n or

554
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:18,639

 

555
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,590

what come on i didn't know so what's

556
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:21,600
what come on i didn't know so what's
 

557
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,790
what come on i didn't know so what's
your question

558
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:22,800
your question
 

559
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,990
your question
look look i'm writing a table here okay

560
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:26,000
look look i'm writing a table here okay
 

561
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,190
look look i'm writing a table here okay
so here that's time

562
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:31,200
so here that's time
 

563
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,790
so here that's time
let's space okay if we are using

564
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:34,800
let's space okay if we are using
 

565
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,269
let's space okay if we are using
using the counter we using assorted

566
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:39,279
using the counter we using assorted
 

567
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,310
using the counter we using assorted
so this one time is o-n

568
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:42,320
so this one time is o-n
 

569
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,509
so this one time is o-n
space is

570
00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:45,519
space is
 

571
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:50,150
space is
all right sorted time is o

572
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:50,160
all right sorted time is o
 

573
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,069
all right sorted time is o
yeah space is i want okay

574
00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:54,079
yeah space is i want okay
 

575
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,710
yeah space is i want okay
so this one sorted is slower but use

576
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:56,720
so this one sorted is slower but use
 

577
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,269
so this one sorted is slower but use
less

578
00:12:57,269 --> 00:12:57,279
less
 

579
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,030
less
space memory counter is faster but use

580
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,040
space memory counter is faster but use
 

581
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,230
space memory counter is faster but use
more

582
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:02,240
more
 

583
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,590
more
space okay okay so

584
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:05,600
space okay okay so
 

585
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,350
space okay okay so
the lower this complexity the lower

586
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:09,360
the lower this complexity the lower
 

587
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,870
the lower this complexity the lower
the better for both time and space

588
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:12,880
the better for both time and space
 

589
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,430
the better for both time and space
it will be great if both time and space

590
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:15,440
it will be great if both time and space
 

591
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,230
it will be great if both time and space
is a one

592
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:16,240
is a one
 

593
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,230
is a one
what does it mean online constant means

594
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:18,240
what does it mean online constant means
 

595
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,790
what does it mean online constant means
that no matter how many elements if this

596
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:20,800
that no matter how many elements if this
 

597
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,629
that no matter how many elements if this
anime is a minion

598
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:22,639
anime is a minion
 

599
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,190
anime is a minion
it doesn't matter we spell one instant

600
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:25,200
it doesn't matter we spell one instant
 

601
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:25,990
it doesn't matter we spell one instant
fast

602
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:26,000
fast
 

603
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,870
fast
oh and remember we talk about y equals x

604
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:28,880
oh and remember we talk about y equals x
 

605
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,590
oh and remember we talk about y equals x
yes

606
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:29,600
yes
 

607
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,550
yes
the other day yeah y equals so what does

608
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:32,560
the other day yeah y equals so what does
 

609
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,230
the other day yeah y equals so what does
it mean here

610
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:34,240
it mean here
 

611
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,509
it mean here
the n is here this is y equals x

612
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:37,519
the n is here this is y equals x
 

613
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:45,030
the n is here this is y equals x
right all right and what's y equals 1

614
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:45,040

 

615
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,110

which line is can you draw y equals 1

616
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:47,120
which line is can you draw y equals 1
 

617
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,509
which line is can you draw y equals 1
here

618
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:49,519
here
 

619
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,870
here
come on i think it's something like

620
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:52,880
come on i think it's something like
 

621
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,310
come on i think it's something like
this yeah yeah because y this is y right

622
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:56,320
this yeah yeah because y this is y right
 

623
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,590
this yeah yeah because y this is y right
this is x this is we call it n okay

624
00:13:59,590 --> 00:13:59,600
this is x this is we call it n okay
 

625
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,790
this is x this is we call it n okay
look x is n equals

626
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:02,800
look x is n equals
 

627
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,910
look x is n equals
no matter how many n how many animals

628
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:05,920
no matter how many n how many animals
 

629
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,230
no matter how many n how many animals
is still one this is constant this is

630
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:08,240
is still one this is constant this is
 

631
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,470
is still one this is constant this is
constant okay this is constant

632
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:10,480
constant okay this is constant
 

633
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,470
constant okay this is constant
less linear linear o o n

634
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:14,480
less linear linear o o n
 

635
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,230
less linear linear o o n
log n i don't know how it's wrong but it

636
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:16,240
log n i don't know how it's wrong but it
 

637
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,509
log n i don't know how it's wrong but it
will be o

638
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:17,519
will be o
 

639
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,629
will be o
o n square yeah one

640
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:20,639
o n square yeah one
 

641
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,670
o n square yeah one
n is one you'll be one when n is two

642
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:23,680
n is one you'll be one when n is two
 

643
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,470
n is one you'll be one when n is two
you'll be four

644
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:24,480
you'll be four
 

645
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,230
you'll be four
so you'll be you'll be something like

646
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:26,240
so you'll be you'll be something like
 

647
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,629
so you'll be you'll be something like
that okay

648
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:28,639
that okay
 

649
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,949
that okay
so look if n is armenia you'll be from

650
00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:30,959
so look if n is armenia you'll be from
 

651
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:31,990
so look if n is armenia you'll be from
the highest like

652
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:32,000
the highest like
 

653
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,110
the highest like
this so when it's like this it's like

654
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:35,120
this so when it's like this it's like
 

655
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,389
this so when it's like this it's like
why is it still two no no i'm just

656
00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:38,399
why is it still two no no i'm just
 

657
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,230
why is it still two no no i'm just
just drawing something like that so told

658
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:40,240
just drawing something like that so told
 

659
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,310
just drawing something like that so told
you before it's really you'll be nice

660
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:42,320
you before it's really you'll be nice
 

661
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,430
you before it's really you'll be nice
you're going very slow very

662
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:45,440
you're going very slow very
 

663
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,110
you're going very slow very
well wrist what you call this slow yeah

664
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:49,120
well wrist what you call this slow yeah
 

665
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,949
well wrist what you call this slow yeah
very very high steep yeah steep

666
00:14:52,949 --> 00:14:52,959

okay the constant is no matter how big a
 

669
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,069
okay the constant is no matter how big a
median

670
00:14:56,069 --> 00:14:56,079
median
 

671
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,189
median
n is there one okay we love this kind of

672
00:14:59,189 --> 00:14:59,199
n is there one okay we love this kind of
 

673

solution yeah
 

675
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,350
solution yeah
it doesn't the number of the the the

676
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:03,360
it doesn't the number of the the the
 

677
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,990
it doesn't the number of the the the
the number of the input the scale of the

678
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:06,000
the number of the input the scale of the
 

679
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,310
the number of the input the scale of the
input doesn't impact the resolution

680
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:08,320
input doesn't impact the resolution
 

681
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,790
input doesn't impact the resolution
right correct does it make sense yeah

682
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:10,800
right correct does it make sense yeah
 

683
