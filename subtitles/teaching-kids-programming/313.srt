1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,559
okay so today we talk about divine

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,960
encounter yeah this is this concept is

3
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:14,240
not new yeah we have talked about this

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,880
before right yeah do you still remember

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,520
what problems uh have we used this kind

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,520
of strategy this is kind of like a

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,039
you know strategy that we solve the

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,880
problem

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,480
remember a few days ago we talked about

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:30,640
uh hanoi tower yeah hanoi tower remember

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,000
hanoi tower

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,920
yeah

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
we want to move this

14
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,040
the the

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,960
a b the disc from a to c yeah

16
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,200
so what does it include the divide and

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,360
conquer so we need to divide this into

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,680
three steps first

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,120
move the n minus one

20
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,199
this

21
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,000
from a

22
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:55,280
to

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,960
b right and then move the elastics and

24
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,559
from a to

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,239
c and then

26
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:04,720
the third step is moving the n minus one

27
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,799
this from b to c okay let's divide the

28
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,200
concept

29
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:13,119
so and also we talked about the merge

30
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,960
source remember merge sort yeah so given

31
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,759
a few numbers yeah given a few number

32
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,640
three two five one five

33
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,520
nine ten we want to solve sort of this

34
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:27,360
how can we imagine multistory

35
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,799
first of all we divide divide the to

36
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,040
sort it to solve the numbers in

37
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,560
ascending order first of all we divide

38
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,720
this into half

39
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,119
and we saw these two yeah

40
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,840
so look this is one two three and then

41
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:42,320
this is five nine

42
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:44,799
ten yeah everyone look look at me and

43
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,920
then once we saw the post part we merge

44
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,560
it

45
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,759
right right get it so let's divide uh

46
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:54,880
divide and conquer so what does it mean

47
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:58,960
can you from these two uh two examples

48
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,960
what does the meaning divide and conquer

49
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,920
i think it's like you divide it like

50
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,920
this

51
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,840
yeah solve it so they conquered conga

52
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:13,200
what's the conga mean like i

53
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,800
can't get new stuff i know i mean and

54
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,360
solve stuff

55
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,640
yeah yeah most likely okay so divide and

56
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,400
conquer is that

57
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,120
every time you know uh so divide and

58
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,640
conquer so usually we use the recursion

59
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,720
right so we can

60
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,959
recursively divide this problem into a

61
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,519
few you know not just two maybe a few

62
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:34,000
sub problems right divide this is the

63
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,680
divisor a big problem a very big problem

64
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,400
we divide it into

65
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,800
more right two or more problems

66
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,440
and then we recursively solve it solve

67
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,519
each part each small part right

68
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,680
and then what's next

69
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,239
once we solve it we use these results

70
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,760
from the smaller part to merge right to

71
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,720
get a bigger path right

72
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,599
right

73
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,800
yeah

74
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,519
okay so

75
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,080
what let's let's take an example okay

76
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,480
let's take a little example so i have a

77
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,560
way i want to get the maximum

78
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,319
of it very simple yeah in in python you

79
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,360
can just do this max

80
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,840
ai

81
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,040
how about i tell you to implement this

82
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,400
one way to

83
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,159
do one

84
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,000
return

85
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,599
yeah i know but

86
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
i don't want you to use this function

87
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,239
just implement it define max let's

88
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,080
define this max nums okay

89
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,480
so that letter will be very easy yeah

90
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,959
assuming this num is not empty

91
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,200
then we can do uh

92
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,400
like the answer equals

93
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,879
max

94
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,120
infinity negative infinity and then we

95
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,400
go through each number

96
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,920
yeah

97
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,360
in

98
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,840
num

99
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:47,680
and an answer equals

100
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,599
max okay so this is not

101
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,640
this uh so we are not using the max

102
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,519
function right so we can say if i bigger

103
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,680
than

104
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,159
answer

105
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,640
then answer equals i right and then

106
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:03,200
return i this is called the linear

107
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,560
linear we do this linear

108
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,840
linear time

109
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,360
right

110
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,040
very simple yeah we go through this

111
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,480
array first of all the answer is

112
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,720
negative

113
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,200
infinity we go through each number and i

114
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,359
will try to compare the number with the

115
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,440
answer and if it's bigger than an answer

116
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,600
we update it with the answer is the

117
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,840
current number right the time complexity

118
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,880
is o

119
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:29,680
if there are numbers in these nums oh

120
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,000
oh what's the space homelessly any space

121
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,720
no a one constant okay

122
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,960
constant space

123
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,960
okay so now look if we want to find

124
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,960
these numbers okay let's say

125
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,360
10 20

126
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,320
like one five

127
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,240
nine what's the maximum of this array

128
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,280
all right look what's the maximum of

129
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,759
this

130
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,360
twenty we can go through this yeah one

131
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,520
by one and try to compare with the

132
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,360
answer yeah that's the meaning and how

133
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,600
about we use the divided concept first

134
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,280
of all we divide this into half

135
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,960
or we can divide it into three parts

136
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,680
four parts depending but let's let's

137
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,520
just take one simple

138
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,120
divide

139
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,800
well that's a good question okay i'll

140
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,400
tell you later we first of all if we can

141
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,880
divide it into half okay so that

142
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,400
requires it needs to be at least two

143
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,960
elements right so we can divide it in

144
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,960
half we divide it in half

145
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,680
right so we because we saw this function

146
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:28,080
for example this one the maximum is nine

147
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,479
this one maximum is 20.

148
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,720
okay so now we compare this yeah how do

149
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:35,120
you get them

150
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,680
how do we get the it's nine or ten here

151
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,560
oh then we divide this into half right

152
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,560
yeah it might not be equally divided but

153
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,400
we can divide it and this is one number

154
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,840
that that's the thing you can't divide

155
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,240
one number into five

156
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:51,919
so we just written this number

157
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:54,080
look four five one divided into two

158
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:57,360
what's the biggest one five

159
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,639
okay and five and nine which is biggest

160
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,720
nine yeah

161
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,840
okay and nine this way here dividing

162
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,440
into two

163
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:07,600
this this part ten this far twenty

164
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,360
20 and 20 20

165
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,319
29 20.

166
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,919
okay

167
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,080
make sense

168
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,520
yeah okay so i'm going to implement this

169
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,440
and then you need to tell me what

170
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,360
advantage of using this approach using

171
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,919
this one look at this very simple one

172
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,160
right so i can just implement this why

173
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,440
should i care about using this divide

174
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,280
and conquer

175
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,639
just think about the advantage of using

176
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,880
this one okay

177
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,000
so first of all let's implement

178
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,520
sorry

179
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
much more quicker

180
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,440
quicker yeah it's related to cooking why

181
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,039
it's quicker

182
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,639
why it's quicker think about it okay

183
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,039
you're very close to the answer you're

184
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:46,160
very close defined let's say

185
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:49,599
let again this is max okay this is

186
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:52,479
numbers okay and now we need to have a

187
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:55,039
divide function inside divide

188
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,039
divide

189
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,319
divide and then

190
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,319
what divide

191
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,759
so divide um

192
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,360
maybe we can we don't need to be look

193
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,240
look if

194
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,160
lens

195
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,080
numbers

196
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,120
equal equal one if it's only one number

197
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,599
we just return it yeah return it

198
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,120
numbs zero

199
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,880
okay

200
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,720
now the meter power we want to separate

201
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,759
the meter power so meter power equals

202
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,520
one

203
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,039
length

204
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,120
nums

205
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:32,400
divided by two right

206
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,840
right and what's the left left max look

207
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,520
left max

208
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,759
equal then we called because we call

209
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,599
this one here max

210
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,400
nums

211
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,479
up to meet yeah up to mid

212
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,039
up to mid and what's the right max enter

213
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:49,199
me look so i separate this is the middle

214
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:51,680
part there are total number if there's

215
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,080
only one animal i'll return it right

216
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,319
we can't continue dividing it right

217
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,599
there's got to be somewhere we need to

218
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,919
terminate education meet is length yeah

219
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:04,479
the number of element divided by two

220
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,960
then max

221
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:09,120
up to mid right up to mid

222
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,960
right max

223
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,919
okay so if this is two then that two

224
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:17,039
divided by 2 is 1 right so meat is up to

225
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:19,759
1 so it's the first one and then y max 1

226
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,840
divided by 2

227
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,639
no sorry 1 divided by 2.

228
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:28,000
numbs and then a mixed meat

229
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:30,080
remember this yeah from mid to the end

230
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
up to the mid not equal right so look

231
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,839
left max

232
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,159
i divide it into two halves

233
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,159
this is the maximum part of the left

234
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:41,360
part left array

235
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:43,919
drive max is the max part

236
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,920
max value of the second half

237
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,440
and i just need to return the maximum

238
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,800
these two right

239
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,959
all right

240
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,880
so if

241
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,800
left max

242
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,640
bigger and right max would we determine

243
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,360
which one

244
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,360
right return

245
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,080
if left max bigger than right max return

246
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,360
and otherwise return

247
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,720
s or you know we don't need to write the

248
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,880
s return you have to explain half

249
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,040
good question we don't

250
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,760
like what i said we can split into three

251
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:23,040
four or five right but split into tough

252
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,080
is most easy way to implement

253
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,839
right

254
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:29,200
all right okay

255
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,200
so return right next yeah

256
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,800
make sense look if there's only one

257
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,480
element

258
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,240
yeah we can't separate into half we

259
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,480
determine it right it's the max of that

260
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,720
array right if it's if there's only if

261
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,160
at least it's one what's the max of this

262
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,680
one one is

263
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,360
an emitter

264
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,200
is the number of element divided by two

265
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,600
right that's the meter

266
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,760
left next we do cursory we divide we

267
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,760
divide this problem into two two halves

268
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,680
right the first row

269
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,000
we want to get the maximum left that

270
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,120
part and we're going to get the maximum

271
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,200
second half

272
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,880
right only closely we call this function

273
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,560
maximum

274
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,680
and then after these we get these two

275
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,040
numbers right

276
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,640
and now we need to compare which one is

277
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,040
bigger just return it

278
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,640
so like what i said look one two three

279
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,519
four

280
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,560
five six okay now look

281
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,000
right

282
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:23,920
into half and then look this into half

283
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,600
this into half

284
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,000
okay one two

285
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,240
into half okay now it's one number

286
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,640
one and two which one is bigger two

287
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,800
two and three which is bigger three

288
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,120
four and five okay now this is four and

289
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,360
five we can divide it into half right

290
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,880
four and five five is bigger

291
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,680
five and six

292
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,279
six is bigger okay now three and six

293
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:49,680
six is bigger you see

294
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:52,160
yeah so when we recursively divide this

295
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,880
right and the way you keep recursively

296
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:57,360
calling this this and here is only one

297
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,880
element and now because one element we

298
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,040
already know it's

299
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,880
the answer then

300
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:06,240
then what we

301
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,360
we back you know we start building this

302
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,079
recursion

303
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,800
from the bot to the up yeah then going

304
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,000
up

305
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,680
going up going up going up going up this

306
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,680
is like a trick

307
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,519
make sense

308
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,720
so okay so come come back to the

309
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,399
question

310
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,640
why do we have to use this one what's

311
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,320
the advantage of this one instead of you

312
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:29,279
know linear just going through this

313
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,040
element one by one to compare it

314
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,720
right

315
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,200
the linear one

316
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,920
we can use it on one computer but this

317
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,680
one if there are a million numbers

318
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,120
for one computer you need to go to a

319
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,519
million times

320
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,600
right but if i have two computer i can

321
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,959
divide the list into half million half

322
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,519
million

323
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,800
right and i can use these two computers

324
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,279
to do it

325
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,480
at the same time in parallel

326
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,959
am i right

327
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,720
or maybe a uh a minion computer let's

328
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:01,120
say a million computers you know just

329
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,519
one extreme cases

330
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:06,399
okay that makes sense

331
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:08,800
yeah if look let's let's don't think

332
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:11,200
about uh let's don't take

333
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,279
uh you know consider the communication

334
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,519
cost between these computers let's just

335
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,639
imagine you know these computers can

336
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:20,079
communicate

337
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:21,680
instantly without problems

338
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,639
100 numbers

339
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,079
for a single computer

340
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,560
you need to

341
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:31,279
go through these 100 numbers let's say i

342
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:34,000
have 10 computers

343
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,200
each computer take 10 numbers

344
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,200
right

345
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,839
am right

346
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,399
it makes sense so they can each computer

347
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,079
take 10 numbers 10 computers take 10

348
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,160
numbers so

349
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:49,600
each computer can doing this on the same

350
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:53,639
time in parallel in another paragraph

351
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,639
parallel what does it mean

352
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,959
it means two lines that go the same way

353
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:03,279
and then all right look at that what

354
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:03,279
does it mean so look why this is doing

355
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,480
okay so let's think about this example

356
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,839
okay

357
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,959
let's say eric you have a page of 100

358
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,120
pages

359
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:15,200
not 100 pages

360
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,200
and i don't care if you finish reading

361
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,120
it or you and write and finish it

362
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,200
together

363
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,160
so how how long does it take if if you

364
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,240
take you if you only you read the 100

365
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:29,279
pages it may be going to take what an

366
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,839
hour right supposedly it doesn't take a

367
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:34,560
long time to read okay okay i'm just

368
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:37,839
giving an example right ryan let's say

369
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:40,240
your personal reading the same speed and

370
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,079
how about if i say okay for the first 50

371
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,079
pages

372
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:46,560
you eric

373
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:48,880
you read it and then at the same time

374
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,279
ryan you can use read the second half

375
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,360
which is from 51 to 100.

376
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:56,399
so how long does it take for

377
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,320
for this page 100 pages

378
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:01,040
i don't get it sorry you don't get

379
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,040
anyone okay

380
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,440
so you have one book right a book of

381
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,959
maybe

382
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,399
okay

383
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:11,279
yeah

384
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:15,160
let's put this 100 chocolates yeah

385
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:15,160
easier 100 chocolates

386
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,920
100 chocolates

387
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,920
now

388
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,519
it takes you like an hour to eat one

389
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,839
chocolate

390
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:29,560
uh a minute to eat one chocolate okay a

391
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,560
minute you want chocolate

392
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,920
how long does it take for all the coins

393
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,839
all the chocolate coins to be eaten

394
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,240
100 minutes right

395
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,600
100 minutes

396
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,279
100 minutes

397
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,519
now ryan

398
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:49,040
you can hurt girga

399
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:51,279
right so how long does it take

400
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,360
15 minutes yeah that's what i say look

401
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,199
speed up

402
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,360
why why is it 15 minutes

403
00:14:55,199 --> 00:15:00,320
because you two can eat it at the same

404
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,800
time that's in parallel

405
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,160
but why can't you just like

406
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,880
eat

407
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,880
away how big of a chocolate

408
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,240
i'll make a chocolate okay very very big

409
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,600
maybe this big

410
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,360
okay

411
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,279
okay okay come on come on if it was

412
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,040
really small yeah yeah i know just

413
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:19,920
example

414
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,920
so so my question my so here's the thing

415
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,760
okay there are a hundred numbers

416
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,639
and then like 10 computers they can do

417
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,240
this in parallel right they can do this

418
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,560
in parallel so let's speed up could be

419
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,240
10 10 times faster all right

420
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,920
i'm right because they can do it at the

421
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,920
same time that's the advantage of using

422
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,839
the divide and conquer because we can

423
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:42,240
divide this problem into a few sub

424
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:43,680
problems and they are independent right

425
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,320
they are independent and can be

426
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,160
processed in parallel at the same time

427
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,320
and when we get the result from each

428
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,720
part of the sub problems then we can

429
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:55,360
merge it yeah we can merge it

430
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,600
right like the maximum uh getting the

431
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,199
maximum right getting the maximum then

432
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,560
we can do what

433
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,800
uh we

434
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:05,199
we can compare right the maximum of each

435
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,880
part right am right are you right

436
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:09,680
yeah are you all right

437
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,680
yeah so let's see

438
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,720
let's divide and conquer any other

439
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:17,040
examples like we have talked about what

440
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:20,639
much sauce yeah munchie sauce

441
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,639
do you still remember the magic sauce

442
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,880
yeah i'm going to quickly write it okay

443
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,880
come on divide much easier

444
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,920
can you stop

445
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,079
stoplight please

446
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,800
numbs okay now look

447
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:39,440
if there's only one number

448
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:43,199
if there's only one number

449
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,199
then we return it right return this

450
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,560
return it right because what number one

451
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,639
number is already sorted right what

452
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,079
number is saudi now the meter power the

453
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,560
middle part is what

454
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:56,160
the middle part is the

455
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,240
nums

456
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,600
divided by two okay and then what's the

457
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,560
left one what's the

458
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,759
right

459
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,360
look

460
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,760
left

461
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,880
equals let's say we want to merge sort

462
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,360
the

463
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,919
the last part that's part numbers area

464
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,919
look at me

465
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,439
nouns up to me right

466
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:20,400
and can you tell me what to write left

467
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,400
right equals what

468
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,039
start from me to the end right now

469
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,440
okay

470
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:36,799
yeah i know what's next if i have left

471
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:40,400
and right what's next

472
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,400
if i have left and right what's next

473
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:46,080
can you not touch my computer for the

474
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,600
last time okay

475
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,919
all right

476
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,760
i have left part i have right what what

477
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,840
should i do look one two three how do

478
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,039
you how do you make how do we merge one

479
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,400
two three and

480
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,320
four five six

481
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,200
to make it

482
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:03,360
remember we merged to saute this yeah we

483
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,520
need to merge two saute this remember we

484
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,919
talked about this much saute this then

485
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,480
we just merge this is merged left and

486
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,480
right okay

487
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:17,039
that's the margin so remember look we

488
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,080
have salty this yet one two five one two

489
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,200
four and

490
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,760
three

491
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,160
four five how do we merge this look we

492
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:26,400
have two pointers we have one and three

493
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:29,280
yeah keep moving one and three which one

494
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:32,240
is smaller one one and then move it two

495
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:35,360
and three which is smaller two

496
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:37,600
two then i move it four and three

497
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,039
four three yeah and three i move this

498
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,000
yeah four and four okay it doesn't

499
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:43,120
matter

500
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,760
and i move this yeah five yeah

501
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,910
okay make sense

502
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,240
make sense

503
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:51,520
[Music]

504
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,520
okay this is much soft and then

505
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,600
the hanoi tower right we talked about

506
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,559
that and what else what else can we do

507
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,679
this

508
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:59,679
what else can we do this

509
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,840
we can okay i'm going to talk about

510
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:08,559
another quick problem okay just very

511
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:10,799
quick very quick alola another ruler

512
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,799
okay

513
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,200
and then look we have uh

514
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:30,080
in a meter in the middle and then do

515
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,080
this to this yeah yeah you want to do

516
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,960
this

517
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,880
yeah something like that

518
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,720
oh yeah

519
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,799
yeah lula so you have these different

520
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,960
measurements okay so we can have a

521
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,799
function like define

522
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,080
lula

523
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:49,600
left

524
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:51,440
you need left right

525
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,640
and then height height is least high

526
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,799
yeah

527
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,799
hi

528
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,799
okay so first of all meet the meat okay

529
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:03,919
so look it has to be r minus air has to

530
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:06,320
be the power of uh you know so basically

531
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:08,480
let's make this simple so so basically

532
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,880
you want to have a ruler which come

533
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,039
which can be separated recursively right

534
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,760
so in order for this to be

535
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:17,840
uh be possible to lose we we need to

536
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:21,120
make sure 2 to the power h equals r

537
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:23,120
minus l okay so this is the requirement

538
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,480
can i replace it

539
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,840
okay

540
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,840
okay

541
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:30,960
so first of all the meter one the meter

542
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:33,120
one equals air plus r

543
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,039
divided by two right

544
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,280
every yn

545
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:40,159
meter equals a plus one divided by two

546
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:43,600
we can do this just divided by two okay

547
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:46,480
all we can do is l plus ah 51 okay let's

548
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,480
draw the same okay

549
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:50,880
and now look if height is bigger than

550
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,039
zero

551
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,320
if the height is bigger than zero then

552
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:59,120
we do what what we can do we need to

553
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:01,600
do lula make the

554
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:04,799
for the first half which is which which

555
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:07,760
is what air and the meter

556
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:10,000
but the height will be five minus one

557
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,000
right

558
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:15,120
will be height minus one okay yeah what

559
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:17,840
did i say what did i say high minus one

560
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,840
what does this mean

561
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,960
you're not listening okay should i

562
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,080
repeat again

563
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,799
yeah

564
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:27,120
i want to i want to make um

565
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:28,720
to make the markers of the rulers right

566
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,200
so i want to get the middle one this one

567
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:34,559
this side get the middle one yeah

568
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,240
and then look i want recursively

569
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,559
recursively i want to

570
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,720
mark the left left side yeah this left

571
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:43,600
side which is this one and then i want

572
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,400
to mark now i want to mark at

573
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,679
here

574
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,400
here

575
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:50,799
which is meter and this is h and then i

576
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,600
want to mark what what's missing

577
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:53,600
what's this part

578
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:59,280
so what's the parameter what's the first

579
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:02,799
parameter i want to get

580
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:06,240
air to meet and now this is what

581
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:06,240
you really are busy right

582
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,760
what's the speed

583
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,919
it's

584
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:14,880
air to meet the air to meet and then

585
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:17,520
what's this b to r right

586
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:20,400
mid to r good r

587
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,559
right okay and then h minus one right

588
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,159
look this is quite similar to hanoi

589
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:27,200
tower right first of all there are three

590
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:29,600
steps we want to we want to complete the

591
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,000
marking of the ruler so what's the step

592
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,120
first of all we want to mark the center

593
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,720
right

594
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:39,280
and then the second step mark the left

595
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,600
the third step mark on the right

596
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:43,919
divide and conquer easy

597
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:46,320
and once we keep marking and when the

598
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:48,559
height is bigger than zero right if high

599
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,240
is you know if high is always is smaller

600
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:52,080
than zero height

601
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,600
height look this is the height

602
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,520
how long you want to mark it right

603
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,200
because the lower you know if you keep

604
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,360
doing that you'll be smaller right

605
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,200
always it will be shorter shorter

606
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,559
shorter the length yeah this is

607
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,640
controlled by the height the surf

608
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:08,080
parameter makes sense this would just be

609
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,840
a dot yeah when it's 0 so then that's

610
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,880
the time we stopped marking okay so

611
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,480
let's say

612
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,400
divide and conquer okay that's the

613
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,559
concept that's the concept that's a very

614
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,080
important concept of the computer

615
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,679
programming we use the divide and

616
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,840
conquer to solve

617
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,400
the a big problem

618
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:26,320
by dividing it into a smaller problem

619
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,240
and this small problem can be

620
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,840
independently

621
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,880
solved so it means that we can

622
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,880
parallelize you know

623
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,000
what's the advantage of

624
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,679
of the parallelization

625
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,039
parallelizing what why do we need to

626
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,799
parallelize it

627
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:46,159
what's the advantage what advantage we

628
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:46,159
can get from parallelizing it

629
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,840
to make it what

630
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:56,400
i was talking about the coins example so

631
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,480
what's the advantage of making it

632
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,480
parallel

633
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,400
it'll be quicker quicker yeah it'll be

634
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,240
quicker yes the polarization because

635
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,200
this problem can be done in parallel

636
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,679
okay

637
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,760
okay that's it for today good job

638
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:13,080
bye bye

639
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,080
bye bye
