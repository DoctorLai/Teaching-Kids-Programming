1
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,759
let's say we talk about some next

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:15,040
problem yeah knapsack knapsack

3
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,960
that's actually like a bag okay okay

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,080
okay a bag

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,359
so bad

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,400
so we have a few items yeah items

7
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,960
a few

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,800
items like uh and each one has weight

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,880
right the weight

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,760
wait let's say we have three items one

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,600
kilo two kilo three kilo

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,760
okay and then for each item we have

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,920
values right for example the first one

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,520
has one pound

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,120
one dollar us dollar okay five us dollar

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,320
two us dollar

17
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,920
and this next set yeah can hold all at

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,480
most

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,680
and most what capacity five kilo okay

20
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,840
five kilo

21
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,280
so for each item obviously we only have

22
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,199
one you can pick it or not pick it so

23
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,440
what's the total

24
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:04,720
what's the maximum what's the maximum

25
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,920
value we can pack these item

26
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,280
into

27
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,159
the knife set the bag

28
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,119
okay

29
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:15,040
right so which which

30
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,759
these three items which one you want to

31
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,119
pick let's so to maximize the value the

32
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,720
value in the back

33
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,080
the last one

34
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,200
this one

35
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,159
and

36
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,479
look we have capacity five so we if we

37
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,640
pick this we have two more

38
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,840
remaining two so which which one we

39
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,920
should pick

40
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,439
the middle one yeah so look two plus

41
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,840
three

42
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,280
is smaller or equal five and the value

43
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,200
we get is

44
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,520
five plus three equals eight so this is

45
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,840
the maximum value we can get okay so

46
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,680
let's call the zero one next step

47
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,920
problem

48
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,560
generally so let's formulize these a

49
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,960
little bit okay so look

50
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,960
each one we can pick or not pick right

51
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,719
which one we can pick or nothing let's

52
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,640
let's put it as uh

53
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:04,399
pick p okay p

54
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:07,119
equals uh zero value yeah zero zero zero

55
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,759
or one value okay so if we pick it we

56
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,440
use the one if we don't pick it

57
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:14,480
it's yellow okay

58
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:17,360
all right so so we want to pick the item

59
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,720
we want to maximize we want to maximize

60
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,200
maximize

61
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,879
maximize maximize what

62
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,239
p

63
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,280
p i

64
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,440
times

65
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:32,080
p i i okay i index yeah p i times the v

66
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,120
i we want to we want to maximize this

67
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,920
yeah so

68
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,680
that's the sum of it so maximize this is

69
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:43,280
the sum okay okay when this is sum i

70
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:46,400
from 0 to n minus 1 n is the number of

71
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,959
elements in number of items yeah number

72
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,760
of items

73
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,480
okay

74
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,440
sum can you read this sum

75
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,959
i from zero to n minus one p i times v i

76
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,400
when it's zero

77
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,200
what does it mean we don't pick it one

78
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,599
is one we pick it right but this is the

79
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,000
maximum this is our target we want to

80
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,560
maximize this but we want to suggest to

81
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,440
what it suggests to what we don't want

82
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,599
the total weight to except the capacity

83
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,599
right so the total weight is what i

84
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,120
equal 0

85
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,040
n minus 1

86
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,959
wait yeah wait

87
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,959
wait it will be wi

88
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:26,159
times pi

89
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,040
is less or equal than c okay

90
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,840
you see

91
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,599
less than equals c w i is the weight

92
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,480
times ti look

93
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:36,159
if it's zero it doesn't use up the space

94
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,440
if it's one

95
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,720
if it's one

96
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:44,159
you use such space right yeah okay so

97
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:46,720
and then also we need to say p i

98
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,120
is belongs to

99
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,000
the yellow and one okay

100
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,640
yeah

101
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,239
this this makes it like zero one knocks

102
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,360
up okay

103
00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:00,080
can we can we choose the most valuable

104
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,439
one if we go for this strategy can we

105
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,439
choose the most valuable one

106
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,439
can we choose look what's your strategy

107
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,439
here what

108
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,799
you pick the

109
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:16,720
why you pick the last one at the

110
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:19,359
beginning not the middle one

111
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,359
it's because

112
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,360
because these are three yeah you just

113
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,720
run them and pick one right okay so you

114
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,560
might know what the right why is that

115
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,720
because look if this is the most

116
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,919
variable how about it's very very happy

117
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,080
heavy yeah

118
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,320
you can't pick it you can always

119
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,240
you can obviously put this 100 into the

120
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,199
c equals five right so this doesn't work

121
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,199
that's heavy yeah that's heavy items one

122
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,160
how about how about there's another

123
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:51,280
strategy if we consider v divided by w

124
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:54,479
the ratio yeah but you need the the most

125
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,639
valuable items in the uni in a single

126
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,800
unit weight for example that would be

127
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,520
2.5 that would be one that would be one

128
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,160
and how about let's put it 1.1 here

129
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,800
right so let's please yeah we pick this

130
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,960
2.5 but the next one we pick 1.1 which

131
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,400
is not clearly not the optimum right

132
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,199
yeah because this

133
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,800
misleads us to pick these but obviously

134
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,680
we need to pick this one

135
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,199
right

136
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,880
yeah

137
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,479
make sense

138
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,840
yeah

139
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:25,360
okay so

140
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,600
so for each item we can pick or not pick

141
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,600
so how many items are an item for each

142
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,360
one i can pick or not pick so how many

143
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,840
choices do we have

144
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,840
the first one we have and two choice the

145
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,759
second one we haven't two choice the

146
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,600
third one we have one another to try so

147
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,120
what's the time complexity if we prove

148
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,280
something yes

149
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,560
that would be equivalent of finding the

150
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,320
subsequence right remember the

151
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,960
subsequence

152
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,960
that's dependent

153
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,039
not continue yeah for each one we can

154
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,120
pick or not pick each one the first one

155
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,759
has two choice the second one has two

156
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,160
choice the third one has two choice the

157
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:03,039
the we have n items so they are in

158
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:06,319
choice right and choice here and choice

159
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,600
the tangent next is two to the power of

160
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,520
n right

161
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,680
this is the equivalent of finding the

162
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,520
subsequent the number of subsequent yeah

163
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,280
yeah

164
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,680
so yeah so the time convention will be

165
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:21,039
this one pick in the number and

166
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,720
obviously we need to times n to find out

167
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,960
the um

168
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:28,000
to sum up yeah to sum the values up

169
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,720
right so this is not very feasible very

170
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,639
not not it's practically very slow okay

171
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,120
but as we said for each one we can pick

172
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,960
or not pick and if we can

173
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,800
write it right

174
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,120
if we can use the computer to remember

175
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,960
it remember yeah if we give it a set

176
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,180
okay we ask computers to remember what

177
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,400
kind of accurate come to your mind

178
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:50,000
[Music]

179
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,080
yeah that'll be programming okay and

180
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,800
i'll use the top down today and tomorrow

181
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,759
we'll talk about the butter up okay

182
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:02,800
okay so for each one

183
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:05,120
yeah so look define let's define cut

184
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,759
defined let's say

185
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,360
first search i know for two parameters

186
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,680
the first parameter i the second

187
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,840
pendulum is c y

188
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,280
and c okay good question that's a good

189
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,599
question what does it mean it means that

190
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,440
we are remember that the numbers we're

191
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,680
picking yeah yeah we're picking the

192
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,120
numbers remember yeah it's quite similar

193
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,000
to that problem

194
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:29,280
we are picking the ice num ice item okay

195
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,240
we are picking the ice item okay

196
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,120
the

197
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,599
the the first item is zero yeah

198
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,520
we are kicking with ice item and then we

199
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,520
have capacity c

200
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:44,479
in the next

201
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:46,960
okay look if i equal equal length the

202
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,720
the weight or i value yeah doesn't

203
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,240
matter

204
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,039
if we have

205
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:56,479
we are running out of items

206
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:59,479
so we return the value which will be

207
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,479
what

208
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:03,890
[Music]

209
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,879
yeah it's the same you can put a value

210
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,360
yeah it's the same it's the length right

211
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,440
the length of the values and uh

212
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,199
weights are the same yeah different the

213
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,400
same thing yeah

214
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,360
represent the number of items right now

215
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,199
now for

216
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,240
now i i can get the answer at the

217
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:33,279
beginning of this year okay now like if

218
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,839
if this capacity we have capacity equal

219
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:38,839
bigger than equal the weight

220
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:42,320
current item is weight high

221
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:45,519
right so look we have capacity c and the

222
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,120
current item has weight this weight all

223
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,920
right

224
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,399
if

225
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,519
we have enough capacity to pick this

226
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,440
item

227
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,480
right so we can pick it we can try to

228
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,720
pick it

229
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,640
right you can just take it answer equals

230
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,480
max answer

231
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,040
and if we pick it

232
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,320
pick it dfs we need to pick the next

233
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,399
item

234
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,040
and what happened to the capacity if we

235
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:11,360
pick it what's the capacity left

236
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,360
minus weighs i yeah we just need to

237
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,080
minus here

238
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,640
i yeah this one

239
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:22,160
and then we we have picked this so we

240
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:24,720
have we we gain the value right plus

241
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,240
values what i

242
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,959
make sense

243
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,040
right and obviously we cannot we we can

244
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,000
choose not to pick this item right so i

245
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:36,080
can say

246
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:39,760
answer equals max answer

247
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:42,320
we're not picking it dfs but we try to

248
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,320
move to the next item yeah and then we

249
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,519
still have capacity c if we don't pick

250
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,040
it right

251
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:51,560
yeah

252
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,560
return answer make sense

253
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,120
what's missing here

254
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,200
if we're not putting any sketch

255
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,600
right

256
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,839
exponential it's like i said o two to

257
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,519
the power of n right yeah to the power

258
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,200
to the power because each one we can

259
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,240
pick or not pick each one will pick

260
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,040
nothing

261
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,600
i and c right so it's actually

262
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,760
what i and c so

263
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,079
i will be the item okay if we list the

264
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,079
values here okay this is i

265
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,000
i will be the number of items yeah so

266
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,040
you'll be 0 1

267
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,079
2

268
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,560
here

269
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:32,959
and minus 1 right this is item and then

270
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,079
c is the capacity

271
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,959
0

272
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,040
1

273
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:40,160
2

274
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:42,079
yeah yeah we we saw this

275
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,959
table before yeah if we want to pick

276
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,000
these

277
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:48,320
and minus one item and then capacity c

278
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,160
somehow here yeah c somehow here i want

279
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,079
to compute this value

280
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,480
but the computer needs to go through

281
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,959
these okay then you look for the

282
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,600
for what for the values here somewhere

283
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:01,279
and then these would be again we need to

284
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,680
calculate in order to calculate this

285
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,959
value i need to calculate a few more

286
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,800
values right

287
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,320
yeah but each time

288
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,279
each time

289
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,600
i calculate this value i make it i may

290
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:16,399
have to calculate some

291
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,880
same pixel same number again and again

292
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:21,839
right yeah but if i put a cache what's

293
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:25,360
the what's the maximum number of values

294
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,360
i need to compute in this table

295
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,399
and uh times n where down c times n yeah

296
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,959
yeah if i'm gonna catch it right because

297
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:38,000
everything i only calculate once if i

298
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:40,320
calculate it and what what what do we do

299
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,480
we store the numbers in the cash

300
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,040
right so the next time you just look it

301
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,920
up the value and you don't need to

302
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:50,160
to do it again and again right okay

303
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,040
yeah look look at this one

304
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,399
now

305
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:56,399
if if the current capacity is bigger

306
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,320
than the weight the weight now we can

307
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,680
pick it we can try to pick it when we

308
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,079
try to pick it

309
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:05,360
the weight needs to substrate these but

310
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,880
the values need to pass it right yeah

311
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,839
right

312
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,600
and

313
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,639
look eyes

314
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,760
0 to n and we can obviously we can start

315
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:17,519
from i backwards yeah from n minus 1 to

316
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,720
0 this is the same thing

317
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:23,360
this implementation is from 0 to n minus

318
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,760
1 because look this is plus 1 right if

319
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,920
we start from n minus one to zero this

320
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,440
this will be minus one minus one and

321
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,320
then these will be

322
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,200
smaller than zero right okay

323
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,040
yeah

324
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,519
yeah smaller than zero okay let's write

325
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,160
this book if this is smaller than zero

326
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,480
right smaller than zero and this needs

327
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,560
to minus one yeah

328
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,600
and then we in order to get this value

329
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:50,399
we just return dfs

330
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,720
uh n minus one which is length of weight

331
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,720
or length of values n minus 1 and at the

332
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,519
beginning we have capacity c

333
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,079
all right

334
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:00,000
so you'll be start at this value yeah in

335
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,360
order to calculate this value what

336
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,880
happened

337
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:07,440
we might have to calculate

338
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,839
this value uh here if we don't pick

339
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,839
anything or if we pick that item could

340
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,360
be somewhere here right somewhere here

341
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,120
right somewhere here

342
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,880
right and again in order to calculate

343
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,839
this value we need to take a release

344
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,480
value

345
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,959
or somewhere here right okay

346
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,959
and so these this looking up this is

347
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,480
top-down top-down dynamic programming if

348
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,800
we put a cache

349
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,279
yeah make sense

350
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,920
anybody any questions

351
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:36,240
no questions okay are you sure okay can

352
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,800
you explain to me what's this

353
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,959
what's this

354
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,920
what's this this is the most important

355
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:45,680
thing to take away from the cash

356
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,959
can can somebody explain to me about

357
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,959
this why are we

358
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,150
is um greater than the weight which is

359
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,720
good because

360
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:59,839
[Music]

361
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:02,000
if this is current remaining capacity of

362
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,920
the back right the left side it's bigger

363
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,920
than this item well wait we can try to

364
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,240
book it yeah yeah you can burn level one

365
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,440
you can put it and then once we put it

366
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,959
what will happen

367
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,320
we need to substrate away from the

368
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:16,639
capacity yeah do the dms but again we

369
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,120
get a value right and then you can get

370
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,240
another one yeah and for and we can get

371
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,720
around

372
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,639
this is just two choice yeah this is

373
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,120
this choice is that

374
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:29,279
if we can put a put a value

375
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,480
and try we try putting it

376
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,480
right

377
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,560
because in

378
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,350
basically for each item we only have two

379
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,440
choice we pick it or not pick it right

380
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:38,480
[Music]

381
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,760
right

382
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,519
we pick it

383
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:45,360
this one is we don't kick it if we don't

384
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:48,240
pick it we try the the next item

385
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:51,839
with why this is c if we don't pick it

386
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,440
this is very obvious what does it say

387
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,639
because the

388
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,720
capacity the capacity capacity why is

389
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:01,600
this see if we don't pick it why is it

390
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,959
seriously because because you don't did

391
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,800
nothing change

392
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,800
where does nothing change yeah if we

393
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,199
don't pick it nothing change we try next

394
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,760
item right yeah if we pick it we can

395
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,440
pick it we try next item but the weight

396
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,600
needs to be subtracted and the value

397
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,279
needs to be yeah that's the maximum

398
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,480
weather i know we get the maximum yeah

399
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,680
yeah okay the time can taxi l times c

400
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,079
times n yeah

401
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:27,120
as we said right if we put a cash it's

402
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:29,120
all c times n okay

403
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,399
and if we don't take it it's o to the

404
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,639
power of n

405
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,639
you have l to the power of n actually

406
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,920
because each one will pick up and times

407
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,399
times the

408
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:42,000
n right times n okay

409
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:44,240
the number of items yeah we need to put

410
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,160
two the number of items and this one we

411
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,160
can pick on the pick so actually this is

412
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,320
the same as

413
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:53,440
iterating the

414
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:56,079
array and try each subsequent right for

415
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,680
each subsequence we need to

416
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:00,320
compute its

417
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:02,480
its weight right its values right yeah

418
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:05,360
it's where it is

419
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,800
yeah okay that's it for today good job

420
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,800
bye-bye

421
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,800
bye-bye
