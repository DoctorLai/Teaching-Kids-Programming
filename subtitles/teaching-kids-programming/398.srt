1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,790
[Music]

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:10,960
okay what do you call this a x squared

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:14,480
plus b x plus c equals zero well equated

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:17,279
a not equal to zero and b a b c are

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,160
unknown a constant yeah and x is the

6
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:22,480
only i know it's right yeah conservative

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,960
equation yeah

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,960
if a is zero it's not created it's a

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,840
line if a is zero

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,760
b thing is gone so b x plus c equals

11
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,840
zero let's let's align

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,440
a line if you draw it as a function it's

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,480
a line yeah yeah

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:41,360
if we place what what do we call it

15
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:45,120
what do we call it if we if we if we

16
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,480
plot the quadratic equation on a

17
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,559
x y

18
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,120
axis every important thing

19
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:54,000
yeah it would be something like that

20
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,840
it would be you know like that

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,719
or better

22
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:02,719
okay

23
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:04,879
so when a is facing up uh when a is uh

24
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,799
positive the whole thing is facing up

25
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,040
yeah it could be something like that

26
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,360
when a is negative

27
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:15,119
you'll be facing down right

28
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,640
well if if this graph intersects with

29
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,320
the x-axis

30
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,200
yeah we call it look if it's something

31
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:25,840
like area so we have two intersection

32
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:27,920
points that's the root let's then lose

33
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,280
the root of the equation so you have two

34
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:34,079
equations which is x1 equals 2 times a

35
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:38,000
minus b plus

36
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:39,439
b squared minus 4ac and the other one x2

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,560
equals

38
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:45,439
2 times a minus b minus

39
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,360
b squared minus 4ac okay so we we have

40
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,560
this we have uh

41
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,479
through these

42
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,640
in the previous video so i'm not going

43
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:56,320
to go into details this time

44
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:59,360
so look so in what cases we have this

45
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:03,200
line this particular line equation has

46
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,200
the intersection with x-axis

47
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,399
we look into this term yeah

48
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,440
yeah because the

49
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,520
square root of something yeah is

50
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,520
something that x needs to be bigger or

51
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,440
equal than zero right if it's negative

52
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,440
it doesn't have a real root what i'm

53
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,640
saying here is real root okay

54
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,400
real root

55
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,200
so this function

56
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,319
has imaginary root which is the other

57
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:31,599
topic okay so if x is bigger or equal

58
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,680
than zero here so b squared minus four

59
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:36,560
times ac needs to bigger or equal than

60
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,000
zero okay so one question if it's b b

61
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,319
square equals

62
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,360
minus four ac is equal to zero what

63
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,760
happened

64
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,120
if it's just one if if this term is zero

65
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,360
what happened

66
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,840
what happened what happened with the x1

67
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,160
x2

68
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,720
yeah we

69
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:56,000
uh if this is the same what happened

70
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,000
with x1 and x2

71
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,959
you'll be the same we're wrong so

72
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,400
you'll be less than

73
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,159
when we look at the graph in x y axis

74
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,159
what happens what happens when it's the

75
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,239
same

76
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,519
it will

77
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,840
it will be what

78
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,560
if these two points become one single

79
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,560
point what happened

80
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,280
what's this what what happened what

81
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,599
yeah yeah we're touching yeah this this

82
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,440
this thing will touch okay the equation

83
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,760
will touch wow

84
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,760
okay

85
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:37,599
okay okay and the symmetric axis

86
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:40,319
for the symmetric axis is what look look

87
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:44,239
look at this this this thing yeah

88
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:46,799
everybody look this thing if x1 here x2

89
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:50,159
here right

90
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,879
okay actually this is x2 this is x1

91
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:57,120
so look this is in the meter so

92
00:03:52,879 --> 00:04:00,080
this meter thing is x equals minus

93
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,239
2 times a b over 2 times a look this is

94
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,799
the axis symmetric axis yeah because

95
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,239
look x1 x2

96
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,480
is

97
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,959
has the same distance close to this

98
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,959
x-axis yeah symmetric okay

99
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,799
this is symmetric axis

100
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,720
okay this is a conjecture yeah we talked

101
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,320
about this a long time ago okay this is

102
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,560
the mathematics

103
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,160
so now today we're going to talk about

104
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,080
this continuous

105
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,280
continual fraction

106
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:31,680
so what's what's this 1 plus 1 over one

107
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:34,880
plus one over one plus one over one plus

108
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,800
i'm going yeah what's the value of this

109
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,240
we don't know right it's hard it's hard

110
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,960
to look but look

111
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,560
if i said this whole thing to x

112
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,759
yeah

113
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,560
x equals 1 plus this right

114
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,360
yeah

115
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,360
yeah

116
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,280
okay so this is infinity it repeats

117
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,320
itself the pattern repeats itself okay

118
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:57,919
so look what's this bit

119
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,520
uh was this uh one plus

120
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,479
what's this big

121
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,960
one plus what's this

122
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,960
x

123
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,280
uh actually no no actually it's this bit

124
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,160
yeah

125
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,160
these bits

126
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:18,080
one okay x equals one plus this bit okay

127
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,639
this bit

128
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,440
yes because i set the whole thing to to

129
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,600
x

130
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,800
so this this thing

131
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,080
listen

132
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,759
is it

133
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,720
the same as x

134
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,800
yeah

135
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,320
okay so if i said this to x though x

136
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,680
equals 1 plus 1 over x

137
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,919
right

138
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,160
x is not equal to zero right obviously

139
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,400
right this thing is never going to be

140
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,120
zero if i times x

141
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,400
so that will be x square equals x plus

142
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,160
one

143
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,160
make sense

144
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,840
what's this function look

145
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,240
what's this function

146
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,199
x squared minus if i move the right

147
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,560
terms

148
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,080
terms from the right hand side to the

149
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,560
left-hand side

150
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,960
minus one equals zero okay

151
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,560
what's this

152
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,880
what's this

153
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,759
quadratic equation

154
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:13,039
quadratic equation a equals one

155
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:15,759
b equals minus one c equals minus one

156
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:20,800
okay so it has two roots right yes two

157
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:22,560
roots so x one equals two times a

158
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,080
minus b

159
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,960
plus

160
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:30,160
b squared minus 4ac

161
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:33,440
is b squared minus 4ac will be plus 4

162
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,639
okay the other the yellow root is the

163
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,000
same

164
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,520
but changing the sign okay 1 plus 4

165
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,160
right

166
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,280
1 minus square root of 5

167
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,120
is

168
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,919
negative right

169
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,000
square root of 5 is more than 1 am right

170
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:52,000
yeah because square root of four is two

171
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,120
right square root of five is two point

172
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,479
something

173
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,360
so look the x2 is smaller than zero

174
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,120
right

175
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,039
so is is this

176
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,840
a positive of negative number if you

177
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,840
look at this one

178
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,759
looks like looks like positive or

179
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,199
negative come on guess

180
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,599
do you see a negative sign here

181
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,520
somewhere no okay so is this positive

182
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,759
negative

183
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,080
yeah it's obviously possibility one plus

184
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,680
one plus look even this thing is so

185
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,639
small

186
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,160
yeah

187
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,880
this whole thing is bigger than zero

188
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,720
right

189
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,160
this whole thing is bigger than zero so

190
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,000
this whole thing is bigger than zero

191
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,240
plus one is also bigger than zero so

192
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,160
this is smaller than zero so means that

193
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,440
we don't use this so the value is this

194
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,680
one so which is two times one plus

195
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,800
square root of five

196
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,080
okay

197
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,520
yeah

198
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,199
what's this

199
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,639
what's the square root of five what's

200
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,639
the number of square root of five

201
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,879
what's the what's the value of square

202
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,879
root of five come on

203
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,319
so i i i think there's a minus sign here

204
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:05,039
okay uh

205
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,479
no it's not a minus sign okay two point

206
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,400
something

207
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,919
two point something yeah

208
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,280
okay what's the square root of two point

209
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:15,599
something i think it's something

210
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,599
let me

211
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,879
2.236 okay

212
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,479
so

213
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:24,160
plus one

214
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,160
and then divided by two

215
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:31,160
okay it's 1.618 okay so this value is

216
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,160
1.618

217
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,479
something what's this

218
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:40,599
golden ratio exactly what's golden ratio

219
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,599
remember

220
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:45,600
this whole thing

221
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:47,600
this whole thing is

222
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,360
one okay uh let's say this whole thing

223
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,880
is the

224
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:55,360
a a plus b the longer the longer this is

225
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,480
a okay and this is the shorter one which

226
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,519
is b

227
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,519
so

228
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:03,360
a plus b

229
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:05,279
divided by a is equals to a divided by b

230
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,560
okay i think so yeah

231
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,760
so if we

232
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:13,920
if a is one for example

233
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,920
if if b is one okay if b is one

234
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,959
okay so this a square equals a squared

235
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,880
equals a plus one a squared minus a

236
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:25,760
minus one equals zero

237
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,120
okay look this is the same thing here

238
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,959
okay

239
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,959
yeah 1.618 okay

240
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,480
so

241
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,920
uh

242
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,560
so if i change this one to two whatever

243
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:43,680
so let's say okay it's the same yeah so

244
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:47,519
instead of one i change it to two

245
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:51,279
so x equals two plus two over x right if

246
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,480
i times multiply x at the same time so x

247
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:56,240
squared

248
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:59,200
equals two x plus two

249
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,279
x squared minus two x minus two equals

250
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,839
zero so what's x

251
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:07,440
two times

252
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:07,440
a a is one yeah

253
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,800
b

254
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,160
my two times a

255
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:16,240
minus b okay two times a minus b

256
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,519
minus b is two

257
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,839
plus

258
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,200
minus b squared

259
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,640
4

260
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,839
plus 4 times ac which is

261
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,560
minus

262
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:32,079
b squared minus 4ac

263
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:36,320
okay what you're doing so this is a okay

264
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:36,320
so that would be 1 plus minus

265
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,800
12

266
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,360
okay square root of 12

267
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:46,399
is square root of 4 times 3

268
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:50,399
is 2 times square root of three okay so

269
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,399
if i divide it by two again that will be

270
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,760
square root of three okay so this one

271
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,959
this number

272
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:59,920
square root of three is one point seven

273
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,720
three two something yeah minus one yeah

274
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,760
uh

275
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,240
yeah

276
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,320
uh we use the plus yeah because it's

277
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,360
more than one if we minus it'll be

278
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,440
negative

279
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,120
so plus it will be two point three three

280
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,440
three uh

281
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,279
seven three two okay uh let me just

282
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,360
start the chair

283
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:19,600
let me just have a chat queen square

284
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:23,519
root of three

285
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,519
okay one point seven three two okay

286
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,519
so if i want you if we wanted you

287
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,600
to

288
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,680
calculate this using the python curve

289
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,399
yeah how do we do it

290
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,399
how do we do it

291
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,120
we can

292
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,079
let's say x equals one over one plus one

293
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,360
plus

294
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,519
okay

295
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:57,360
anything okay yeah

296
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,480
so define let's call it f

297
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,680
okay

298
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,279
so

299
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,760
n let's say

300
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:06,800
we call uh we want to iterate this n

301
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:10,320
time sometimes so look if

302
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,440
if n equal 0 then we just return we can

303
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,040
determine what

304
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,079
we can just return

305
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,680
if we're not iterating we can return

306
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:21,120
we can get rid of these that would be

307
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,320
0.5 right yeah one over one plus one

308
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,720
okay

309
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,680
okay oh we can keep this turn so one

310
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,519
over

311
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,600
one plus one zero point five yeah it's

312
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:33,360
the same

313
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:35,680
otherwise we return what we turn

314
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:39,440
return what

315
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:41,839
one looks

316
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,000
look 1

317
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:46,560
divided by

318
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,399
1 plus

319
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,160
1 plus 1 come on how do we do this

320
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:53,760
iteratively

321
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,639
how do we put this iterated one plus

322
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,160
f

323
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,160
m minus one right

324
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,279
come on you see this i want to kick you

325
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:08,320
at least basically

326
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,320
i want to calculate this

327
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:14,560
so n is the number of times we iterate

328
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:16,320
okay if n is zero then we just return

329
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,760
this bit yeah

330
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,040
this bit is 0.5 right 1 over 1 plus one

331
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,720
otherwise

332
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:28,160
i would i it's equals to look one

333
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,600
one point zero divided by one plus

334
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,920
little thing

335
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,720
okay so this whole thing

336
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:37,440
this whole thing

337
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,680
yeah one part this whole thing is f n

338
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,279
minus one right yeah

339
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,279
okay

340
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,920
do you get it

341
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,920
do you get it

342
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,480
look this function f9 only depends on fn

343
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:56,160
minus one yeah fn minus one depends on

344
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,199
fn minus two so i i could i could put a

345
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,240
cache

346
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,519
here

347
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,120
but it doesn't

348
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,440
i mean doesn't really matter right

349
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,760
because in order to calculate n you need

350
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,120
to f n minus one and f and minus one is

351
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,240
called

352
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:13,600
each fm value is only called only used

353
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,959
once we're not using it

354
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,040
okay

355
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:19,920
so

356
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:22,240
look if we we want to we can we can pass

357
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,160
the parameters one here look this is one

358
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,240
right all right

359
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,680
so instead i could i could put another

360
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,720
parameter a

361
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,360
okay

362
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,440
and then this one i change it to a

363
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,000
here i change it to a

364
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,440
here i need to pass the a again right

365
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,800
come on look at me

366
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:44,959
and 1.0 look if i could read the list

367
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:50,160
1 over 1 plus so you'll be

368
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:53,440
a this will be a a divided by a plus

369
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:56,000
what a divided by a so would be one okay

370
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:59,279
it'll be like that and then if we if we

371
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,040
change this to a okay can this leads to

372
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,920
a

373
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:06,560
et cetera okay

374
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,959
we can do this iteratively yeah

375
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,880
it'll be easier to do this iteration how

376
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:13,440
can we do this

377
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:16,399
let's just write an announcement okay so

378
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,600
answer equal zero

379
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,360
four

380
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,519
underscore in

381
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,080
range

382
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,920
n

383
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:26,480
[Applause]

384
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,680
so now i just need to iterate how can i

385
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,560
iterate this

386
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,240
answer equals

387
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,880
what equals what

388
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,560
answer equals what a

389
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,959
divided by

390
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:42,240
a plus answer okay

391
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,240
that's it written answer

392
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:48,639
how how's that look i already have this

393
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:52,639
answer right so in the next iteration

394
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:55,040
i will be 8 divided by 8 plus answer

395
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,360
all right look at me why this is working

396
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,360
right

397
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:02,320
answer equals zero right

398
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:05,040
and an answer equals a minus a plus

399
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:07,360
answers look this is this bit is answer

400
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,360
yeah so in the next round i can use we

401
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,399
use the answer

402
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,360
in this a divided by a plus slab right

403
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,600
yeah

404
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,600
so

405
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,720
why why do we need to care about this

406
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,800
these values come on

407
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,399
why do we need to care about this on

408
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,839
this

409
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,720
do you know why

410
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,680
why

411
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:32,079
we want to calculate this value

412
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,639
yeah because this is a good

413
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:36,480
approximation if we keep doing that this

414
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,639
is approximation of

415
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,560
getting the value of square root of 5

416
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,880
here and this is getting the value of

417
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,800
square root of

418
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,000
3 okay

419
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,079
yeah

420
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,480
um yeah

421
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:52,720
so look

422
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,480
long long time ago yeah

423
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,920
we don't know the value of square root

424
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,839
of five how do you get how do you

425
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,279
approach me the square root of five how

426
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,360
do you calculate the square root of

427
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:04,920
three

428
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,920
how do you approximate

429
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,919
yeah we talked about this before yeah so

430
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,839
square root of 5

431
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,280
is

432
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:22,000
between four and

433
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:24,799
square root of nine nine yeah so it's

434
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,480
between two and three right yeah

435
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:29,840
it's already between two and three so i

436
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,880
can i can i can do this two plus

437
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:35,200
something

438
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:36,720
something square equals five okay

439
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,400
yeah

440
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:42,320
makes sense

441
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:46,240
so look this what's this 4 plus s square

442
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:48,480
plus 2 times a times b which is 4x

443
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,320
equals 5.

444
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,559
this is a very small path

445
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,400
so it's so small that we can ignore it

446
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:58,240
for now so let's ignore this term for

447
00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:00,200
now so 4 plus 4 times x equals 5

448
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:04,320
x equals 1

449
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:07,280
0.25 right so x means 0.35 so we have a

450
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:12,640
good x estimation is

451
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:15,280
x is 0.25 so 2 plus x is 2.25 okay

452
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:18,480
this is the first estimation right now

453
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,760
we can keep iterating this yeah

454
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,600
anyway look

455
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,160
look at this one

456
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,160
a plus b

457
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,720
square what's this

458
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:31,679
what's the value of this

459
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,799
a plus b square remember equals a

460
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,720
squared

461
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,160
plus b squared

462
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,400
plus one

463
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:41,840
let's have a square plus b squared plus

464
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,840
what come on so c squared two times a b

465
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,960
come on we talked about this before yeah

466
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,400
yeah

467
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,760
so look

468
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,160
2 plus x

469
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,880
x is the part that comes with the you

470
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,440
know

471
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,559
is the square root of 5 yeah 2 plus x

472
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:59,600
squared equals 5 so equals 4 plus

473
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:02,320
s square plus 4 times x equals 5

474
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:04,799
but because x is a fraction part so it's

475
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:07,600
so small that we know it for now so x is

476
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:10,720
0.25 and we can keep iterating it so

477
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:13,760
let's say 2.25 plus x

478
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:16,320
square equals 5 right you see

479
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,720
yeah so again we can square root of

480
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,039
these square root of this and we get an

481
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,280
adjustment term for that and we can keep

482
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,559
iterating it until we get a good

483
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,840
approximation

484
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,240
but for this one

485
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,160
we can just iterate for a few times for

486
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,640
few rounds and then get a good

487
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,640
estimation of square root of five and

488
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,880
with this one we get a good estimation

489
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,480
of two right

490
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,960
yeah

491
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,679
do you get it yeah

492
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,200
any questions over any questions

493
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,440
come on any questions

494
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,400
look if we run this if we run this then

495
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,480
we'll be

496
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,280
uh that would be a very good estimation

497
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,760
okay

498
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:55,360
very good estimation of the square root

499
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,880
okay

500
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,919
yeah

501
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,720
all right

502
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,600
that's it for today okay okay let me

503
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,080
show you

504
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,799
the thing on my computer

505
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:10,559
okay look we have this look

506
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:13,600
yeah we have implement list a f and g

507
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:16,159
if we call this function a hundred times

508
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,919
iterate times we got a very good

509
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:20,880
estimation okay

510
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:24,520
we get a very good estimation okay

511
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,520
that's it bye
