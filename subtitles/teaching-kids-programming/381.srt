1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
hello

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:06,879
hello hello hello mr mr right now all

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,120
right

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:11,200
hello hi

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,840
so we have to talk about the longest

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:18,480
trees remember a few days ago yeah

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:21,439
longest path in a tree in a binary tree

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,439
what's fine energy

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,800
what's financing

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,000
is a binary tree right

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,560
in the tree

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,719
it's you know this this is the loot here

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,760
growing downward these are the leaves

14
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,559
yeah

15
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,280
okay

16
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,520
so we want to find out the longest path

17
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,120
longest path is the path between any two

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,360
nodes so what's the how many what's the

19
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:47,680
longest path here

20
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,680
how many notes are in the longest part

21
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,480
anybody

22
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,320
what's the longest part here

23
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,840
let's say i put another number here

24
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,840
what's the longest pass

25
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,640
four or five yeah right two

26
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,799
one three three

27
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,799
seven right okay

28
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,040
yeah i will

29
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,479
we talk about the definition different

30
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,560
search the function remember the

31
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:18,720
function returns two things bfs root

32
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,520
the first of all this function returns

33
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,640
the number of the nodes the longest path

34
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:28,080
starting with the node right

35
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,880
and the function also computes stores

36
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,400
the maximum the longest path

37
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,320
between any two nodes because we're

38
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,640
passing that loop right

39
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,320
right let's quickly review this yeah if

40
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:42,240
not load

41
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:45,840
returns yellow yeah return zero because

42
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:51,280
if it's empty the longest path is zero

43
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,280
okay so left equals dfs rule down left

44
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,799
right equals dfs through the right okay

45
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:03,520
and then okay so we have our answer here

46
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,360
at the beginning is zero answer equals

47
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,479
maximum

48
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,439
answer

49
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,239
take no

50
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,920
okay so look here we are

51
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,920
at this point we are doing node here

52
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,720
right

53
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,800
dfs loader left is this bit

54
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,840
it's listed the longest path is the

55
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,160
speed yeah passing the route to the left

56
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,640
tfs root of right is the longest task

57
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:30,160
passing the do the right which is three

58
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,840
okay so here is air here is r

59
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,519
okay

60
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:39,120
so now the longest path passing the root

61
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:42,000
here 1 is equals to what

62
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,000
is equal to 1

63
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,560
l

64
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,400
plus

65
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,800
1 plus r

66
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,120
so here

67
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,200
right but now this function this

68
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,599
function will return the longest path

69
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,800
starting from the loop right

70
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,159
so

71
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,200
it means that

72
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:03,680
either the left or the right we want to

73
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,280
pick the maximum right all right

74
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,239
so return

75
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,480
maximum when we talk about this yeah air

76
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,760
r plus one right okay

77
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,360
look

78
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,120
these

79
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,720
and this a little bit different right

80
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,239
this is the two things this function

81
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,879
does

82
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,120
because it double search okay

83
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,640
okay now look this

84
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,040
three

85
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,959
what are three primary three dag what's

86
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:33,080
the az by the way any anybody do you

87
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,080
remember what's the iconic

88
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,239
errors are from the parents to the kids

89
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,799
in the boundary

90
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,840
yeah

91
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,840
yeah

92
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,840
because the final trick the trees are

93
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,000
usually you've needed the

94
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,920
children from my parents right let's

95
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,280
call it directly a cycling what does it

96
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,280
mean a cyclic

97
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,239
does it

98
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,720
what what's this what's happening

99
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,720
anybody

100
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:10,799
[Music]

101
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,799
but hey

102
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,799
a cyclic

103
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,799
means the opposite means doesn't have a

104
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,320
sign

105
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,320
a cyclic okay

106
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,759
the graph graph is basically a

107
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:27,919
collection of the vertical vertex and uh

108
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:30,160
okay vertex and edges yeah that's logic

109
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:32,320
okay oh vertex okay

110
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,880
can i show your face please

111
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,600
my face is a pikachu

112
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,600
okay so now

113
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,479
uh um

114
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,800
we also talk about we also talk about

115
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,880
converting the trees into the graph

116
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,720
right we also talk about what's the

117
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,240
advantage of converting the trees into

118
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,840
the graph anybody

119
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,320
you know why why do we need to convert

120
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,520
the trees into a graph because it's much

121
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,039
easier

122
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:03,120
much easier in sense of what

123
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:05,360
in terms of work much easier in sense of

124
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,360
what

125
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,680
look

126
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,360
as a tree we can only visit the para

127
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,360
tree like children from the parents

128
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,759
right but if we're converting the trees

129
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,320
into the graph then we can visit the

130
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,560
parents from the kids right so because

131
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,440
we when we convert the trees into a

132
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,639
graph

133
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,560
we're converting into a unique direction

134
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,400
but bi-directional graph right so it

135
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,680
means two-dimensional bi-directional

136
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,000
graph okay

137
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,039
bi-directional graph

138
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,199
right

139
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,479
like we we can use the definition of

140
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,800
preferences usually we use the

141
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,800
difference

142
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,880
and then we can

143
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,880
we can store the graph

144
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:50,320
in an adjacent list from the from the

145
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,680
parents to the kids and from kids to

146
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,360
parents right okay so today look

147
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,280
listen now this is the key point today

148
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,840
okay all right all right

149
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,319
what's the first what's the longest the

150
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:05,120
first the note i can travel from the

151
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,960
loop here from the lower one

152
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,440
what's the longest

153
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,639
uh the right

154
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,720
which number is it

155
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,080
what's the longest path i can travel

156
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,319
from here

157
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,199
if i walk here if i use the quest for

158
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,199
search

159
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,639
yeah what's the longest path i can

160
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,680
travel to

161
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:28,400
which note what's the longest point from

162
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,560
uh if i start from eight okay

163
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,720
okay then i go here

164
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,560
okay now what's the longest point if i

165
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,840
start here i can go

166
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,680
you know

167
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:41,759
visualizing this as a graph what's the

168
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,759
longest point if i can travel from here

169
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,759
uh one

170
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,280
what one

171
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,560
this is a graph

172
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,120
yeah

173
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,520
this is a quad what if one why can i go

174
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,280
further

175
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,360
because

176
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,680
don't worry this is the graph if i'm

177
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,880
here i'm doing a placement search

178
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,720
i'm here

179
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,720
and what's the longest place i can be

180
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,440
what's the longest pass i can be

181
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,639
seven

182
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,880
so

183
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:17,280
why is it three

184
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,199
yeah longest path don't worry about the

185
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:23,440
errors because it's it's a

186
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,440
two directional now it's a graph now

187
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,360
i'm here what's the longest place i can

188
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,440
be four

189
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,520
four okay

190
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,400
yeah

191
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:37,840
okay so i'm here here

192
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,039
so this is the longest path in the graph

193
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,120
you make sense

194
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,080
okay so how about idea

195
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,240
uh

196
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:47,360
okay this was um

197
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,759
so what did i just do i start with any

198
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,080
note right i do a definition of

199
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,919
breakfast search to be to go to the

200
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,879
service point item b

201
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,680
right

202
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:00,720
and then i do another different perfect

203
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,639
search and find another note

204
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,960
and these two

205
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,720
are the longest

206
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,120
the paths between these two notes are

207
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,599
the longest okay so let's let's give

208
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:15,479
another example okay

209
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,479
let's give another example

210
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,800
okay

211
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,080
okay so here i

212
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,039
let's say

213
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:42,880
let's say we start from the this place

214
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,880
yeah what's the longest path you can be

215
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,440
uh

216
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,320
the really

217
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,240
these are yeah okay

218
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,160
okay i'm i'm here what's the longest

219
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,279
house i can be

220
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:58,480
the really top left okay so the longest

221
00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:00,800
path will be the root between these two

222
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,040
okay

223
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,040
yeah

224
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,800
make sense

225
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:09,519
[Music]

226
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:12,000
make sense yeah

227
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,959
why this these approaches were working

228
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,360
why

229
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,600
look why this is working

230
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:21,480
can you find any other example that this

231
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,480
of course doesn't work

232
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,600
so the point of doing that is that doing

233
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,240
two different searches that we can we

234
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:33,440
allow we can allow these

235
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:37,760
you know going out of a

236
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:39,839
global a local local i mean

237
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,080
local optimum right

238
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,080
yeah

239
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,839
so let's find another maybe another

240
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:52,320
example okay maybe another example so

241
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,320
so i'm here i'm here um

242
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,519
i'm here so this is the local minimum

243
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,560
here

244
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,040
and now

245
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,640
i have something going wrong and wrong

246
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,800
and wrong

247
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:08,880
okay

248
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:11,120
yeah maybe uh let's say

249
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,839
but it should be a graph right

250
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,600
it should be no cycle because if it says

251
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,440
it's a cycle there's no longest part you

252
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,079
can if there's a cycle what's the

253
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,079
longest path

254
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:25,200
what's the longest part of laser

255
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,200
infinity infinity where down look if

256
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,360
it's because i can just go through wrong

257
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,680
and round and round right it's if it's a

258
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,600
circle right yeah

259
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,360
can i can i have your attention no no

260
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,360
too much noise please

261
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,560
okay so i'm trying actually i'm trying

262
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,959
to find out the example that uh you tell

263
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,839
us why this approach was if we pick any

264
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,640
note

265
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,959
and we do the longest the definition uh

266
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,839
longest path then it will work

267
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,839
so um

268
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,760
um maybe this is too obvious yeah

269
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,920
because they

270
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,000
any notes will pick this longest one

271
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,120
right so maybe this is not a very good

272
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,839
idea

273
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,079
so

274
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,079
uh

275
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:12,000
looks like a guy he has long hair yeah

276
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:14,160
yeah okay so look if we start from here

277
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,160
look

278
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,839
yeah look if we pick a no which is not

279
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:22,480
the terminal now right because usually

280
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,279
the terminal

281
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,090
right

282
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,399
if we put a note in the middle

283
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:29,440
[Music]

284
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:32,640
that is not the longest part

285
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,720
right if they look because we pick here

286
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,279
now what's the longest part you come to

287
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,279
this point here

288
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:43,560
yeah and now we can go through here

289
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:43,560
again the longest path will be

290
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,040
okay so here right

291
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,240
right

292
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,240
yeah so look

293
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,040
what what what's

294
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,959
why this is working okay um maybe i will

295
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:08,240
do this okay yeah one more note yeah so

296
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:12,480
look i start from here the longest path

297
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,480
the top one okay you will pick this one

298
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:19,360
okay i'm trying to pick another one here

299
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,920
look which is here okay

300
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,959
okay look the longest path

301
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:28,160
i start here you pick this one right why

302
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:29,279
because from here you go here they are

303
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,079
odd

304
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,839
so one two three four one two three four

305
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,200
okay i have another one

306
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,240
okay

307
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:40,800
okay so i said why we're done i'm here

308
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:44,160
right thank you very much all right and

309
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:47,440
then from here you go to here right yes

310
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:50,639
yeah look so so you see so the first

311
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:54,639
first test research first search

312
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:57,120
you allow the node to jump out out right

313
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,200
to find this uh find the furthest from

314
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,160
from here and then from these you can

315
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,399
see more area right we go from here to

316
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,639
and you will pick the path

317
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,639
okay

318
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,000
okay so can you tell me what's the

319
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,360
approach here why how can we find the

320
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,399
longest path it's because we always

321
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:21,279
um

322
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:21,279
that says grape not grass yeah graph

323
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,000
can you tell me

324
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,360
what did i just say here i don't know

325
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,480
yeah

326
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,600
um

327
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:42,639
the longest path is

328
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:45,360
when you pick a random note you always

329
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,959
like to choose

330
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,839
one

331
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,399
the that

332
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:51,760
it is yeah it's it's not easy to prove

333
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,519
right but but

334
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,360
by intuitive is

335
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,600
is that you pick a start you pick a

336
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,600
random note you do it you do whatever

337
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,600
search preferences to the longest part

338
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,600
yeah

339
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,560
yeah and then you start here you do

340
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:11,360
another one right okay so then you have

341
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,600
you have us to find the longest right

342
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,240
your helpers

343
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,480
you see you get the meaning yeah do you

344
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,959
understand yeah okay maybe i'll try

345
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:24,000
another one and then you tell me okay

346
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,800
i i just draw anyone and then you tell

347
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,399
me

348
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,720
what's the longest part i don't know

349
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,720
okay

350
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,760
i'm just guessing

351
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:37,279
okay what's the longest path here

352
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,279
can you try and continue

353
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:43,360
okay so six two three four five six

354
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,800
seven i guess seven okay so let's say if

355
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,639
i start from here right what's the

356
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:50,480
longest pass you can go

357
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:52,079
uh the top right one yeah okay here

358
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,199
and then here

359
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,199
i can go from

360
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,800
here right yeah so one two one two three

361
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,959
four five six seven well done okay

362
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,760
yeah so you found it yeah

363
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:10,000
okay so this is a simple strategy yeah

364
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,480
so look we can do this breakfast search

365
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,370
we can prefer search on only speed right

366
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,160
we can prefer searching with speed

367
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:18,720
[Music]

368
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,320
okay let's let's try this okay let's try

369
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,800
this

370
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,760
uh let me remove this bit okay because

371
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,760
we already seen this code before

372
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,600
and here

373
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,440
so first of all we want to convert the

374
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,680
graph into

375
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,279
convert the binary into the graph right

376
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,360
okay so let's say

377
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:40,000
g equals

378
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,160
t equals before dictionary okay we use

379
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,440
this uh

380
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:48,480
before dictionary this this is a note

381
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:52,240
right and now we can do this bfs

382
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:55,360
by passing the root and the parent

383
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:58,480
why do we need to pass the parent here

384
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,480
if not root return can you tell me i'm

385
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,880
trying to convert the tree into the

386
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,399
graph and i'm passing the parent

387
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,399
okay

388
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:09,920
return

389
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:11,920
okay and then we can say pls blue

390
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,120
dot left what's the parent of root of

391
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,320
that

392
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:19,959
root

393
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,959
and then i'm trying to dfs neutral right

394
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:24,980
[Music]

395
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,920
is parent right look the parent of loot

396
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:37,759
is para park okay so now we have part

397
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,600
then we want to construct an edge

398
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,680
between the parent and the root right so

399
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,000
if a parent could say

400
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:46,720
and then you call it perron

401
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,759
g parent he thought a pen

402
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,759
apparently right

403
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,320
and what's the next thing i want to add

404
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:05,320
another edge the reverse way so what's

405
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,320
that

406
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,779
[Music]

407
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,199
this one converting the trees to the

408
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:18,160
graph okay we use the g before

409
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:20,720
dictionary the key is the note the the

410
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:23,439
value is the list of the vertex notes

411
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,520
yeah it connects to make sense

412
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:28,079
okay

413
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:30,400
the tangent let's see for this one

414
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,400
what's the time complexity we'll try to

415
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,250
convert the trees to into graph what's

416
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,720
the time to react

417
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:36,880
[Music]

418
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,559
because there are any nodes and nodes

419
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,240
that will be mapped to

420
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,240
map to end vertex okay

421
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:49,200
what did you say he you said

422
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,600
um

423
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,799
we can use the

424
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,799
trade in the parity

425
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,520
okay

426
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:01,760
the the term conduction space convex is

427
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,360
om because we are visiting the endnotes

428
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,600
in the tree and we are converting the

429
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:08,400
nodes into a vertex in a biology we call

430
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,200
it a node in a graph we call it vertex

431
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,640

vertex

433
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,679
edges we are having two edges

434
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,210
apparent to lose room to pattern okay

435
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,720
both way two direction

[Music]

437
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,760
oh now okay so now

438
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:26,240
we once we have this graph ready then we

439
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,160
need to do this breakfast search when we

440
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,400
have this preferred search all we can do

441
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,160
is search it doesn't matter and we start

442
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,559
with the loot right

443
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:37,360
right and we want these functions to

444
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:39,440
return the furthest point from dude

445
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,320
and the distance yeah it makes sense

446
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,799
look remember

447
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,640
remember this yeah we start with any log

448
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,600
this could be no

449
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,760
right

450
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,880
and then you tell me the furthest point

451
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,440
is here

452
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,919
yeah you return a top up the first value

453
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,240
is the first one the second value is the

454
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:00,160
distance to it so that would be one two

455
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,559
three four five six

456
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,440
make sense so this function will tell me

457
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,320
that

458
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,480
right

459
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,000
and how does that useful look if this

460
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,960
function return that and what should i

461
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,799
do look all right all right

462
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,799
come on this is this okay don't worry

463
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:16,160
about the implementation about this one

464
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,080
is loot right

465
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,320
this is good

466
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,600
and then this function will return uh to

467
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,360
a tupper

468
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,960
so i can do this look

469
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:29,120
the first response

470
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:31,520
the first response first is f u r t h

471
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:35,840
it first and the distance

472
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,840
equals p f s root right

473
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:41,120
and then you tell me it's this bit

474
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,720
okay the first third is the number will

475
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,640
go to this bit yeah

476
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,039
this is the forest you'll turn me first

477
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,200
and the distance will be one two three

478
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,960
four five six six

479
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,200
okay and then what's the next thing

480
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,799
what's the next thing i should do

481
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,630
what's the next thing i call this value

482
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,799
what's the next thing

483
00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:01,600
[Music]

484
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,600
do another one

485
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:07,440
and then i need to do this one look bfs

486
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,240
furries

487
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,159
okay

488
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,480
look i do the flowers and then return to

489
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:15,120
value which is another one i don't care

490
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,480
understood and okay and then i'll be the

491
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,400
distance

492
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,200
and i just need to return the distance

493
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,440
okay

494
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:24,159
because after this you will tell me the

495
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:27,520
first one is here this is another one

496
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:30,480
let's say a okay here is a and

497
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:33,120
here is a okay the distance will be

498
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,120
one two three four five six seven eight

499
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,559
okay distance will be eight

500
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,440
do you get it

501
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:41,760
i'm calling it suppressor search twice

502
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,760
yeah

503
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,559
make sense

504
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,880
okay

505
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,880
what

506
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:06,559
okay now the breakfast search okay so uh

507
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,320
let's implement professor how can we

508
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:10,159
implement the personal search there's

509
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:15,440
one data structure we need to use which

510
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:17,760
is what q q i know yeah q equals pq

511
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,760
and then let's

512
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,559
at the beginning we need to put the root

513
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,919
and then the number of nodes is one here

514
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:26,240
that's a temper

515
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:28,159
and we want to find we because in the

516
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,559
graph we need to we need another data

517
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,240
structure to find out if we have visited

518
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:34,880
the nodes before and what can they what

519
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:37,280
kind of data structure is would that be

520
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,919
that the the thing that that asks to

521
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,520
check if we have visited a node before

522
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:44,880
what would that be

523
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,400
notebook a hash set okay equals headset

524
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,679
a set

525
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,520
and then let's say answer equals the

526
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:55,200
okay so then the file is let's say the

527
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:58,559
first first let's just go in for this

528
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,960
equals root and distance

529
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:02,720
equals one okay one node it's actually

530
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,280
not the distance is the number of nodes

531
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,559
okay and then now we can say y

532
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,000
q

533
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:11,440
and current

534
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,280
t equals q dot pop left

535
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,240
okay and then

536
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:18,240
we want to find out look if d bigger

537
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,799
than the distance

538
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,720
the number of notes then distance equals

539
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:25,039
d

540
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,360
and series we store the first point at

541
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:29,440
this point and which is current and then

542
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:32,400
let's say we want to find out the next

543
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:35,039
the the the nodes it connects to so for

544
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,919
n in g

545
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,919
g current

546
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:46,159
if and not in sin okay not easy

547
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,840
sing the ad

548
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:51,600
and and now we want to push these

549
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:54,159
appendix to the queue so q dot append

550
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,840
a pen one append the next note is n and

551
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,400
the distance the number of notes

552
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,679
increasing will be d plus one right

553
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,600
okay and then

554
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:04,400
later would we turn

555
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:06,640
attacker first

556
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,720
and then this time

557
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,000
okay you see

558
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,960
first massage

559
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,760
yeah

560
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,760
a perfect search

561
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,919
okay so what have you learned so far

562
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,799
today

563
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:23,440
about the longest path

564
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:24,720
longest search

565
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,400
we can use the

566
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,159
actually we can use the different search

567
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,480
here as well right

568
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:32,799
even we can use the depth research to a

569
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,720
breakfast search look at the beginning

570
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:36,480
we use the test research to convert the

571
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,159
trees into the graph we can use the

572
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,600
pressure search at the point as well

573
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,720
right

574
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,840
yeah

575
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:46,159
we are using preferences to travel to to

576
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:48,320
do this traversal to the longest path to

577
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:50,159
the longest point from the loop from the

578
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,320
current node right we can also use

579
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,720
staffordsearch to do it the key points

580
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,480
today is that how do you find the

581
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,080
longest path

582
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,159
yeah

583
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,559
we start with any node

584
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:05,520
we can go to the furthest point

585
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:07,600
from here and now we start at that point

586
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,200
to do another

587
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,559
you know traversal yeah we can do the

588
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,600
different social preferences from that

589
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,159
point

590
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:16,720
yeah remember this graph right the time

591
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:19,039
complexity is o n

592
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,120
but for search we do it twice

593
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,240
it's out to n we drop the constant which

594
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,159
is o n

595
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,320
right the space complexity obviously

596
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,720
always right we have we need

597
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,799
a hash say headset number to store the

598
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,880
number of nodes we have theme

599
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:35,039
yeah we're converting we we are

600
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,440
converting the trees into the graph we

601
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:40,880
also need the data structure to store

602
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:43,440
the graph right graph vertex and edges

603
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:46,000
okay so look the number of vertex is n

604
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:48,159
the number of edges is what the number

605
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,679
of edges

606
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:52,000
if a tree has three notes what's the

607
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,840
number of the edges the maximum edges

608
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,600
okay the one last question

609
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,840
if a tree

610
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:01,520
if a final tree

611
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:03,360
has n node how many edges are there

612
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,200
the the maximum

613
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,440
they are one two three four five six

614
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,520
seven

615
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,600
so it's it's a is a

616
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,880
magnitude of n right

617
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,120
something like that look because it

618
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:18,960
doesn't have cycle one two three four

619
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:21,039
five six one two three four five six

620
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:24,159
one two three four five six seven yeah

621
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:26,559
okay you're right okay look and if i 9

622
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,559
on the one

623
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,679
one two three four five six seven eight

624
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,679
eight edges how many notes are there

625
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,200
one two three four five six seven eight

626
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,600
nine okay

627
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,840
yeah you know why is that

628
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,840
why is that i'm

629
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,480
a

630
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:46,159
tree a tree with n nose has n minus one

631
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,080
edges am i right

632
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,400
yes

633
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,600
why is that look consider this one three

634
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,520
notes

635
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,880
n minus one edges

636
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,039
all right look

637
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,919
why is it n minus one if i add in one

638
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,919
more what happened

639
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,840
look n note i'm adding if they are

640
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:08,240
unknown here

641
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:11,679
n minus one edges

642
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:13,520
if i add one edges what happened

643
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:14,880
you'll be having that will be sagar okay

644
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,760
so v e

645
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,760
is also n right we're storing the

646
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,000
nodes and the graph okay

647
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,000
okay

648
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,600
everyone

649
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,360
okay so can you tell me what have you

650
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,210
learned so far today the last question

651
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:32,240
please may not be

652
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:33,760
[Music]

653
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,559
what's the problem we're trying to solve

654
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,919
here

655
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:38,720
longest

656
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:40,880
past longest pass and how are we doing

657
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,880
it

658
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,159
longer

659
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,320
and then

660
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:55,520
okay we're done good job that's it for

661
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:57,760
today good job bye bye bye
