1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,439
hello hello mr away are you all right

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,000
yes okay so today

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,879
we talk about a link list so remember

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,080
link is

5
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:13,120
yeah that's one two

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:16,240
three four

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:19,359
and another five okay so easy okay so

8
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:22,400
here is the empty near yeah

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:26,560
none okay the end that's the head

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:29,439
that's the head that's the head

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,240
okay so easy i want you to do it like

12
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,280
that

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:36,480
every two i think we've done that before

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,600
which one today is a simple task swap

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,399
these two so

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:45,120
becomes two one swap each for a pair

17
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,879
four three and then if they're only one

18
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,559
left they just keep it

19
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,079
right if there's six here you swap it

20
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,239
right if they are odd

21
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,160
each number you forget about the last

22
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,239
one if you are even number you just swap

23
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:00,960
everything in pairs

24
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:05,280
right okay does it make sense this one

25
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,280
yeah how can we do this

26
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,840
okay so how can we do this easy one one

27
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,560
easy solution

28
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,360
okay it's a brief thing yeah just do

29
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,759
whatever t

30
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,880
says right so how can we swap this we

31
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,200
can swap them

32
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,479
how can we make this to one for example

33
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,960
if it's one

34
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,960
i know

35
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,720
that's one way and how about the other

36
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,240
one i kick

37
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:40,159
yeah you can reverse it right yeah or

38
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:43,200
we can simply what we can simply what

39
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:45,600
how do you make this here

40
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,399
if i don't take i'll tell you the note

41
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,560
that the link

42
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,960
is that stays the same and what what

43
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:55,759
needs to be checked

44
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,759
a link is a link node a link alone

45
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:04,479
no no no no no no

46
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,479
swap what what

47
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,959
a note contains the value

48
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,720
the value yeah and the link right you're

49
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,560
talking about reverse the link that's

50
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,760
one solution the other one is i just

51
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,400
swap the

52
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,640
value right so how about it look if i

53
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,640
have these

54
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,160
i swap these and the value of the next

55
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,480
one and then after i swap it

56
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:33,440
i move two yeah okay

57
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:36,480
i move two okay so that's one way okay

58
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:39,120
how many ways maybe

59
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,800
more than three ways maybe today we talk

60
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,910
about two ways

61
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,000
yeah look defined

62
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:47,280
[Music]

63
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,720
swap let's know okay and how can

64
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:55,680
let's do this head equals not

65
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,680
an unlock wire head

66
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,200
and has an x

67
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:06,159
what does it mean if this node if i have

68
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,959
this now and the current note

69
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,000
look this is head and this is height on

70
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,840
next right

71
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,280
right head and head the next and then i

72
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,640
need to swap one so

73
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,120
the value of head and hand on this right

74
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,319
so how do we solve it head remember head

75
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,080
of value

76
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:27,599
comma head down next

77
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:30,799
top value equals one how do we say

78
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:33,840
how do we swap these two

79
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,440
height of value and hit the next value i

80
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,720
want to solve these two how do i solve

81
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,159
it because

82
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:43,200
the value equals value yeah

83
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,080
yeah and then after i swap this what

84
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,280
should i do i have

85
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,720
equals what i swapped

86
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,560
these two what should i do first i'll

87
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,000
move to this head

88
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,439
i should move it to where i should move

89
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,360
it to where

90
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:00,720
i'm here head i slowly already swap

91
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,920
these two i know what happened what's

92
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,480
your move

93
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,599
this is high what should i move two what

94
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,560
two

95
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,959
plus two there's no plus two head down

96
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,920
next

97
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,879
stop next next hey because head dot net

98
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,760
dot next

99
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:17,759
yeah donate to the next that's it and

100
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:21,040
return

101
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:23,919
return note okay that's it what's the

102
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,919
time complexity

103
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:33,120
if there are notes in the linked easy

104
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,479
yeah what's the space community do we

105
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,400
need action yeah

106
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,840
okay so that's one way okay the other

107
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,160
way you say the problem

108
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,040
you are you said upon uh reverse the

109
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,479
link yeah

110
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:47,199
yeah okay so i this one is a bit tricky

111
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,199
look look look

112
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,639
okay i i don't care okay the first thing

113
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,960
to do is what

114
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,320
this is something else the first thing

115
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,280
to do is reverse

116
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,759
these to make these links to here right

117
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,840
i want to i want to do what i want to

118
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,800
i want to make this link here right

119
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,320
right

120
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,560
all right yeah and then these needs to

121
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,080
links to somewhere here right

122
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,000
this is recursion i can do this

123
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,360
recursion right all i

124
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,840
do i have to do is reverse the ring okay

125
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:26,080
and i return this all right huh

126
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:28,639
look this is one this is two

127
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,600
yeah all i have to do is dive this is

128
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,680
still one is

129
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,639
i just have to reverse this link

130
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,800
pointing to

131
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,360
backwards right instead probably i'm

132
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,479
pretty well and i cut this link here

133
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,199
yeah i i remove this link here but i

134
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,840
need to point

135
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,680
these links to somewhere this is little

136
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,240
cushion i can recursion it

137
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,000
so please all right got it that's gonna

138
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,240
be a weird link

139
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
no no no no you don't care about these

140
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,080
can be done

141
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,720
can be worried later about recursion

142
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,120
right all i have to do is solving one's

143
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,759
problem at the same time solving one's

144
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,039
most

145
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:08,639
problem which is to

146
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:10,560
reverse list link right original is 1.2

147
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,080
points or something else and now i just

148
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,319
want to make it two points

149
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,120
one and one points to something else

150
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:21,039
right

151
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:24,639
got it yeah yeah okay that's easy

152
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:29,280
so look if first of all if note is

153
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,280
empty all there are only one node

154
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,400
yeah then i just simply return it's

155
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,400
there right

156
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,759
if there's only one note i don't need to

157
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,160
do anything all right

158
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,240
yeah if there's only one note how can

159
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,840
you we just return it and then now

160
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,960
that's the tricky part okay

161
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:52,720
so first of all tear

162
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:56,479
hair is remember this here

163
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:58,800
pencil tails tail is this bit okay

164
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,520
this is this is no dot next to the next

165
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,560
one

166
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,560
tail equals what

167
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,759
yeah because i'm solving i'm calling

168
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:20,880
yourself to solve this part right

169
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:23,199
now i know i what what

170
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,400
what's this bit the head is what that

171
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,319
new head

172
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,319
new hair equals another next right

173
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,160
this is the new head yeah no no the next

174
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:38,319
so this is the new head okay

175
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:41,360
and okay now head down next

176
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,720
at the next have the next original

177
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,080
points to that right

178
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:49,120
i need to point this back to what

179
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:52,240
to know right yeah

180
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:56,319
equals no right right

181
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,319
and then no no don't x equals one

182
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,599
no no next week what's what now the next

183
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,160
year what should i point it to

184
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,879
can you where down here is this video

185
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,919
way down

186
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,840
that's here correct right

187
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,000
and then these points to here these

188
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,479
points here and i need to return what

189
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,479
we've got

190
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:23,919
return this or this reason why

191
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,080
return head yes yes look here it goes

192
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,000
back here to equals another next no

193
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,840
hat or next equals no right here don't

194
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,400
necessarily know the next equals tail

195
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,519
right

196
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,560
now the next equals 10 we can have yes

197
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:39,760
does it make sense yeah okay

198
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,000
make sense make sense which one you

199
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,919
think

200
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,360
you can implement without if i i give

201
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,440
you two why is it

202
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,360
solve the value in pair the other one is

203
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,000
reverse the link in recursion which one

204
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,080
you think

205
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,680
you can do okay

206
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,600
yeah that one is more straightforward

207
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,000
yeah yeah

208
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,680
another way i don't want to write it but

209
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,720
you can keep in mind the other way is to

210
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,920
convert the linked list into a list yeah

211
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,040
if i convert it

212
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:09,600
if i put a lot in english into a list

213
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,360
right it's into a list and then i can

214
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,959
swap each value and convert it back to

215
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,959
the link list right

216
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,880
yeah that's one way okay so you tell me

217
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:20,000
the first one how to do it

218
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:23,440
okay head equals no

219
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:27,040
okay let's watch you tell me

220
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:31,279
why um

221
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:34,320
um wait head here

222
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:36,959
okay so this is head the head

223
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,959
next thing i

224
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,680
yeah means that if they have two notes

225
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:48,080
your head and head

226
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:51,040
next right yeah i know what should i do

227
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,040
what should i do i have

228
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,070
[Music]

229
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:11,600
head the value call my head already

230
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:14,000
and then what will happen um

231
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,920
i'm right here what should i do what's

232
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,839
your

233
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,839
head equals head down next or next

234
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:27,360
that's it only 10 no you don't know

235
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,279
because we haven't changed the note yeah

236
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,120
we just swap the value yeah

237
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,320
yeah we're done good job that's it for

238
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,000
today good job

239
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,000
bye bye
