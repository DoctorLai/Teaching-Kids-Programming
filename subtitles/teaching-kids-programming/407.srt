operating system yeah it's a huge

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,960
graphic user interface that allow us to

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,599
interact with the computer look this is

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,160
the photo and then i can create a new

12
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:30,640
photo right let's say eric and i click i

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,840
can create another photo called ryan

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,680
right

15
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,760
[Music]

date what's day

240
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,480
what's the meaning of date uh the day

241
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,800
or a day yeah look it gives you the

242
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,519
house it gives us the date yeah and the

243
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,399
time the time day yeah it's

244
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,000
so

245
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,399
so what's the difference between this

246
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,120
way of controlling the

247
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:59,839
computer or and this way

248
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,120
you're using a mouse to click

249
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:05,200
which one do you think it's more

250
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:07,120
powerful which one is more user friendly

251
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,880
this one is more powerful right

252
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,440
this one is more user-friendly right

253
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:14,240
yeah yeah yeah yeah because graph user

254
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,720
interface is for like non-programmers

255
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:20,160
like mommy yeah mommy just like to use

256
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:23,600
the mouse to to click yeah to do the

257
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:25,760
daily work but this is for computers for

258
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,320
us engineering yeah because we can use

259
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,959
the powerful commands to

260
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,360
you know to do more complex

261
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,200
task which cannot be done in graph user

262
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,240
interface doesn't make sense

263
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,600
okay

264
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,959
yeah make sense

265
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:43,920
yeah for example i want to display look

266
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:46,399
look i want to display like uh hello

267
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,959
hello ten times how can i do it

268
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,600
we do it like 10 times okay so we can

269
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:54,240
use the four here here we have four okay

270
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,760
so okay so what's the syntax for i

271
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,839
i i i i

272
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,079
tend to sequence

273
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,079
10.

274
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,440
uh

275
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,800
okay so this is this command is not

276
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,839
quite

277
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,120
uh i forgot the syntax actually it's

278
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,640
that command

279
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,480
oh okay okay it's 4i in

280
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,519
sequence one ten

281
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,640
one

282
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,420
two

283
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,040
okay echo hollow

284
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:26,200
[Music]

285
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:30,800
uh okay so it does okay maybe i think i

286
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:32,720
think a bit you your brain went a bit

287
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,120
okay

288
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,959
what's that one i think one

289
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,240
one

290
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:41,600
ten one okay one two one okay

291
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,399
uh

292
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,519
okay so i forgot let's let's say see the

293
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,360
command of

294
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,440
seq what does this say

295
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,680
uh first increment last okay so the

296
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,120
parameter sequence is not right okay for

297
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,839
i in

298
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,560
in

299
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:01,120
sequence first increment last right boom

300
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,440
echo hello

301
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,839
you give me ten times yeah you see yeah

302
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,880
but you go wrong last time yeah i know

303
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,760
but look

304
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:12,639
the command i show is mine is to show

305
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:15,519
the manual of a command let's say man of

306
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:17,240
cd change directory uh it doesn't have a

307
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,680
man

308
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:22,160
[Music]

309
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,000
cd right no no because these commands so

310
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,399
simple that they they don't there there

311
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,320
was even there wasn't even a menu for it

312
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,079
that man removed let's see if they don't

313
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,920

yeah it gives us the the manual the hep

316
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,600
yeah it gives us what's this command

317
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:42,079
used for and then the options like look

318
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,000
with dash f means first yeah and then we

319
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:46,079
show a dash r because it removes

320
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,959
directory in the contents because yeah

321
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,079
got it

322
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,480
yeah

323
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:53,120
okay so so

324
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,440

so that's a summary

328
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,040

let's say cat

330
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,680

331
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,920
cd changes directory cd dot means

332
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:13,200
