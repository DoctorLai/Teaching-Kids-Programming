1
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:08,000
[Music]

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,440
okay so

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,120
we want to draw remember we talked about

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:17,080
the total graphics so we want to draw a

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,080
style like that

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,840
okay so it's actually

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,400
better it is something like

8
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,040
that

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,120
and this is the star okay so let's just

10
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,760
start yeah forget about this this is

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,040
look looks like the tilted yeah

12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,760
okay so

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,719
how do we draw this how do we draw it i

14
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,600
mean using the logo yeah logo

15
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,559
graphics so if the total is here that is

16
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,360
here

17
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:55,440
yeah or a man yeah

18
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,719
so if this side is 100 100 meters go 100

19
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,719
meters

20
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:02,079
then you'll be pointing

21
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:04,320
the where and then in this tennis angle

22
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:07,520
suppose there's an angle

23
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:10,000
something angle right we don't know yet

24
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,880
and then we go another 100 meters yeah

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,119
this size is also 100 meters

26
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,280
and it'll be pointing that way and only

27
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,280
10 and then which is the same yeah this

28
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,520
angle is less than angle

29
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,680
yeah again again again repeat five times

30
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,680
and repeat

31
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,040
five times

32
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:33,439
fd 100 meter

33
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,880
turn right angle we don't know yet okay

34
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,479
so today we're going to find out this

35
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,119
angle

36
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,680
this is logo we can use the turtle yeah

37
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,840
we can say impression we can say from

38
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,920
turtle we talked about this a few days

39
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,280
ago import

40
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:52,159
we just need to function fd

41
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,920
to forward and then right

42
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,520
to turn right for the tester to turn

43
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,479
right all right

44
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,600
so

45
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:02,960
in python we can use the for loop for

46
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,880
underscore in range

47
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,520
five times

48
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,160
then fd 100

49
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,280
and right angle okay we need to put an

50
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,200
angle

51
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,440
in degree

52
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,440
okay

53
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,480
makes sense so far yeah so far so good

54
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,680
yeah

55
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,680
okay so

56
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,599
so

57
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,680
what's this this thing what's here

58
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,680
what's this ow what's this

59
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,959
upside down

60
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,959
five sides

61
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,760
this is pentagon okay so we call this a

62
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:51,200
polygon as well yeah probably again

63
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,239
very good yeah when n is bigger or equal

64
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,879
than three

65
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,879
when a is three that's not right

66
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,599
p o l five

67
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,840
okay well okay when n is three it's a

68
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,360
triangle yeah

69
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,319
when n is

70
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,319
is closed

71
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,040
yeah it could be square it could be

72
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:15,120
rectangular it could be

73
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:18,480
parallelogram gradient yeah or literally

74
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,800
kite yeah many many yeah many a diamond

75
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,280
or okay

76
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,280
what's that

77
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:33,360
i see okay okay okay so look four sided

78
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,080
many many shape okay and then five sides

79
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,760
it will be pentagon

80
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,920
okay six sided

81
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,720
hexagon

82
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,720
seven sided

83
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,120
head chicken okay

84
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,000
i don't know how to draw i remember

85
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,159
anyway i decided okay

86
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,410
again

87
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,760
okay

88
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:56,400
[Music]

89
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,640
okay a nice idea

90
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,959
i don't want the gun no no again no okay

91
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,959
and ten

92
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,400
okay so what's the

93
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,239
what's the internal angle the sum of

94
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,360
internal angle sum

95
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,280
of

96
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:21,280
total internet angle internet

97
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,880
into interior at internal angle

98
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,199
okay

99
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,199
what's the sum of it what's the sum

100
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,960
of the

101
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,800
internet angle of the

102
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,880
of the triangle

103
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,880
anybody

104
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,040
anybody comes

105
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,440
alright

106
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,880
anybody what's the size 100

107
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:46,160
80 yes 100 how can we prove that

108
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,520
we draw a parallel line

109
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,160
yeah

110
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:53,040
why we draw this look draw this the

111
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,520
least angle is equal to this angle

112
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,880
this angle is equal to this angle

113
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,240
so what's the

114
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,840
angle

115
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:05,280
180 of the line yeah look this is 180

116
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:08,400
this is 90 degrees okay

117
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,800
perpetual perpetual line 90 degrees a

118
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,120
straight line 180 degree

119
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,960
so look this angle is equal to this

120
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,840
thing this angle is equal to length so

121
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,759
the triangle 180 degree

122
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,000
all right how about square how about any

123
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,560
four sided square

124
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,800
these what's this what's the sum of

125
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:30,080
total 3

126
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,280
how do we prove it because um two

127
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,960
triangles

128
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,479
two triangles exactly look if we

129
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,880
separate it

130
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,880
ryan

131
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,720
how many triangles do we have

132
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,360
um

133
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:52,199
240.

134
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,199
um

135
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,919
two triangles each triangle is 182

136
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,919
triangle

137
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,240
360. yeah look at for any false id i can

138
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,639
just

139
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,360
cut it into two triangles yeah all right

140
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:14,240
so why can't it look this triangle

141
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:18,240
180 this triangle 180 so all these

142
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:22,000
things yeah okay how about five sided

143
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,520
depends how many triangle can you do

144
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,720
uh

145
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,400
okay

146
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,800
how many triangles

147
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:32,000
can we separate these pentagon

148
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:34,400
three yeah three

149
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,520
hexagons how many triangles

150
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,639
two

151
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,720
oh yeah

152
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,960
okay

153
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:44,479
so what what do we get

154
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:46,880
for anxiety if n for n side is

155
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:49,280
how many triangles can we have

156
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,319
for anxiety how many triangles

157
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,080
and

158
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:57,360
anxiety how many triangles okay look um

159
00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:00,000
minus two way down minus two n minus two

160
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,160
okay so the number of the total the sum

161
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,199
of the total integrity degrees n minus 2

162
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,840
times

163
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,080
180 yeah

164
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,479
this is the equation okay

165
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,960
pentagon

166
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:16,400
n equals three five yeah five minus two

167
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,880
three three times 180 540

168
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,360
hexagon

169
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,840
mexican home how many has hex can n

170
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,280
equals six six minus two

171
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,520
times a hundred eighty seven three

172
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,919
hundred that deck again

173
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,160
what's this again ten

174
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,520
ten minus two eight eight times a

175
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,280
hundred eighty

176
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:39,039
um one thousand four hundred and sixty

177
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,199
okay i'm the final number one thousand

178
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:45,639
four hundred sixty one hundred four

179
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,639
hundred okay okay yeah

180
00:07:55,850 --> 00:08:03,599
[Music]

181
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:06,080
okay so one thing we learned today okay

182
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,680
this is very northern n minus two i'll

183
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,560
write it here yeah

184
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,000
yeah

185
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,800
you should be able to tell your friend

186
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,800
what's this yeah

187
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,360
okay you should be able to take this is

188
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,840
very important yeah triangle n equals

189
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,479
three 180 degree

190
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,440
square n equals four four times minus

191
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,919
two

192
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,160
yeah because this n minus 2 is the

193
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,000
number of triangles we can partition the

194
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,080
polygon

195
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,800
all right okay

196
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,800
okay so look

197
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,039
this one look what's the difference

198
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,719
between these

199
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:46,000
this square okay

200
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,920
and it's dark what's the difference

201
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,040
what's the difference between these two

202
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,880
um

203
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,040
can you tell me the difference come on

204
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,640
what's the difference if i want to use

205
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:59,600
the something to differentiate these two

206
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:01,920
shapes yeah in order for it yeah this is

207
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,480
the only difference i mean this is the

208
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:07,760
one that stands out from the rest

209
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,920
because it has

210
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,160
so what's that in bit

211
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:15,839
can you describe okay look look these

212
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:17,440
are it's over 180 degrees we're done wow

213
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,760
clever yes

214
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,640
yeah if we have a one internal angle

215
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,160
which is over 180 degree we call it

216
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,480
concave

217
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,800
concave pumpkin

218
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,399
concave what's concave

219
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,440
means that if there's internet angle

220
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:35,360
which is over 100 otherwise this one

221
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,880
all the internal angles are less than

222
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,720
180 yeah so we call it convex so these

223
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:44,000
are two different okay

224
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:47,760
yeah concave and convex make sense

225
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,760
concave polygon pentagon

226
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,800
this is convex concave

227
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,440
um

228
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,959
okay and how about

229
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,480
this one almost

230
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,120
one two

231
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,279
three four four one two three four five

232
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,399
okay actually i throw one more one but

233
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:14,480
let's contact concave yeah okay

234
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:17,040
exactly okay both of these two are

235
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,440
called simple polygons simple

236
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,440
you know simple polygon is that it does

237
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,560
not intersect with each other this is

238
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,800
not a

239
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,360
this is not a simple polygon because it

240
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:30,000
intersects with it does not have hole so

241
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,680
it does not have a hose

242
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,760
so it does not have a hole this is not a

243
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,839
simple formula yeah

244
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,640
not intersecting with each other like

245
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,640
this yeah because

246
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,200
these two con are called simple polygons

247
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,839
yeah because it does not intersect

248
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,959
without each other okay

249
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,240
exactly okay we

250
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,480
talked about the shape yeah these are

251
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,959
the shapes okay so now the most

252
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:56,480
important thing of the day is what we

253
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:58,399
want to find out is this angle

254
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,839
the star

255
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,600
because remember we want to find out

256
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,120
this angle

257
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,720
yeah

258
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,399
yeah

259
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,920
okay

260
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,079
so

261
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,640
this is the pentagon okay so if each

262
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:15,680
side is equal then each angle is equal

263
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,440
right look but this is triangular if i

264
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,120
say this these three sides are equal

265
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,600
what's the what's the degree of what's

266
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:26,040
the angle of each angle

267
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,040
what's the angle of each angle come on

268
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:36,880
60 we're done because look wow a plus b

269
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:39,279
plus c equals 180 f a equals b equals c

270
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:43,040
so three times something equals 180

271
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:43,040
that's something the angle is 60

272
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:51,519
what's the angle of each of these

273
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:54,320
independent which each side equal

274
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,279
what's what's the angle of this can you

275
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,480
tell me

276
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,600
um

277
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,600
ryan 100

278
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,519
what's the internal sum when n equals

279
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,880
five

280
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:10,959
five minus two times 180 equals

281
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:14,959
540 orders five angles added up to 540

282
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:17,440
so which 108 yeah 540 divided by 5 yeah

283
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:20,240
because i find angles so it's 108 okay

284
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,240
this is 100 this angle is 100

285
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,480
so this 100

286
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,720
this angle is 72 right because these two

287
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:30,959
added up to

288
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:33,120
80 yeah yeah so this one is 72 i swear

289
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:35,920
so what's this angle come on

290
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,880
you almost almost get it

291
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:41,519
look okay i'm going to i'm going to

292
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:44,000
put a simple version there

293
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,560
look okay

294
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,760
first of all

295
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:53,920
let me let me write something yeah

296
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:55,760
okay yeah come on this this is a this is

297
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:59,440
d this is c

298
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,440
and let's say this d okay

299
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:07,279
if i tell you

300
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,279
angle a plus

301
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:14,160
a plus and b equals 180

302
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,720
yeah

303
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,639
come on everyone

304
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:22,480
and what's the angle of

305
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,480
what's the end of acd

306
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,880
angle a plus angle b equals 180 what's

307
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:31,279
the end of acd here

308
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,279
come on

309
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:38,560
ryan come on ryan

310
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:41,440
do you get this come on ryan you you

311
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,440
probably know this

312
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:48,160
a plus b equals 180 oh no no actually

313
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:49,680
it's not 180 it must not be a hundred a

314
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:53,760
hundred okay

315
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:55,519
a plus p equals 100 degrees

316
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:59,440
eight

317
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,440
and what's the end of this um

318
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,560
look i like it

319
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:08,570
[Music]

320
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,199
okay

321
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,839
look

322
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:26,399
because this angle

323
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:31,839
look because a plus b plus c

324
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:31,839
is 180 yeah yeah and then is c

325
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,399
a c d equals 180 right

326
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:41,920
look at that both have this c

327
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:44,560
right so this angle must be equal to

328
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:47,040
a plus b okay okay

329
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,040
okay so no no look if you understand

330
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:52,639
this right

331
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,560
72 72 so what's this degree come on 72

332
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:57,560
32 what's this

333
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,560

[Music]

336
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:27,720
144 okay so what's the

337
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:34,079
so look so how do we

338
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,759
how do we draw a star repeat

339
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:38,000
five times

340
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:41,759
fd 144

341
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,880
uh a hundred this is the size and right

342
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:47,440
turn right

343
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,440
144 yeah all right yeah

344
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,320
145 look harry how do we get 144 this is

345
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,120
we wanted here we were facing facing

346
00:15:54,320 --> 00:16:00,480
this direction and i want to turn

347
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,160
look at me 10 144 degrees

348
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,199
go straight

349
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,320
10 and under 544 degrees here go

350
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,600
straight

351
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,240
10

352
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,959
wait look at me okay

353
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,839
yeah close three and ten

354
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,959
yeah and ten okay so this is the 140

355
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,199
vertical

356
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,480
yeah yeah okay so this is what we

357
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,399
learned today so what have you learned

358
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,680
today come on what have you learned

359
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,360
today

360
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,519
anybody

361
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,720
angles yeah we're down this angle n

362
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:32,399
minus 2 times 180 and we also said then

363
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,360
concave convex

364
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:38,399
simple polygon okay so can you draw or

365
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,240
concave polygon any polygon

366
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,560
concave polygon

367
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:46,079
how many lines it doesn't matter when

368
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:48,320
you want to draw a convex product

369
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,320
that

370
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:49,399
you said it was is

371
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,720
concave yes

372
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,800
what's this

373
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,000
dot

374
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,360
let's count

375
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,160
okay

376
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:06,079
okay let's concave okay

377
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:08,880
any any other this is uh okay this is a

378
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:11,439
rectangle which is con

379
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,559
convex okay and this is concave if i

380
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,559
look i can always

381
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,280
yeah

382
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,880
mirror it and it'll be

383
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,039
convex

384
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,679
yeah

385
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:25,120
okay pac-man
