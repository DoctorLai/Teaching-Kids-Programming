1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
hello mr mr ryan ry

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,640
okay

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,559
so okay so we're going to talk about the

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,920
binary tree converting the binary to

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:14,400
undirectional graph okay so remember

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:17,039
all these are graphs

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,600
right but only the first one only the

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,840
first one is the

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,039
tree okay and it's specifically spinal

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,240
cheese

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,480
so the final trees first of all it's a

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,480
graph it's a subset of glass right and

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,160
it doesn't have these arrows okay it

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,360
doesn't have error it's an directional

15
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,079
graph okay

16
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,399
but

17
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,840
some people think it's a direction it's

18
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:42,079
dag why is that because the parents

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,320
from the trees we cannot from the if

20
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,120
we're given a root of tree under the

21
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,879
root of the tree we can only visit from

22
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,879
parents to kids yeah we can't go back

23
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,120
right if you're given two you don't know

24
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,120
where the parent is you only know it's

25
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,120
kids right so

26
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,399
sometimes we can think of trees as

27
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,239
directive directive directive

28
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,119
from parents to kids

29
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:07,360
and a cyclist yeah a cyclist

30
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:11,159
what does it mean exactly

31
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,159
what does this mean

32
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,439
[Music]

33
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,599
[Music]

34
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,439
so look this is not not a tree because

35
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,759
it has a graph oh yes a cycle right we

36
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,079
don't have a cycle in the tree at least

37
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,680
it's not because it's not connected

38
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,680
it's not connected right these two are

39
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:50,200
separate this is not connected these

40
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,200
this is kind of forest right foreign

41
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,520
this is not right if if we okay so this

42
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,840
is the directive graph yeah

43
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,880
undirectional undulation graph means

44
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,880
that

45
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,560
you know you just uh

46
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,560
it doesn't have errors errors

47
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,160
just like that right

48
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,160
so it means three completed four or four

49
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,000
can also visit three okay

50
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,920
all right so we are going to convert the

51
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,599
binary trees okay convert the final

52
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,720
trees

53
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:23,520
the final dream it means that a parent

54
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,520
can only have two maximum two maximum

55
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,400
two yeah if it doesn't have any kid it's

56
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,160
a leaf now we also we call it terminal

57
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,640
okay terminal

58
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,640
terminal

59
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,760
terminal now okay leave

60
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,720
this please

61
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,800
okay so um usually

62
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:46,160
how can we represent a tree

63
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,160
how can we represent a tree

64
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,400
class three yeah we cover three

65
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,800
and then well define

66
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:59,280
usually we define a

67
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,280
a tree using this kind of structure yeah

68
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,599
and the value and the left and right

69
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,280
right

70
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,360
okay

71
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,920
yeah so self

72
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,519
dot value equals value that means the

73
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,760
value of the note

74
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,440
the radial note and then it has two

75
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,200
two things pointing to the left and

76
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,840
right right

77
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,840
left

78
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,360
self

79
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,120
the right

80
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,120
equals okay so this is the three

81
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,959
definition one of the three definitions

82
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,799
in object oriented programming in python

83
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,040
right because we have three we have a

84
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,200
node we have value and we point to the

85
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,640
left and the points to the right okay

86
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,599
yeah make sense

87
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,319
yeah

88
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,599
and also some sometimes we can define

89
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,640
the tree

90
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:47,200
like we defined a graph which is what we

91
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,480
should for example like this one look

92
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,920
one two

93
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,200
three

94
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,480
four five so we can define it as the

95
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,519
list of

96
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,840
at least

97
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,959
from parents to the kid

98
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,799
a list of the edges right

99
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,159
we can define it as a list of edges so

100
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:08,159
what what what log 3 is defined look

101
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:11,680
it's one to two

102
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:14,720
okay a list of this yeah and then what

103
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,199
one two three

104
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,919
three two four

105
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:22,639
and three to five right you see

106
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,680
this is another way of defining a tree

107
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,479
right and

108
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,639
we can also use this to define a graph

109
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,960
right because the tree is a graph right

110
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,960
all right

111
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,600
okay so how do we define the graph

112
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,759
remember

113
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,520
define how do we represent the graph for

114
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,520
example like uh

115
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,840
you know how do we represent this in in

116
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,000
in a graph

117
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,000
okay how do we represent this in a block

118
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
one two three

119
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,160
any idea i mean we talked about this

120
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,110
before yeah how do we define

121
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,400
what did i just say

122
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:56,479
[Music]

123
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,120
if we're using this how do we define

124
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:01,199
we just list the number of edges

125
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,080
one two yeah

126
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,160
another one one three yeah if it's the

127
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,199
undirectional power

128
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,960
and then

129
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,120
two three okay

130
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,520
okay this is our direction if we hit the

131
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:17,840
direction then this we can also use this

132
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:20,160
to use the dimension here directly okay

133
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,400
and sometimes if there are

134
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,400
numbers over the edges we call it weight

135
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,800
right because for example if two from

136
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,960
two travel to three it costs like five

137
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,720
pounds yeah i put a five here five

138
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,880
pounds yeah something like that yeah if

139
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,120
it's one to two cost three pounds okay

140
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:38,160
so look three this is directional

141
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,720
weighted directional weighted edge

142
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,240
weighted edges weighted

143
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,600
directional weighted

144
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,479
graph okay

145
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,479
if a number if edge has the

146
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,880
numbers on it it means the weight

147
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:53,520
weighted weight and the one to three

148
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,600
yeah what about one to three i don't

149
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,479
know maybe it's three okay let's make

150
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,360
that so look we can use this there from

151
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:04,319
two and we possibly we can we can have a

152
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,479
another value called edge uh one two two

153
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:10,400
is three constraints sometimes something

154
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,400
like that right the list of edges

155
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:17,680
uh alternatively we can we can use uh we

156
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:21,199
can have this kind of data structure

157
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:23,199
which cause the adjacent list adjacent

158
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,039
adjacent list

159
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,240
okay what does that mean it means that

160
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,319
look at that

161
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,440
uh taking this for example yeah one to

162
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,000
two

163
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,039
two to three and maybe one two three

164
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,680
okay

165
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:38,080
so look the first

166
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,919
let's say the first graph okay the first

167
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,880
the first that we can use the dictionary

168
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:45,759
graph yeah dictionary okay this channel

169
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,840
g default dictionary yeah another the

170
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,199
key is the note the vertex yeah this is

171
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,599
converted

172
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,680
remember the vertex

173
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,840
vertex okay

174
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,639
vertex the graph is the collection of

175
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:01,680
vertex and edges okay so g equals a

176
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:04,400
connection of v and e okay so g

177
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,240
collection of v v is the key

178
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,280
key which is one

179
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,160
and then we can point to a list of if

180
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,599
the

181
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,039
vertex it points to in this case is two

182
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:18,319
and then

183
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:20,479
three right and

184
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,560
and then if two uh because we have a

185
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,639
weight only if this is uh

186
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,720
i'm waiting we can just do this a list

187
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,599
of vertex and if it's weighted then we

188
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:32,479
can put a couple yeah remember the top

189
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,280
two it points to the two the weight is

190
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,560
three

191
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,400
it points to the three it weighs as

192
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,199
three okay

193
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,880
okay so look the second

194
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,039
the second vertex

195
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,560
it points to three yeah it points to

196
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,919
three

197
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,680
it points to three the weight is five

198
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,759
okay and any other

199
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,039
vertex it points to it no right and then

200
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,560
vertical three

201
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,520
look at the vertex three points to

202
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,639
nothing right so we do this just empty

203
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,599
this

204
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,400
so this is the adjacent disk

205
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,720
okay

206
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,440
and we also can represent the graph

207
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,440
using the

208
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,960
adjacent metric so what does it mean

209
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,280
look

210
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:18,319
if if these are one two three okay let's

211
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,960
make it zero one three one two okay

212
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:24,080
and zero one two so we can just save

213
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:27,280
space on the magic so look

214
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,039
so we can do we cannot let metric yeah

215
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,960
so the rows

216
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,959
this is the rows

217
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:36,640
this is the columns

218
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:37,919
so for each node look this is g g if g i

219
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,880
j right

220
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:43,760
g i j means that the vertex i to vertex

221
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:46,000
j right this look and the weight only if

222
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,640
it's weighted so we can do this

223
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,080
g

224
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,920
zero to one is three so we put it zero

225
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,680
so let's just put it because look there

226
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,640
are three three notes so there will be

227
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,640
three three right

228
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,480
nine values

229
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,480
so what's the diagonal what's this

230
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,360
what does

231
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,880
what does it mean

232
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,040
it means gi what does it mean the

233
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,360
vertices i to vertical side right

234
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,760
yeah so usually it would be

235
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,839
the values that you know okay so the

236
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,320
value zero to zero so you'll be zero

237
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,600
right okay let's fill this zero to one

238
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,320
which is three

239
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,000
zero one so i put this into three change

240
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,160
this to three

241
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,800
okay and then zero to two

242
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:31,279
from zero to two is three so look

243
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,399
zero to two here i change it to two

244
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,399
right

245
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,800
okay and then

246
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,880
one to two is five

247
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,680
so one

248
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,360
yeah

249
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,279
two zero one two

250
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,600
is five

251
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:48,240
okay and one s see that to two is three

252
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,760
so where do i put it

253
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:54,000
where do i put the three zero to three

254
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,240
zero zero to two

255
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,800
zero

256
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,080
zero uh

257
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,640
okay okay wait wait wait that's a

258
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,920
mistake five five one

259
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,120
one to

260
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:10,160
one to two right one to two and

261
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,839
two uh three is zero to two zero to two

262
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,880
i put it already okay

263
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,480
i know

264
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:18,320
if but if one two two one two two then

265
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,800
what zero

266
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,560
so it start with zero okay one to two

267
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,640
yeah one to two yeah

268
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,839
so look zero one

269
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,399
yeah

270
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:31,399
zero one two five okay so that's three

271
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,399
values

272
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,720
yeah yeah because look at the metric the

273
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,160
the away the least in the computer style

274
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,079
is zero

275
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,160
zero to two is three yeah

276
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:45,279
zero

277
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,120
ah so okay zero one two okay generator

278
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,880
two is three yeah you're all right yeah

279
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,720
okay so what's three

280
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,079
zero two one is three okay so there's no

281
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,680
two here right because there are three

282
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,279
edges three three five okay so easy five

283
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,200
right now we're done yeah

284
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,600
you see adjacent magic this is how we

285
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,519
represent the graph using adjective

286
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,839
mention

287
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:07,120
okay so this is just the basic okay and

288
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,320
today task very simple

289
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,000
okay

290
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,240
so today we will give you a binary to

291
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,200
you especially but you can we can extend

292
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,480
this to

293
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,560
to n

294
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:20,000
to a general it doesn't have to be

295
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,920
binary it could be n three

296
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,720
how do you say the tree which has the

297
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:28,370
three maximum three notes

298
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:31,480
i think ten arrays we always

299
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:31,480
[Music]

300
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,959
maybe i don't know means three yeah

301
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:44,399
okay i don't know okay so look at the

302
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,399
balance tree okay one two three

303
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:50,880
four okay let's let's say this finally

304
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,320
yeah let's find the thing look

305
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,320
let's find energy

306
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,680
we want to convert it yeah we want to

307
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,399
convert it

308
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,600
to

309
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,160
a graph

310
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:03,920
like what the adjacent list for example

311
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:05,600
adjacent is right g equals the graph

312
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,560
okay additionally yeah this is called

313
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,560
using this and then you need to tell me

314
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:14,079
which is what

315
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:16,480
one the key the one points to

316
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:18,800
two and three okay

317
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,800
yeah

318
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,000
but again two

319
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,720
two points to one right because look

320
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,720
look look look

321
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,240
the graph that the tree only one point

322
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,399
is two by one graph is undirectional

323
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,560
okay so two means needs to point to one

324
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,959
again right yeah

325
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,959
so if you take these if you consider

326
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,959
this as a graph as a graph it's not a

327
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,680
tree look two is connected to one as i

328
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,920
like

329
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,600
okay so now three you tell me what

330
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,360
should i put here

331
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,320
three what should i put here

332
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,480
put it in the list what should i put uh

333
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,320
you should put

334
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,399
no way

335
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,000
how many how many vertex

336
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,410
does the three connect to

337
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,959
one

338
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:03,760
[Music]

339
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,720
yeah

340
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:09,519
okay but let's go into what's the

341
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,480
pokemon card yeah if i get it yeah

342
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,200
okay

343
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,200
and then four

344
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,560
four is

345
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,600
three

346
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,600
okay and then five

347
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,639
you see

348
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,959
so look we converted these to

349
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,880
undirectional graph because it yeah one

350
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,839
connected to three we also connected one

351
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,320
right

352
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,480
yeah and directional graph final three

353
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,519
final trick you can use this

354
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,959
uh the the thing we just said three each

355
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,279
three note

356
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,800
uh has the value

357
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:43,279
has a left

358
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,800
that's the right okay

359
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,920
okay

360
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,920
yeah

361
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,839
but before we do this

362
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,240
this is one kind of three structure and

363
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,839
how about an edges you know let's say we

364
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,480
have edges from

365
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:59,279
two edges this is edges

366
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,160
edges this is the added list of edges

367
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,360
yeah

368
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:05,760
list of edges from two from two

369
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,360
from two okay

370
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,920
yeah

371
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,920
okay so

372
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,720
that makes sense so do we how do we do

373
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,720
it remember

374
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,600
for this one it'll be simple yeah we'll

375
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,199
go through the list i know we can just

376
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,160
assign it right

377
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,680
yeah

378
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,199
but for this one

379
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,079
for this one what

380
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:30,399
it's not given the tree is not given by

381
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,399
edges it's given by the notes

382
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,680
by a lute note

383
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,000
right

384
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,320
right so so we need we can we need to

385
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,320
travel as a tree so what kind of

386
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,399
equilibrium in your mind can you know

387
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,519
can we use to travel

388
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:47,279
where down backwards

389
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,160
let's do this okay that will be easy

390
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,000
okay

391
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,680
i'm going to try i'm going to i'm going

392
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,320
i'm going to keep this okay this is the

393
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:57,360
graph this is the

394
00:14:54,320 --> 00:15:00,560
the adjacent matching adjacent

395
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,639
no adjacent list okay adjusting this

396
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,720
yeah because the keys are the vertex the

397
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,800
least is the list of the

398
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,839
vertex it connects to right

399
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,079
so

400
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,760
um

401
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:14,079
okay so let's let's let's write this

402
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,040
okay define

403
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,120
uh

404
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:20,000
let's say convert

405
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,320
a tree if like three is given uh edges

406
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,360
okay let's write this version first of

407
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,839
all we need to define this g equals

408
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:30,000
default additional yeah because because

409
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,920
by default is the dictionary

410
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,480
and then the default value this the

411
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,000
value is the what what what type of the

412
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:40,160
value is this

413
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,000
dictionary what's this

414
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,800
what's this

415
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,320
what's this what's it called

416
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,279
yeah but what's this what's type of

417
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,720
these

418
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,600
yeah at least

419
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,839
yeah

420
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,360
you see yeah if it's an integer we'll

421
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,040
put it in right if it's a string we'll

422
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,040
put a str right

423
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,279
and now it just goes through the digit

424
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,800
for

425
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:04,680
for

426
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:07,279
a the edge is given a to b a b in edges

427
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:09,839
[Music]

428
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,880
then i can say g

429
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,000
a

430
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,720
well

431
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,120
list of edges g a dot

432
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,639
append

433
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:23,839
b right

434
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:23,839
and can you write this g what a pen one

435
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,560
because a to b that means there's an

436
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,839
edge from b to there because we're

437
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,480
trying to

438
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:39,199
convert the trees into undirectional

439
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,680
graph okay yeah undirectional means both

440
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,279
ways both ways

441
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,519
yeah

442
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:47,839
uh so this is the

443
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:50,320
given list will be very similar we just

444
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:53,040
go through the list and how about if the

445
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,959
if we are given this as uh loot right

446
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,279
we're going to root

447
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:58,240
right and this we can't use this anymore

448
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,079
but

449
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,880
as we said different search processes

450
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,920
right

451
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,640
but

452
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,959
so look if i want to travel

453
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,720
like that okay

454
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:12,720
point for search what's the possible

455
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,720
search uh let's say here

456
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,880
what's the process search order for this

457
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,039
one

458
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,039
one

459
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,329
okay what's the preference search uh for

460
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,640
search

461
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:27,760
[Music]

462
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:30,480
if it's a pre-order

463
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:33,360
no no if it's one

464
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,960
if it's in order

465
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,740
it's one

466
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,200
two

467
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:42,640
[Music]

468
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:44,400
three four five six yeah oh is that uh

469
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,280
no no no at least it's not dinosaurs to

470
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,200
you because look oh yeah it's not but

471
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,360
but look if

472
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,840
we order what's pre-order

473
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,720
note left to right right we visit the no

474
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,480
first

475
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,000
and we visit the left and we'll visit

476
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,840
the right okay so

477
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,520
note so we visit the no first place one

478
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,559
okay one two

479
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,520
three

480
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:10,480
and this is the right why which is four

481
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:13,520
five six yeah note that that's us okay

482
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,760
okay so but we visit these so whenever

483
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,600
we reach the note we want to add an edge

484
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,559
from the kids to the parent what does it

485
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,160
mean

486
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:22,559
what does it mean

487
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:25,120
look we're traversing the tree but we

488
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:27,760
want to add a edge between the kids to

489
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,360
the parents so what does it mean do we

490
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,600
but we don't know the parent yeah but we

491
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,880
know where it comes from right yeah so

492
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,200
what does it mean the difference search

493
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,160
we need to pass down the parents right

494
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,919
yeah

495
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,799
define

496
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:43,200
that for such first of all

497
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:45,200
and i know the parent yes parents

498
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,039
what you're doing what you

499
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,200
you're busy

500
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,400
dude and parents

501
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,320
okay eric

502
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,520
why do we need a parent and what did i

503
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,280
just say

504
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:58,240
because um

505
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:00,320
because the parent

506
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,240
is

507
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,679
yeah why we need a parent in in

508
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:07,640
different states

509
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,640
because we stopped

510
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,919
yeah and then we will go down we want to

511
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,000
add the edge from parent to current

512
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,919
right yeah that's right okay

513
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
okay it's not good

514
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,600
if we originally empty air we just

515
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,760
returned right

516
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,679
okay

517
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,440
and then if apparently if they ask

518
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,840
parents if we have parents because we

519
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,840
have to check why is that because

520
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,760
because a parent could be

521
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:35,280
numb in what cases the parent would be

522
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,280
nothing it would be enough

523
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,919
right the loot

524
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,919
the route doesn't have parents right

525
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,679
yeah yeah if

526
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,799
if parents if there's parent then we can

527
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,000
just say

528
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:50,400
g

529
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,400
parent

530
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,640
not a pen and you can write this as a

531
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,000
plus equal okay this is the same thing

532
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,160
dude all right

533
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,200
okay can you tell me what's next g what

534
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,200
plus e for one

535
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,320
okay

536
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:08,159
i'm adding a h from parent to the root

537
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,960
and what's next

538
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:12,559
anyway come on you're listening if i add

539
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,520
edges from parent to the load what does

540
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,520
it mean do i

541
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,039
um do i need to add the edges what

542
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:28,480
i have already added from parent to root

543
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,480
so what do i need to add next

544
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:31,680
[Music]

545
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,919
okay i already add the edge from one to

546
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,080
two

547
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:40,799
so what should i do next

548
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,799
what's your ad

549
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,799
okay so what the other part is

550
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:49,039
[Music]

551
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,039
there's

552
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,480
yeah it's easier

553
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,159
and now we just have to travel the black

554
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,039
tree and right three right so can you

555
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,080
tell me

556
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,080
dfs one

557
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:13,600
left what's the parent of rudolph come

558
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:14,320
on i asked you the question before yes

559
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,440
and

560
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,440
another one dms

561
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,960
and then what's the parent

562
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:29,840
and then we just call the beginning

563
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,840
dfs loot what's the parent upload

564
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,679
beautifully yeah we traverse on a tree

565
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:41,919
in different manner recursions

566
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,880
and but we need to pass down the parents

567
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,520
right

568
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,200
because because we need to add edge from

569
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,200
a parent to the root if the parent if

570
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,200
there's a parent yeah in the special

571
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,520
case is the root doesn't have a parent

572
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,240
so we pass with none if personal number

573
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,480
say the parent is numb and then

574
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,880
it doesn't add an edge here

575
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,520
okay so there's a problem

576
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:06,799
why is that look i need to

577
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:09,280
i need to put it here right because look

578
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:13,360
even apparently if the root if there's a

579
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:13,360
rule lou still needs to add

580
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,600
do i need to add that look

581
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,440
i passed the

582
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,480
pass download

583
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,559
okay g root um

584
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,080
root adding the

585
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:28,960
kit

586
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:31,280
no no no okay wait wait wait

587
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,840
d pattern if parent and parent has the

588
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:36,320
to the lord okay and then the loot dude

589
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,440
needs to add the parent no uh

590
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,720
maybe not

591
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,240
that's okay because

592
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,400
in this case apparently it's nothing

593
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,320
yeah do you add

594
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,000
you don't add the edge right so that's

595
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:49,520
right yeah because the

596
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,760
if it's the root you only add the edge

597
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,919
you only go down to the kids to other

598
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,400
edge right so you come to the left and

599
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:58,720
you add edge from two to the one or one

600
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,400
one to the two okay if apparently it's

601
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,159
nothing then we don't

602
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:06,159
execute so this is correct this is

603
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,159
correct that's the default search

604
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,720
and the preference search and what kind

605
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,559
of

606
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,840
how do we implement a processor do we

607
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:14,000
still remember what kind of data

608
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:17,120
structure are we used uh are we using to

609
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,120
implement a breakfast search

610
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,840
what's cue

611
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:23,679
[Music]

612
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,120
first thing

613
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,480
first thing what up

614
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,280
first thing first of all yeah it's like

615
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,039
a queue right you you you you wait in

616
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:34,240
the queue right first come first serve

617
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:36,799
yeah first first thing first one okay

618
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:39,039
in python we use the

619
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:40,400
how do we implement how do we declare a

620
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:43,600
queue

621
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,600
how do we take care of you

622
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,120
what and i need to put a

623
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,039
loop

624
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:52,320
yeah yeah loot an apparent

625
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:53,279
the parent is numb right

626
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,440
uh

627
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:57,440
the first parameter is the note the

628
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,039
second parameter is the

629
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,799
the second

630
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:03,120
value in the coupler yeah we're using

631
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:05,360
the parentheses is the tuple is the

632
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,279
parent it's parents and the dq dq means

633
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,320
double ndq

634
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:12,640
then wire q okay

635
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,880
so now we take an element out so we take

636
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,880
the carbon

637
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,760
we take the current and then we take the

638
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:22,320
parent and then that will be the same

639
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:25,039
yeah q how do we get the element how do

640
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:27,279
we get the elements on the queue how do

641
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:29,679
we take it out

642
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:31,200
dq how do we take it out take it take an

643
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:34,000
element of the

644
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:37,039
left where down top from the left hand

645
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,520
left hand side yeah if the stack is the

646
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:41,039
the other side it pops right

647
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,039
yeah remember the step first thing

648
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:45,279
that's alright you put this in and you

649
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:49,200
take it out on one side

650
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:51,760
but q q is different yeah you dq you

651
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,720
enqueue it means putting an element into

652
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,559
the cube

653
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,320
on one side and you take it out from the

654
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,440
other side this is pop left this is

655
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,360
apparent

656
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,799
right why we're using the

657
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,279
dq

658
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:05,600
if we put it on the left side we

659
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:07,360
if we probably then on the other side we

660
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:11,120
this is a pen left

661
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,120
right and then this is the

662
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:15,919
append left top left

663
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,480
a pen

664
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:21,360
and then this is what pop okay

665
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:23,520
double ndq means two ways you can do it

666
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,520
so the way one advantage of using double

667
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,520
ndq is that the

668
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,440
the operation these four operations are

669
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:32,000
all constant time right it's not like at

670
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:35,039
least in python look impressive if you

671
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,120
declare a kill using this simple list

672
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:39,840
right you can stop pop

673
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:43,279
zero remember but prob zero

674
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,240
is ninten it's called ninja time right

675
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,760
all right

676
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:49,120
make sense

677
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,120
yeah what did i just say

678
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,039
okay so now we're getting the element

679
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,880
from the queue

680
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:59,120
and then again this is the samurai it's

681
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,640
parent you kind of what should we do

682
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,760
apparent

683
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,000
g

684
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,039
parent

685
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,159
a pen

686
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,640
