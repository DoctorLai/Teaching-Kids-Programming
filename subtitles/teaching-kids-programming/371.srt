1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,000
up

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:06,799
hello mr harry mr ryan all right

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,559
yeah okay so this number

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,960
christmas one two three four five is

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,559
this divisible by three

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:17,400
uh

7
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:17,400
yeah why is that because although

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:35,280
how do you know this this one 1 plus 2

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,280
plus 3 plus 4 plus 5 equals 0. last time

10
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,000
okay so today yeah so any numbers yeah

11
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,079
any numbers i don't know just make up

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,840
some numbers

13
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,160
the integer yeah it can be only you

14
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,120
could be divided by three only and if

15
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,399
only

16
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,120
all the digits

17
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,039
sum up the sum would also be divided by

18
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,360
three yeah like 21

19
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,960
2 plus one three let's divide by three

20
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,680
okay yeah

21
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,000
the the integer

22
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,240
so how that top number that's being

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,240
circled is in the eight times so look

24
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,760
look at this one two plus three plus

25
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:14,000
four plus seven plus eight equals 28 28

26
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,640
is it by three no

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,080
is it uh

28
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,240
i mean 24 24 yeah divided by two yes so

29
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,040
this number can be divided by three okay

30
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:28,240
make sense three of these can be okay

31
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,079
okay so today we're going to prove this

32
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,200
it'll be easy okay so let's say how can

33
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,000
we prove this

34
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,920
like a number yeah a number like like

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,560
one two three four five okay

36
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,119
one two three four five this number i

37
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,479
really like look

38
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,360
one is

39
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:48,479
in what in one

40
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,159
ten thousand right so it's one times ten

41
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,320
thousand

42
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,880
okay how many zero yeah

43
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,479
two is two

44
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,719
two times

45
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,240
what one

46
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,119
thousand right

47
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,320
yeah

48
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,520
three

49
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:08,720
is three times a hundred

50
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,160
five and four is four times ten five is

51
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,920
five times

52
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,879
one right this is ten to the power of

53
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,560
zero

54
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,920
okay

55
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,599
okay

56
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,640
yeah this number

57
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,319
twelve

58
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,720
thousand and three hundred forty five is

59
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:26,239
this added together am i right

60
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,239
yeah yeah okay so this

61
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,080
one times ten thousand

62
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,280
yeah how about

63
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,360
is it equal

64
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,599
it equals to one

65
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,440
times

66
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,959
ten thousand

67
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,040
minus one

68
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,040
yeah i need to plus one right

69
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,200
this equals two times

70
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,840
a thousand minus one and i need to five

71
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,080
[Music]

72
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,920
look there are a hundred thousand twos

73
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,319
now i times

74
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,840
one less so i need to plus one two yeah

75
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:06,159
exactly these equals three times

76
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:09,519
uh a hundred minus one plus three okay

77
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:13,360
and these are four times a hundred minus

78
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:15,760
ten minus one plus four and then is

79
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,879
four five times

80
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,319
one

81
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:22,239
one minus one for us

82
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,800
13 notice this

83
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,800
what's this

84
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,680
9999

85
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,640
what's this

86
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,799
999 what's this

87
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,799
99 what's this

88
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,840
9 what's this 0

89
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,879
yeah

90
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,200
it's not

91
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:45,680
9999 is it divided by 3 obviously yeah

92
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,159
yeah so the multiple always divided by c

93
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,640
so this divided by three this divided by

94
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,680
three please divided by this divided by

95
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,239
okay

96
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,560
so i have a number yeah

97
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,439
all right i have number

98
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,879
n

99
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:04,640
this is equals a plus b right

100
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:07,200
a is less this left side

101
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,519
is least divided by three

102
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,680
yes why because these are

103
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,400
multiple three right yeah

104
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,560
okay so this divided by three so

105
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,400
this in order to be divided by three so

106
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,280
this p needs to be divided by three

107
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,880
right what's b

108
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,080
b needs to be

109
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,479
what's b

110
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,040
plus one and the plus two and the plus

111
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:31,120
three and four and the plus five so

112
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,560
let's what's this what's this beef it's

113
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,759
a bitch

114
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,800
times the

115
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:39,440
thing no no no no no look these this one

116
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,040
this one two three four five equals

117
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,400
this whole thing right

118
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,800
yeah

119
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,199
this left bit we proved it's divided by

120
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:51,120
three the p is one plus two plus three

121
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:52,479
plus one five is the sum of the digit

122
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,070
right

123
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,400
yeah

124
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:57,280
[Music]

125
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,199
so this question becomes that if we can

126
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,360
prove that the sum of digits divides by

127
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,120
three then this whole number is divided

128
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,800
by three am i right yeah that's what you

129
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,199
said at the beginning

130
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,680
yeah that's how we approve it

131
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,199
makes sense

132
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,400
yeah

133
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:17,440
ryan do you get it

134
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,680
yeah okay so let's see we have a number

135
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,840
yeah let's look in python you can say

136
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:26,160
defined divided by three divided by

137
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:28,639
three okay and n and it's a

138
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,240
string okay str yeah we can convert it

139
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,720
to in

140
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,080
into f n and then we can say divided by

141
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,960
sigma x

142
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,080
but

143
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,720
to uh to demonstrate these process let's

144
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,080
edit up the digit okay everywhere let's

145
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,240
end it update it

146
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,440
so we can do what the digit sum would be

147
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,039
s equals zero then we can say f o for i

148
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:53,520
in n yeah

149
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:56,400
s plus equals converted each bit to

150
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,880
to integer and then we just can return

151
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,720
if s divided by so you have

152
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,199
e equals zero okay

153
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,680
yeah go through each digit divided by

154
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:08,720
three okay yeah

155
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:11,520
is another easy way will be some

156
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:15,199
retain sum of what

157
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,240
we want to convert each one to it in to

158
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,800
i

159
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,800
for i

160
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:24,000
in list

161
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,120
n all right if this divided by three

162
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,080
equals zero

163
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:31,280
what does it mean look this n if

164
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,400
this if n is one two three because

165
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,280
the

166
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,160
the string list n will become

167
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,440
one

168
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,960
two

169
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,199
three okay

170
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,000
and then i go through this i and then

171
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:46,000
convert it to each each digit to integer

172
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,280
and then i sum it up and divided by

173
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,960
three equals zero yeah makes sense

174
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,520
yeah so what have you learned today so

175
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,280
far about how to divide by three

176
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:59,280
and how do we prove it

177
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:02,880
okay so it's one times uh a hundred and

178
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:05,199
i mean ten thousand like if it's one two

179
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,080
three four five

180
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,639
yeah

181
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,360
it's the same as one times

182
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,199
ten thousand

183
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,720
no one times of

184
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,440
ten thousand

185
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:21,360
minus one which is nine nine nine nine

186
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:23,120
plus one and nine nine nine nine is the

187
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,160
can divided by three

188
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,319
so we are actually looking these yeah so

189
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,160
any digit oh one two three yeah it

190
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,759
actually can be represented as a

191
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,199
multiple of

192
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,319
of these 999 you know in the in the form

193
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,400
of nines

194
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:41,039
right in the form of nice plus excel

195
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:45,120
right three three in the hundreds three

196
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:47,199
hundred is equals three times 99 plus 3

197
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,120
4 40 equals

198
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,960
4 times 9

199
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:55,360
plus 4 yeah

200
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:58,080
yeah 2 2 000 equals 2 times 99 plus 2

201
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,639
okay so all the left bits are divided by

202
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,440
three so that quick the

203
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,520
let's the value is actually equals the b

204
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,000
this bit yeah uh

205
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,720
the sum of the digits yeah

206
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,199
n equals a plus b a can be divided by

207
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,440
three so we are we just need to prove

208
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,680
that b can also be uh

209
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,479
divided by three all right make sense

210
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,879
yeah

211
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:23,680
and somehow by digit yeah we convert

212
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:26,400
each digit the string to integer yeah or

213
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,000
we can use the one one line sum in i for

214
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,639
i in this end

215
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,360
list n make it array

216
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,320
in i for i in this array convert each

217
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,039
digit

218
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:40,080
to a value and then we sum it using this

219
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,760
sum actually this sum is a lot faster if

220
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,200
we can sum it because this is

221
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,800
implemented in

222
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:49,040
c plus plus okay it's it's better expect

223
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,040
is quicker than this

224
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,440
for loop yeah if we call in this sum

225
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:57,399
function that will be a lot faster okay

226
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,399
okay that's it for today bye-bye
