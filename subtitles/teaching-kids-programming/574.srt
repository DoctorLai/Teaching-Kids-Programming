1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:07,440
hello Mr Mr Reiner right yeah okay so

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:12,420
let's say we have 10 persons from one to

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:14,639
n right so one two three four up to n

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,980
and at the beginning the first person

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:20,039
has the pillow pillow here

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:22,260
and it takes one second to pass the

7
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,760
period from one person to another to the

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,380
neighbor right so at the beginning the

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,779
first person passed the pillows to

10
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:29,460
second person and in another second the

11
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:32,460
second person passed the period to the

12
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,440
third person and when the pillar reaches

13
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,920
when the pillar reaches the nth person

14
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:40,320
and the next time you pass it back so

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,239
after 30 seconds we want to know where

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:47,579
the appear is let's take the example and

17
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,579
the three percent right so daddy Ryan

18
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:56,579
after four seconds who has the period

19
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:59,300
after four seconds four seconds

20
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:59,300
second seconds

21
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,440
the third second pass it back

22
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,360
the fourth second

23
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,680
okay after four seconds ready has it

24
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,900
right

25
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,740
and then the fifth second sixth second

26
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:17,880
seven a nine ten eleven and this is the

27
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:21,000
parameter of N and T we want to find out

28
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:23,040
who has an appearance at the end the N

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,439
antique arbitrary like T could be a

30
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,520
Minion Okay this is nothing p p could be

31
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,680
a minion

32
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:32,159
if you didn't know that that many

33
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,140
persons life is that if you want to do a

34
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:38,400
million seconds under a million persons

35
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:41,100
it's a it's the second last person yes

36
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,920
okay but nnt could be arbitrary that's

37
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:46,619
the thing so how do we find out easily I

38
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,860
mean obviously we can what did Daddy

39
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:52,860
just do we can simulate right we can

40
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,840
simulate the process but this is not

41
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,479
very efficient because tea is a medium

42
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,399
and it takes many all iteration that's

43
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:03,680
very slow right

44
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:03,680
so any better ways to do it

45
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,959
take it all around the back okay I know

46
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:16,280
what was that if there are three person

47
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:19,620
how many seconds to go back to four yeah

48
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:21,599
one two three four yes if they are

49
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:24,360
another one money yeah how many seconds

50
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:27,239
four percent how many seconds

51
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:31,620
one two three four five six okay so and

52
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:34,200
how many seconds to take a long trip and

53
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,540
two okay and times two minus two okay

54
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,120
this is the same thing as n minus one

55
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:41,099
times two right n times two minus two

56
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,519
okay okay so we know

57
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:46,980
the amount of seconds it takes to do a

58
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:49,319
long trip and then we are given T

59
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:51,540
seconds so what can we do about it so do

60
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:55,379
we need to you know do these uh long

61
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:57,840
trips no right because after a long trip

62
00:02:55,379 --> 00:03:00,239
it doesn't change right all right so

63
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,480
what do we do with this tea goodbye

64
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,480
goodbye

65
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,540
divided it's modulus right we want

66
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:13,319
together yeah yeah because we want to

67
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:16,220
reduce this big number if like you get

68
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:16,220
the integer and

69
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:23,280
and they've easily just put it but if

70
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:26,400
it's odd number then you're still on the

71
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,019
way back X modulus 39 how many

72
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,360
possibilities

73
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:34,620
what's the possible values

74
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:37,620
0 to 38 39 various right so any number

75
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,000
three modulus this one is this number of

76
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,459
hospitalities all right so we're

77
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,940
reducing the T to end right make sense

78
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:50,940
so after that okay so let's say

79
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:53,879
t modules n minus one times two

80
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:57,299
this is K okay suppose we have this

81
00:03:53,879 --> 00:04:00,540
number K this is first person after the

82
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:03,239
wrong tricks they are K remains so how

83
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:06,480
many possibilities

84
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:09,360
do for now persons yeah I know it could

85
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,099
be this way or it could be this way all

86
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,900
the way back yeah yeah it could be yeah

87
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:14,159
it could be here or it could be on the

88
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:17,519
way back right so there are two

89
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:22,620
possibilities Ela is here all the way

90
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:26,280
back this bit is equals to n times two

91
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:30,120
minus K so we just have to get a minimum

92
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:32,580
right it could be this way or leave

93
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:35,100
whichever is minimum for example like

94
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:37,400
five percent right one two three four

95
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:41,340
five five percent k equals four

96
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:44,340
obviously it's this one right k equals a

97
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:47,699
k equals four this year

98
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:50,780
k equals a which person is it yeah but

99
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:54,180
if k equals four then you'll be five

100
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:55,500
because yeah okay that's a plus one yes

101
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,180
it does

102
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,780
it has a five week subtract two because

103
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,780
because

104
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:10,560
okay so k equals these plus one okay A

105
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:13,500
plus one here because when the remaining

106
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,600
is a star from zero right remain is zero

107
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:18,060
I plus one to make it the first person

108
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,300
so let's say k equals four so obviously

109
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:24,000
the fourth person k equals a one two

110
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:27,020
three four five six seven eight is here

111
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,020
all right

112
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:36,060
how do we get these two from eight

113
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:39,419
is five times two minus

114
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:42,840
a okay what it means is that we want to

115
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:45,720
find out if it's closer to this side

116
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:48,180
yeah to the left because if it's closer

117
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:51,180
to the left this K is closer to the left

118
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:53,639
then it's the speed it is on the way to

119
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:56,520
to the to the right if it's a closer to

120
00:05:53,639 --> 00:06:00,060
the left the round trip right this K is

121
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:02,460
bigger than this portion is closer to

122
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,919
the left all right yes okay so the

123
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:07,020
answer will be just there the minimum of

124
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:10,139
these two but what if it's like going

125
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:12,419
back this is the way to go back go back

126
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:13,919
is this bit go back is this bit we want

127
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:16,919
to calculate this bit right to the left

128
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:19,199
uh yeah we actually want to find out who

129
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:23,580
owns the pillow actually is the the left

130
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:27,840
bit right is this bit or this bit

131
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:30,780
huh well let's say there's like four

132
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:33,919
people and the Seven seconds

133
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:40,139
four people in seven seconds yeah

134
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:42,720
one two three four five six seven yeah

135
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:45,960
uh-huh I mean like how would you work it

136
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,419
out and nothing like okay

137
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:51,300
four percent n equals four how many

138
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:54,319
seconds to travel around is

139
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:57,900
total T is eight

140
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:59,460
minus six six right six and then you say

141
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:03,720
seven seconds right yeah

142
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:05,940
seven multiples six is

143
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:09,240
one right yeah

144
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:11,220
one and one needs to pass one because uh

145
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:15,000
plus one to make it two

146
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:17,940
okay yeah so two so we want to find out

147
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,280
two left four percent four times two

148
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:23,580
minus minus two

149
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:25,919
two and six which is smaller is two so

150
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:29,340
it's the second person okay

151
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:33,240
okay do you understand why we need to do

152
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:36,840
the minimum of K and N times two minus K

153
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:40,620
okay so let me repeat okay is it is

154
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:43,979
there any situation that it will be the

155
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:45,840
right side by n times T minus K let's do

156
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:49,740
this the example again like let's say

157
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,840
how many seconds let's say 10 yeah eight

158
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:53,940
nine ten right ten okay that's a good

159
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:57,180
example ten so this speed is the same

160
00:07:53,940 --> 00:08:01,039
right so uh which is that t equals six n

161
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:06,120
equals four n equals four T equals six

162
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:08,220
the small T equals ten right ten modulus

163
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,560
6 is

164
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:12,300
4. we need to plus one right we want to

165
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,900
find out five and

166
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:18,060
minus 2 and N times two a minus five

167
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:20,940
three okay

168
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:22,979
so five and three plus three seven eight

169
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:24,660
nine ten so sweet this is on the way

170
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:27,599
back this speed

171
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:31,020
this bit or

172
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:34,260
or listed whichever is smaller this is K

173
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:36,419
and this speed is n times two minus K if

174
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:39,180
this n minus two is K is smaller than

175
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:41,640
this k then it's on the way back

176
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:46,080
otherwise it's on the way to the right

177
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:49,019
yes Define f and T

178
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,660
so total round of T equals n minus one

179
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:54,420
times two and T

180
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:57,120
T modulus

181
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:59,339
equal T and then we need the t plus

182
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,500
equal one right modular give the value

183
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:05,220
start from zero we need plus one to make

184
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:11,180
it the person right anonymity so we just

185
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:11,180
return minimum of t and n times two

186
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,120
do we use any addition of one yes

187
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,260
arbitrary and then T we can just

188
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,140
calculate it

189
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:28,260
almost immediately right another one to

190
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:31,320
solve it if n and T is smaller

191
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:33,480
okay so let's say x equals at the

192
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:39,720
beginning t

193
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:44,300
four underscore in range t t equals one

194
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:49,800
okay and then X plus equals d

195
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:54,180
if x equal equal 1 or x equal equal n

196
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:58,080
D times equal minus one return

197
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:58,920
x x equals one t equals one range T

198
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,339
times

199
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:05,459
X Plus equal D if x equals one or x

200
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:09,200
equals n then T times minus one okay so

201
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:09,200
return x what does it do

202
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:18,300
so yeah this simulation right pull on

203
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:20,700
the pillow after T second okay the next

204
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:23,580
two is key second time for each second X

205
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:25,980
pass equals d p is the how much times t

206
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:27,480
t equals one and then times equals minus

207
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:29,580
one will be minus one and then times

208
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,399
minus one will be one minus one one

209
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:35,100
minus one what's this thing yeah it's

210
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:38,220
like which way is going like it is that

211
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:40,560
yeah which way so X plus d if D is one

212
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:43,380
if T is one it's going right if TV was

213
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,880
minus one coming left right so when do

214
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,920
we change the D

215
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,959
well we change the B

216
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,640
when the partition is at the first

217
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:53,100
person or the last person will change

218
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,620
the direction and then after T re round

219
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:57,540
and X is the person who holds the

220
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:01,320
periods right what's the time come next

221
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:03,240
before this one o t o t yes we are

222
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,339
talking about the complexity yeah it

223
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,019
means T iterated okay let's face some

224
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:10,620
Legacy

225
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:14,100
oh any additional space constant space

226
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:16,079
only right oh what yeah okay OT do you

227
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,540
understand this Ultimo yeah yes that

228
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:20,720
simulation that's a mess so which one is

229
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,720
better

230
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:24,180
one okay left one okay this is the

231
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:27,000
exception and today I talk about the

232
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:29,880
Ultima at the beginning and this is to

233
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,440
give you an example okay

234
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,420
so

235
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,940
so why this is better than this one

236
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:39,240
because I won

237
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:41,940
the computer just do this simulation it

238
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:44,160
takes time right if T is very big like a

239
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:47,820
minion then this takes a million

240
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,959
iterations to n right OT right yeah but

241
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:52,500
this one

242
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:57,180
if T is a minion it doesn't matter look

243
00:11:52,500 --> 00:12:00,600
the second line T modulus please you

244
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:01,579
immediately you'll become smaller value

245
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,840
okay

246
00:12:01,579 --> 00:12:06,300
what have you learned today that's it

247
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:09,839
[Music]

248
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:12,079
yeah people think yeah so what's uh what

249
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,700
have you learned I mean what what

250
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,860
solution here can you tell me the

251
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:19,380
problem

252
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:23,470
and solution and that's it

253
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:25,440
uh so the problem is we have the

254
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:27,540
[Music]

255
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,519
have to have another second with his

256
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:31,279
teeth and

257
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:37,320
and so

258
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:39,540
so we end every second the person path

259
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:43,019
to the next person and to the next

260
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:46,700
person and at the end of the line the

261
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:50,040
last person I'll pass it back

262
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:53,820
and we want to find out what person

263
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:56,639
doesn't end after finishing 30 seconds

264
00:12:53,820 --> 00:13:00,060
so we have a left one which is basically

265
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:03,180
like math you just find out the the N

266
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:05,639
minus one times two and then we just

267
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:07,920
moderate it and then give a remainder

268
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:10,079
and then you you have to remember to

269
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:13,320
plus one because when the first person

270
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:15,720
passes pass it on the first second this

271
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:18,779
is on the second person and you don't

272
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,820
count the first person because nobody is

273
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:23,579
passing through the first person on the

274
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:28,040
first time why are this is minimum of

275
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:31,200
tea and a minus two because because

276
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:34,279
uh it might have a remainder which is

277
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,279
which is larger

278
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:41,339
to go back yeah go back this go back and

279
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:43,380
we have to check which way is there but

280
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:46,019
is it on the way or is it on the way

281
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:48,139
back okay okay that's it for today bye

282
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:48,139
bye bye

283
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,079
foreign
