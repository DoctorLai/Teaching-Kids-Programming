1
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,240
so it's a package so usually we say from

2
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,640
by set

3
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:26,960
we can import two functions

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,960
import two function which is bisect left

5
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,160
and bisect right okay we're going to

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:35,440
talk about this today

7
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:39,280
by set finally finally search finally

8
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:41,360
yeah remember if we have a

9
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,559
if we have a sorted array right

10
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:47,680
certainly one two three four five

11
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:50,879
however if it's the salty

12
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:54,239
if it if this array at least is sorted

13
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,039
we can find uh element which is pick uh

14
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,960
you know

15
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,600
if it's in in array which is pretty fast

16
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,320
right yeah and the time complexity if

17
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,760
that n element is oh

18
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,080
you should know this if there are n

19
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,680
low levels

20
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,320
because every time we can do this final

21
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,600
research yeah half yeah but if it's not

22
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,920
salted

23
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,640
if it's not salted we need

24
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,680
oh and lock the end to sort it yeah this

25
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,000
is sorting

26
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,600
and if we do this linear swatch

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,439
like if we are performing the search

28
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,680
checking india

29
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,520
if we're doing this linear search

30
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,200
from the beginning to the end yeah one

31
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,159
two three and the time complexity will

32
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,799
be what in the worst case if we're going

33
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:39,200
to each element one by one what's the

34
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,000
time complexity anyone

35
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,640
you know oh what the worst case this is

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,640
super easy

37
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,560
oh and yeah because in the worst case

38
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,320
it's you need to check an element okay

39
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,960
that's pretty big spacey

40
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,640
so bicep okay so if i have a

41
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,159
if i have a

42
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:04,399
array sorted array like one two two

43
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:06,399
three three three four five okay

44
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,959
so bisect left and backs and right

45
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,160
returns the the

46
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,120
instruction

47
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,959
position okay so isaac left it one two

48
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,680
two and okay

49
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:21,920
four five five if look if it binds left

50
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,480
the first if this is array the first one

51
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,720
the first parameter is the

52
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,200
the list so we give list and the second

53
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,720
parameter is the number the x

54
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:35,360
the x yeah so you can say x equals

55
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,599
let's say three

56
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,160
so you will return a position

57
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:42,959
right so you you will return here

58
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,920
uh here right

59
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,760
so you will return a partition in this

60
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,760
insertion point you will return the

61
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,239
insertion point

62
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,319
what's insertion

63
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,920
insertion point i

64
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,080
right so

65
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,280
a up to i

66
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,319
for e

67
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,480
in

68
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,680
so any elements in up to i element i is

69
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,519
all

70
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,000
smaller

71
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,239
smaller than

72
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,080
never than x uh

73
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,040
smaller than x

74
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,720
right so i i insert

75
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,560
so the insertion point will be here

76
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,080
because all the elements up to these

77
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,360
three look look

78
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,040
here it's all smaller than three right

79
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,959
and all the

80
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,319
all the elements at

81
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:34,959
i from index i afterwards is all bigger

82
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,959
or equal

83
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,599
x okay

84
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,280
and then the opposite the opposite bicep

85
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,920
right

86
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,599
bicep right

87
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,680
a3 okay so

88
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,680
it's different it will be returning the

89
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,560
insertion point here

90
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,920
right

91
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,360
right

92
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,519
all right

93
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,840
so what does it mean here it's quite

94
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:01,280
similar except that

95
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:05,439
a i

96
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:07,920
e in a i and e is smaller or equal x

97
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:10,000
right or this is smaller equal x because

98
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,360
i pass 3 here so all these are smaller

99
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,799
or equal to x

100
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,479
and all the elements start from i

101
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,519
is bigger than x

102
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:18,639
okay

103
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,079
make sense

104
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,079
so let's

105
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,639
do this and i'm going to test it give

106
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,040
you a small test

107
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,040
yeah

108
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,600
so and every element up to this

109
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,520
insertion point will be smaller what

110
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,840
question are you gonna give

111
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,280
i'm going to give another another one so

112
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,520
or maybe this one and i'm going to

113
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,199
change this to two so you tell me what's

114
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,800
the insertion of the left and what's the

115
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,680
interesting i don't understand what's

116
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,960
going

117
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,600
on

118
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,600
i'm just explaining here so bison that

119
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,680
returns insertion point so we're going

120
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,720
to put the element three in this sorted

121
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,400
array

122
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,520
to the left

123
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,600
so

124
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,840
so if i have a three here right

125
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,960
and i put it here so to all the elements

126
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:11,759
so the new three will be here right

127
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,160
there's already three i know but okay so

128
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,560
i can put that yeah but why is it there

129
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,919
why is that what do you mean

130
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,360
so this is the new insertion point

131
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,560
you don't get it

132
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,479
then why does definitely go down

133
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,840
that that would be returning that's what

134
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,759
i'm saying that would return the

135
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,800
insertion point i

136
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,080
where to put the element x this is x x

137
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,240
equals three

138
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,560
so you need to put it here right because

139
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,560
all the elements up before after this

140
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,919
point are smaller than the x right

141
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,600
because all the other they need to be

142
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,400
bigger

143
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,720
yeah

144
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,840
but this right is slightly different is

145
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,080
that you need

146
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,199
the insertion point left the same but

147
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:56,080
it's at the right yeah okay so let's

148
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,039
just say but just at the right

149
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,800
side

150
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,960
yeah yeah yeah most likely so because

151
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,960
this is smaller or equal x and this is

152
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,000
smaller than an x right because i happen

153
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,240
to three

154
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,919
in all the left to the left everything

155
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,360
to the left of the insertion point needs

156
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:13,199
to be strictly smaller but bisect right

157
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,680
it's all the elements on the left hand

158
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,800
side yeah this this one yeah look

159
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,440
it's smaller or equal too right got it

160
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,120
okay so if i have two here bisect left

161
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,520
two where's where do you think you're

162
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,680
going to be

163
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,919
can you point to me

164
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,759
here or here come on let's buy set left

165
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,680
two if it's two

166
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,919
where

167
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:39,440
yeah this one too and if it's bisected

168
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,440
right two what where is it going to be

169
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,160
here

170
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:48,680
right because all the elements need to

171
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,680
yeah it's the same as three okay

172
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,960
you know we can implement this using

173
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,720
linear search look look for yeah look so

174
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,880
how can we implement this let's let's

175
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,199
implement bicep left using the linear

176
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,199
search

177
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,400
okay

178
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,960
let's just just quickly write it define

179
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,000
bisect

180
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,720
left

181
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,960
sometimes biset is equals to by the left

182
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,960
okay

183
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,479
a

184
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,360
x okay

185
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,599
i need

186
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,240
by default it has two parameters by

187
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,479
default x equal uh it has the lower

188
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,800
index equals zero right by default

189
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:41,199
default parameter and the high equals

190
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,520
none if high is none then

191
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,720
then high is the length of the

192
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,960
a

193
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,960
yeah so we can just do this for

194
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:55,759
power for i in range

195
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,960
length a

196
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,479
right

197
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,440
then we can say if a i

198
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:05,680
i

199
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:08,000
if a i a i is the right book if a i is

200
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:12,000
look on the bicep left is strictly

201
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:15,840
smaller than x right so if i a i

202
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,639
okay one two two three three three four

203
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,840
five

204
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,520
so if i said left two by the left

205
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:25,759
three you give me

206
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:28,560
here right so if this element is is what

207
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:30,560
bison left

208
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,200
okay i'm i'm ready to

209
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,200
so look bison left yeah question left

210
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,959
he's here bison right

211
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,320
three

212
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:44,080
is here right

213
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:46,720
so the left if if 3 is bigger

214
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:50,399
it's bigger or equal right it's bigger

215
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,399
it should be bigger or equal right

216
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,839
x then we return i am right

217
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,680
make sense

218
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,959
and otherwise i will return the first

219
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:05,600
one right return if if what happened if

220
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,839
what happened what happened if there's

221
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,560
this element is

222
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,360
100

223
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,080
right

224
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,560
if this element x is 100 and the first

225
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:17,839
element to add is at the end right

226
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:20,080
if the element is zero

227
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,959
okay so this element is bigger than that

228
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,480
then

229
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,480
big or equal

230
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,320
it's bigger equal than every 10 i right

231
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,680
so let's let's give an example like if i

232
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,040
want to input x equals 0 look at me

233
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,000
yellow

234
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,959
a i

235
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,720
1 is bigger or equal than 0 so i return

236
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,959
here that's correct

237
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,200
how about one

238
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:44,560
one is bigger or less than i written

239
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:47,040
here correct if it's two

240
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,880
one is smaller than two no and then two

241
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,959
is bigger or equal than two so always i

242
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,399
return that right so that's correct

243
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:55,680
so otherwise i return the length of a

244
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,760
right

245
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,940
all right so what's the time context if

246
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,320
you look at this one

247
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:02,000
[Music]

248
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,480
we're gonna strongly start to the end

249
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,480
what's the time domestic

250
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:11,760
all right right we are not making we are

251
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:14,079
not using the uh advantage of you we are

252
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,279
not getting this advantage of using this

253
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,079
uh

254
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,920
sorted right so we are not using that

255
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,519
why

256
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,320
good question that's what i'm going to

257
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,480
do next okay so look present right so

258
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,320
for example if i said right so this one

259
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,959
needs to be so we just have to change

260
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,440
this equal to bigger right so if it's

261
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,399
equal then i keep going

262
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,720
right

263
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,720
and if it's bigger look four is bigger

264
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,560
than three then i less the insertion

265
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,040
point right so the difference between

266
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,360
bison left and bison right in if it's a

267
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,399
linear search the difference is just

268
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,360
this sign

269
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,680
right because all the bison left

270
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:55,360
by the left is everything needs to

271
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:58,320
strictly smaller than x right

272
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,320
basically like this

273
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,680
it's not because we have this equals

274
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,720
and as we said this is the slope because

275
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,399
we're not using this uh set that the

276
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,760
array is sorted

277
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,120
why

278
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,040
good question then i'm going to

279
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,880
implement this

280
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,920
okay

281
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,200
now let's implement this

282
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,440
define

283
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,519
by set

284
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,320
left

285
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,120
a

286
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,360
x

287
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,360
low equals zero

288
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,640
high equals

289
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:35,440
equals num okay now let's do this

290
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,440
okay first of all if low is smaller than

291
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,120
zero yeah we can't support it that we

292
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,200
can just raise

293
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,000
raised very well or whatever you said

294
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,640
you know very well

295
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,240
okay okay you can put a custom error

296
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,800
message here right

297
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,040
this is this is for computer to screen

298
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,600
that okay you give me a value low which

299
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,480
is negative which i can't handle i'm not

300
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,639
happy

301
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,560
raise exception

302
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,440
or essentially a third is quite similar

303
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,320
okay

304
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,720
then how then look if high

305
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:10,160
is none

306
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:12,959
then i high will be equal to length of

307
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,720
the a right

308
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,639
now we can say

309
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,440
wire

310
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:21,680
low smaller than high

311
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,680
right

312
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,880
what mid

313
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,700
how do i get the middle if i have lower

314
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,320
and half upper

315
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:32,320
[Music]

316
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,650
lower

317
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,360
divided by two right

318
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:37,519
[Music]

319
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,000
okay right

320
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:43,120
so look and now look if

321
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,760
i check the middle yeah if a meat

322
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,480
is smaller than x

323
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,240
if the middle one is smaller than left

324
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,600
then what should we do if the middle one

325
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:56,480
is smaller than legs then

326
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:59,200
the waist is going to be if it if the

327
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:02,079
middle one is smaller than x what what

328
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,079
what's it going to be

329
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,959
look

330
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:10,160
look this is

331
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:13,200
meat here because it's salty right low

332
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:15,600
this is high i don't like it

333
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,680
look if the middle one

334
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,800
even the middle one

335
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,959
yeah yeah

336
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,959
if

337
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:27,120
if the middle one

338
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,360
if the middle one is more if the element

339
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,040
a middle one is smaller than the element

340
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,160
we're looking for so which half is going

341
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,639
to be

342
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:37,360
where's the element going to be

343
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,040
it's in which side

344
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,120
the left

345
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,199
look like it's the middle one it's the

346
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,959
smaller than what are we looking all

347
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:49,040
right yeah so okay so then we say what

348
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:51,360
so we move it to the

349
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:54,000
to the right low equals meat plus one

350
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:57,600
right that's my high spell line

351
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,600
yeah yeah okay that's fine

352
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,800
from the left side so we can say what

353
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,800
pi

354
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,569
[Music]

355
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,880
shorter is better yeah but i'll say he

356
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,800
returned

357
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,920
okay let me just check a little bit yeah

358
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:27,680
return

359
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:29,519
[Music]

360
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,079
okay so actually because the parameter

361
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,079
is low okay

362
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,000
sometimes look

363
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,160
sometimes there's another actual

364
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,399
parameter which default is key so you

365
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,800
can specify how to compute the key so

366
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:45,760
you can put a key here right and if key

367
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,360
isn't it's not empty you can just say

368
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,440
key like

369
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,440
i'm calling the key function

370
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,360
yeah sometimes you can pass the customer

371
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,279
key function in there

372
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,000
uh what's the time complexity for this

373
00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:00,240
one this is biceps

374
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,079
on everyone

375
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,480
what's the time complexity if it is if

376
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,480
we are fine

377
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,240
okay let's try to change this to

378
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,800
look

379
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,680
listen to me listen to me why this is

380
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,440
this is okay because every time we check

381
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,920
this case here

382
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,519
includes the equal sign right so when

383
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,519
it's equal

384
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,240
then we want to move it to the left as

385
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:28,240
as much as we can right so you

386
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,000
eventually you will be at the first

387
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,800
insertion point right

388
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,839
so

389
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:36,160
so look if we try to do this bicep right

390
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:39,360
everything would stay the same but

391
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:42,320
but i just need to change this to bigger

392
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:45,040
than x and then i will swap it to

393
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:47,560
high equals mid

394
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:50,639
as this is equal sign

395
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:53,279
slow equals mid plus one

396
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,199
right so when it's equal then i will i

397
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,279
want to move this insertion point to the

398
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:59,600
right so that's why lower i will move it

399
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,880
to upper upper bound all right towards

400
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,759
the right

401
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,759
everywhere are you all right yes what's

402
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:08,480
the timing of next for this one as well

403
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,480
five cent right

404
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,000
okay so can you explain to me what's the

405
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,080
difference between pisces that's the

406
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,160
best advice

407
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:22,880
[Music]

408
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:25,279
writing is different yeah i'm sorry well

409
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:28,320
the insertion point is different right

410
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:30,079
followed by them let's let's do and this

411
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,720
thing is different come on come on come

412
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:36,180
on come on last time yeah

413
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:39,320
and a line just okay but not

414
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:39,320
[Music]

415
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,800
okay so what's the bite look at this

416
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,959
where's the bison left four you mean not

417
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,199
on the right no no no look this is still

418
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:51,279
why is the left four

419
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:54,240
where it's going to be where do you want

420
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:56,240
to put the four in the second two

421
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,519
four i want to put a four in this

422
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,199
thought to the right so where it's going

423
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,440
to be

424
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,320
where come on

425
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,919
four

426
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:07,600
three five three five so it's in

427
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:10,079
here right

428
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:12,000
right here pointing to five yeah yeah

429
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,880
because let's go where the four is going

430
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,280
to be

431
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,720
okay and bisect right four is it the

432
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:22,160
same one is it the same three no no no

433
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,160
where is going fork on the big one

434
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,959
it's the same it's the center so lonely

435
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,120
difference the only difference is what

436
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,679
the bicep is that duplicate any man

437
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:34,400
right look let's try another one pisces

438
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:37,440
left there's two cheese two okay where's

439
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,280
spicer left one okay yeah what's right

440
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,240
left two which one is going to be the

441
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,200
first time

442
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,720
first two yeah because yeah i said two

443
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,360
the second two

444
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,360
the right okay this is before where

445
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:53,360
yeah three

446
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:55,360
okay so why because right on the left

447
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,600
all the left will be

448
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,360
smaller or equal right but for the left

449
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,600
you will be only the left half will be

450
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,000
only smaller right because if you put a

451
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,240
two here

452
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,360
everything up to the two should be

453
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,520
up to the two only one super yeah i know

454
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:14,720
it's strictly smaller but for the right

455
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:16,960
bicep right this is

456
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,600
treated or is smaller or equal right so

457
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,720
it's here right don't make sense

458
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:26,400
yeah i know it's two sorry if it can be

459
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,400
equal why isn't it two

460
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,240
what do you mean which one the bison

461
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,160
right two right

462
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,240
yeah but it's the right two so we put it

463
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,799
here because everything after this point

464
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,880
is three said it can be you make me two

465
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,280
yeah that's why it's equal to two yeah

466
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,360
you want to expand

467
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:45,679
these not equal to two that's why we put

468
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,919
it here we input it here all right

469
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,919
okay

470
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,640
okay uh

471
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,840
so let's try this let's emulate this one

472
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,360
a little

473
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,820
bit high

474
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,559
meat

475
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:03,360
[Music]

476
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,960
if this point this this meat is bigger

477
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,840
than what we are looking for where is it

478
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:11,440
going to be that's all right

479
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:13,280
if the middle one is bigger than the

480
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,520
element we're going to look for so where

481
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,120
is this going to be left or right come

482
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,360
on

483
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,880
it's here what's this high equals middle

484
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:24,480
is it left or right

485
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,679
high high equals mid right

486
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,200
left

487
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:32,240
not just guessing why look middle

488
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,080
this meter thing a meter bigger than x

489
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,200
right

490
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:40,240
and then high equals mid so it's left

491
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:42,240
i said that yeah left okay yes low

492
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,400
equals me high so you basically moving

493
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,480
this low to the middle yeah

494
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,640
yeah

495
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,160
okay that's it for today good job

496
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,480
say bye bye

497
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:55,120
bye bye

498
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,120
bye
