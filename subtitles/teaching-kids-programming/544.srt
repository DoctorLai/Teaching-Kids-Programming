1
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:11,880
what's a pivot

2
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:15,120
[Music]

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,160
uh pivot in what is it like the sports

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,220
thing like how you pivot like your

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:23,180
netball yeah kind of pivot it's what's

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,180
this word in English

7
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,840
it's funny right remember when we talk

8
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,040
about a quick shot all the result is a

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,480
Lumbers a quick sauce

10
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:36,540
pivot well first of all we choose the

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:39,059
pivot index let's make it five okay

12
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,160
let's choose the last element that's the

13
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:42,200
pivot integer so what do we do with the

14
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,300
pixel

15
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,820
okay just five okay for now so how do we

16
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,700
use the quick saw remember five what

17
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:53,579
numbers are smaller than five here one

18
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,860
two and three okay so three two one okay

19
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:57,960
this is on the left hand side here what

20
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:00,780
numbers are bigger than five nine on

21
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,359
seven nine and seven we can solve this

22
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,939
two recursively there what's the PV

23
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,380
number let's pick one okay I'll pick two

24
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:09,659
you know pick your number does not have

25
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:12,000
to be a particular index so you can

26
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:14,280
randomly pick any Index right or we pick

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,159
these two so we pick these two what's

28
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,860
the number smaller than two one what's

29
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,320
the number the pigments two three each

30
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,600
individual number is 35 and then five

31
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,720
okay so now we six seven what's the

32
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,580
number bigger than seven nine what's the

33
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,680
number smallerness and nothing wait and

34
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,540
now look it's solid right yeah this is

35
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,659
quick so remember we went and we choose

36
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,159
the integer

37
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:39,840
yeah that's a duplicate right it's the

38
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,340
same so the idea of the quick saw

39
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,119
remember we talk about it in early days

40
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,920
we pick a number and we find out the

41
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,240
numbers they're smaller than it and we

42
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,340
find out the numbers bigger than they

43
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,259
only recursive we saw the left and right

44
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,060
part okay this is the one that pivot is

45
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:57,560
wrong okay so not today keep it it's

46
00:01:54,060 --> 00:02:02,399
different you can see that look one two

47
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:04,439
three four five six and here and and

48
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,860
it's the integer number okay

49
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:10,140
so let's say tier a okay n equals a so

50
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:13,680
we want to find this integer pivot

51
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:18,239
integer X so one plus two plus three

52
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:21,720
plus two D to the x equals X Plus X plus

53
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:24,540
one plus X plus two here n okay for

54
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:27,840
example eight so what number why the X

55
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:30,180
Plus X plus one this is the next number

56
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,340
so we want to find out for example you

57
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:35,120
said one plus two plus three plus equals

58
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:39,720
tier x what look

59
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:42,500
one two three four five six seven eight

60
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,760
okay so n equals what's the difference

61
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:48,180
that's a good point we want to find out

62
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:51,720
the X if laser X look n equals a right

63
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:53,819
so can you find a x between if x equals

64
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,099
at least so one plus two plus three plus

65
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:58,920
four equals ten right

66
00:02:56,099 --> 00:03:01,680
four plus five plus six plus seven plus

67
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,540
a it's not equal ten right so we want to

68
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,200
move this x to the left or to the right

69
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:10,080
so let with X is n good point there's

70
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,599
only one cases One X equals n and it

71
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,819
satisfied this okay so basically n

72
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:17,040
equals one then look there's only one

73
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:19,440
number so the left part and the right

74
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,019
part equals one okay this one if we move

75
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,840
the X look this is a cursor right

76
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:26,580
okay we can move left or right let's

77
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,840
move it to the right

78
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,300
here here

79
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,280
One X is here so one plus two plus three

80
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,080
plus four plus five plus six equals one

81
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,599
how do you know if one plus two plus

82
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,819
three plus four is ten

83
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:41,159
you tell me how do we know one plus two

84
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:42,959
plus three plus four equals ten you know

85
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:46,200
how to solve it right yeah

86
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,959
yeah okay okay and then why doesn't

87
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,519
come here tonight then that's a good

88
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,099
point you'll tell me later okay do you

89
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:56,879
understand this question so far

90
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:58,560
yeah okay so when x equals six what's

91
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:01,340
the sum of this one

92
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,340
what's the sum

93
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,299
21 okay

94
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:09,180
what's the sum of this part

95
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:11,519
six of seven six of seven twenty one

96
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:14,459
twenty one okay so we found it x equals

97
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:17,820
six it's satisfied okay but if n equals

98
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:21,000
four one two three four can we find such

99
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:23,460
number X so it's satisfied the left part

100
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,800
and the right part look this x is

101
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:27,120
counted as boundary okay you don't have

102
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,580
to use

103
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,740
it doesn't matter because you can just

104
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:34,500
see one plus three plus three plus four

105
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:36,900
plus five and and is equal to ten plus

106
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,520
eight that's a good observation yes

107
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,500
that's a good observation yes you're

108
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:43,320
right okay because they all plus this

109
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:45,479
one number okay yeah that's a trick a

110
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:48,479
trick okay so coming back to this one

111
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:51,000
one plus two plus three plus four can we

112
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:53,040
find such number X that the left part

113
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,680
the sum of the left side equals the sum

114
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,660
all right no right no right okay so

115
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,940
basically this is the question today

116
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:03,680
any sauce I mean this is very simple

117
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:06,380
question beautiful how do we Brew false

118
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,540
we just checked we just check X right

119
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:11,639
yeah because look you're given this n

120
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:14,220
right you don't give at least n how many

121
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:16,380
possibilities we need to check and and

122
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,360
obviously because they are only n Choice

123
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:20,699
all right okay so I'm losing right now

124
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,039
the proof Force you tell me the time

125
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:27,020
complexity and how do we improve it okay

126
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,020
okay what's today's

127
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:33,780
oh you understand this question pretty

128
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:36,060
well all right one n equals one the

129
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:38,460
answer is one right one nine equals one

130
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:40,560
obviously that's one number so x equals

131
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:44,160
one so the left part is one the right

132
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:48,120
part is one okay so how do we profiles

133
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:51,419
four I in range

134
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:54,720
start from one to n plus one to n

135
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:57,060
inclusive okay the left part okay let's

136
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,800
call it a the sum of the left side will

137
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,720
use the sum function right sum the left

138
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,139
are range

139
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:07,620
start with one two I plus one the right

140
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:10,800
part some Rand

141
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:14,580
start from where I right I includes it

142
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:17,000
to n plus one right and then if a equal

143
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:19,919
equal B return

144
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,820
I otherwise to return minus one right

145
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,400
look

146
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:26,880
simple proofers am I right simple easy

147
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:29,220
so easy exactly okay so how can we

148
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,020
improve it I mean by the way these can

149
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:33,660
be written in one line using the next

150
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:35,280
function return next

151
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:38,819
I

152
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,740
for I in range one to your I plus one if

153
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:43,560
some of this speed equals some of this

154
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:45,660
speed right and the pi default is minus

155
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:48,960
one right if we can't find it okay why

156
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:50,819
aren't you writing the I part sorry

157
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,340
which one why aren't you writing the

158
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:54,840
icon yeah you're too squishy but look

159
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:57,000
next function remember we talked about

160
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,919
next one this is the iterator we're

161
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,220
going to find the first element in the

162
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:06,780
iterator I for I in range one till n

163
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:09,240
plus one and inclusive if a equals B if

164
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:11,400
sum of the first bit less power equal to

165
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,160
sum the right bit right if we can't find

166
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:16,740
it the minus one is the default value if

167
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,360
this iterator is empty okay okay so

168
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:21,419
what's the problem of this one what's

169
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:24,060
the time complexity is this is o n five

170
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:27,240
what's this space

171
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:30,000
o n square right look this is our n

172
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,759
this is o n why there's a loop inside

173
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,660
there are two Loops these two o n right

174
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:39,660
o n inside the loop is o n square right

175
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:42,660
oh it's good that's too slow

176
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:45,060
so you're saying you're saying one plus

177
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:47,880
two plus three plus four plus

178
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:52,560
and do we know how to solve this

179
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:55,259
like the sum and when n equals

180
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:59,280
okay when n equals a hundred what's the

181
00:07:55,259 --> 00:08:01,199
sum uh is it fifty fifty fifty fifty

182
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,180
okay so we know that mathematics

183
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,460
equations to solve that right okay

184
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,620
before coming to this we can also use

185
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:10,580
the prefix sum we can calculate the

186
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:14,039
total sum here right total sum

187
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:16,860
sum of everything right some from one to

188
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:18,900
the end and plus one right and then we

189
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:22,620
can have a prefix on the left part A

190
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:25,860
equals zero a plus equal I okay so I'm

191
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:26,879
telling you okay this total sum

192
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,639
is

193
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:33,839
total the left sum is a what's the sum

194
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:38,899
of the right part this sum is a

195
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,899
two look this is I right this is I yeah

196
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,640
a

197
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:58,019
look because look we talk about eyes

198
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:01,260
inclusive in both leopard and right part

199
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:04,019
right so this left part is a so the

200
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:08,519
right bit the green bit is total minus a

201
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:11,100
plus I right yes yes okay so look this

202
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:14,459
is O and if we do this o n

203
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:16,740
and then we can do this a plus equals I

204
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:18,779
this is accumulate quick exam and then

205
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:21,180
we can use the simple math to calculate

206
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:23,040
the sum of B so instead of b equals

207
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:25,620
right we use this right

208
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,420
yeah and instead of this one we use a

209
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,160
plus equal sign every time we accumulate

210
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:31,800
this sum so what's the time table let's

211
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:34,620
say after this Improvement oh and

212
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:37,200
exactly this is l n and this is of one

213
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:39,720
okay we're done okay

214
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,160
next time here we can use the prefix sum

215
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,660
like this where all we can do is

216
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,279
accumulate right it's the same thing

217
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:47,760
yeah accumulative function we talked

218
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:51,240
about like a cumulate right uh it's the

219
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:53,339
same okay this is a great Improvement we

220
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,800
can do better binary research you

221
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:58,920
remember we pick lamida if I can

222
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:01,200
calculate the last bit and if the lepid

223
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:03,779
the sum of leopard is smaller than a

224
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,720
rapid so how do we move it if the sum of

225
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:09,120
a if the sum of a is smaller than sum of

226
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,160
B is the sum of the left part is smaller

227
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,839
than the sum of the right power so what

228
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,940
do we move to

229
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:17,640
you know we cut into half right and this

230
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:19,740
is the I this is the left boundary R

231
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,899
boundary then this is the meter and I'm

232
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,220
telling you okay now the sum of a this

233
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:26,899
bit

234
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:29,760
this bit a is smaller than the speed B

235
00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:31,560
so where do we move move the Middle

236
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,660
where do we cut into the half to to

237
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:36,899
solve remember the binary search

238
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:39,120
I have a number in my mind from zero to

239
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:40,620
a hundred right

240
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,730
oh it's cutting the middle okay so now

241
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:44,820
look this is

242
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:44,820
[Music]

243
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,260
right obviously right to increase the

244
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:51,300
level and then and the opposite if it's

245
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:53,399
too big now we move to the left remember

246
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:55,740
the mathematic

247
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:57,480
mathematic we talked about that in the

248
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:00,899
early days using the mathematics

249
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:04,620
induction mathematic induction okay so

250
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:06,720
one plus two plus three plus two n

251
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:11,220
what's the sum of it

252
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:15,240
some of it right some I equals 1 to n i

253
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:18,360
this is some I look equals

254
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:23,360
the first item

255
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:23,360
the first item plus the last item

256
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,600
times how many items are there and items

257
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,880
divided by two okay yeah this is the

258
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,860
equation right and we know this equation

259
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,540
obviously we can change this we don't

260
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:39,000
need to accumulate some no we don't need

261
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:42,000
the prefix and we can replace this a

262
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,100
equals B and then P equals we can

263
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,100
directly calculate it am I right okay so

264
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:49,980
what's the sum of three four five six

265
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:52,740
seven eight nine okay what's the sum of

266
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:56,100
these you do improve us yeah four and

267
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:57,540
five and six I mean one easy way three

268
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,820
plus nine

269
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:01,560
yeah it has to be continued three plus

270
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:03,959
nine the first item plus the last item

271
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,160
times how many items are there two four

272
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:07,100
six seven

273
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,420
divided by two okay

274
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:11,940
nine equals

275
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:14,339
um twelve twelve and twelve divided by

276
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,540
two is six six times seven forty two

277
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:18,420
yeah

278
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:21,720
can we verify this three plus four seven

279
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:23,700
twelve eighteen twenty five thirty three

280
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,040
forty two okay yeah you know this

281
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:28,079
equation the first item plus the last

282
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:30,180
item times how many items are there

283
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:33,540
divided by two okay so how do we

284
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:36,060
interpret this this plus this

285
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:37,740
these plus n minus one and how many of

286
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:40,140
them divided by two look remember one

287
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:43,139
plus two plus three till a hundred how

288
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:46,200
do we know it's 50 50. one plus a

289
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:47,820
hundred is a hundred and one two plus

290
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,100
ninety nine

291
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:53,639
is a hundred and one How many pairs of

292
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:56,579
that fifty pairs of that so 50 times 101

293
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:57,420
is 50 50. that's why we got it okay make

294
00:12:56,579 --> 00:12:59,700
sense

295
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:02,100
yeah okay okay so we know these tricks

296
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:04,320
to compute the sum of you know of

297
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:07,019
continuous the left part and right part

298
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,680
we can do this uh final research okay

299
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:12,360
final research

300
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:15,899
and tell me that you think about a time

301
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,800
complexity the last is ah the right is n

302
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:20,600
right

303
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:23,700
wire left probably small

304
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:27,060
yeah yeah yeah this one okay left is the

305
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:28,680
you know because one two here and right

306
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:30,839
right the left part of the way at the

307
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:34,019
beginning the right boundary the meter

308
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:35,760
is a plus r divided by two or six

309
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:38,459
through sixty one right these two

310
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,540
calculated first the left path what's

311
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:43,800
the sum

312
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:45,839
1 plus M right times how many n divided

313
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,220
by two all right the right part we know

314
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:52,200
the sum right

315
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:54,360
M plus n right there's a problem here

316
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:57,300
because difficulty

317
00:13:54,360 --> 00:14:01,079
we got a problem look this is one this

318
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:03,600
is n okay this is the middle so when we

319
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:06,000
calculate this meter yeah this meter is

320
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,680
just a place to representative we

321
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,600
calculate sum so we're not calculating

322
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,420
this speed of sound we calculating the

323
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,880
whole bit okay so let's one

324
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:18,480
one plus n times n divided by two and N

325
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:20,880
plus n times how many numbers between n

326
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,940
to n how many numbers

327
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,200
[Music]

328
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:28,560
and

329
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:31,380
minus n plus one right you forgot the

330
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:34,800
plus one y look three to four how many

331
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:36,779
numbers two so how do we get a two four

332
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,200
minus three that's one we need to plus

333
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:39,200
one here

334
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:59,100
so we need to move it to the right right

335
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:02,220
move it to the right so

336
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:04,380
the left equals mid plus one okay so you

337
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:08,940
tell me what's next if a is bigger than

338
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:10,139
b so what do we do here move it

339
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:12,740
um

340
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:15,740
yeah how do we move it to the right

341
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:15,740
minus

342
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:22,260
one yeah and otherwise we can't find it

343
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:24,860
minus one okay the term for next what's

344
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,860
final result

345
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,959
yeah because every time you cut in half

346
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,660
yeah you cut in half

347
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:35,279
there are a hundred numbers and every

348
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:37,860
time you cut in half how many car

349
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:41,639
maximum how many times up to 25

350
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:43,980
oh look it's Locker two to the power 100

351
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:45,480
right so right this is the number of

352
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:48,060
times every time you cut in the half in

353
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,839
the search space it's never down Okay oh

354
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:51,180
okay

355
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:53,459
we can do better

356
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:55,980
so this is a great Improvement okay so

357
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:59,240
how can we do better

358
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:59,240
yeah we can look

359
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:09,839
is one plus x times x divided by 2y

360
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:12,720
this is a right this is a this is X here

361
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,680
all right yeah and what's the sum of

362
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,260
this bit

363
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,779
what's the summer is it equals the sum

364
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:22,500
of everything minus B right

365
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:24,480
all right yeah so the sum minus this

366
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:27,300
should be plus X okay so the sum sum of

367
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:31,079
everything is n times n plus 1 divided

368
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:34,199
by two minus the left field right minus

369
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:36,660
left it one plus x times x divided by 2

370
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:38,759
plus x what

371
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:41,339
this is one

372
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:44,100
this is n and we want to find if there's

373
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:47,880
an X here right so the left bit the sum

374
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:49,860
of a rapid this is the sum of 11. the

375
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:52,199
sum of everything is this one right the

376
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:55,620
sum of everything

377
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:57,600
minus that this bit this bit minus this

378
00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:00,360
bit is this bit right

379
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,579
five to plus X here plus X here right

380
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:06,839
plus X here right

381
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:10,620
okay so let's solve this problem okay so

382
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:14,339
look this one one plus x times x divided

383
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:15,720
by two let's move to the left plus one

384
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:16,860
plus X

385
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:20,760
yeah

386
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:23,100
and then minus x equals n and plus one

387
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:26,880
divided by two right

388
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:28,980
look these two added together look half

389
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,320
of this plus half of this equals what

390
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:33,320
half of least plus half of this equals

391
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:37,020
what

392
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:38,340
this one yeah so one plus x times x

393
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:40,620
minus X

394
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:43,860
because this this bit is the total sum

395
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:45,480
right total sum okay so what's this do

396
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,559
you know how to kick it at least yeah

397
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:51,480
yeah

398
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:55,500
so X Plus x squared minus x equals X

399
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:58,380
l so x squared equals x so what's x x

400
00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:01,320
equals square root of x and we just have

401
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:06,419
to check if this is a whole integer so s

402
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:08,460
equals n times n plus 1 divided by 2.

403
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:11,280
okay and then square root

404
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:16,380
so x equals square root

405
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:18,919
of s if x dot is integer if it's an

406
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,919
integer right

407
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:24,780
then return

408
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:25,500
integer part of X otherwise return minus

409
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,900
one

410
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:30,900
what's the time probability

411
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:32,580
you know this answer a one yes a one

412
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:35,400
what

413
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:38,059
if this function this is amortized

414
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:41,900
what's this word amortize

415
00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:44,820
amortize 201 right because in modern

416
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:48,360
computers the processor the CPU computer

417
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:50,900
what's CPU I talked about this before

418
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:55,020
CPU this is the brain of Computer

419
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:57,780
Central Processing Unit the brand of

420
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:59,880
computer in Grain of computer knows how

421
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:03,480
to deal with this sqrt square root he

422
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:05,700
knows how to calculate the square root

423
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:08,460
of any number very efficiently so we

424
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:11,400
treat it as this function as amortized

425
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:13,799
or one right but mathematics

426
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:16,520
we just try to compute this so which one

427
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:16,520
is the fastest

428
00:19:17,179 --> 00:19:22,260
yeah obviously this one yeah and there's

429
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:25,320
no loop I just calculate the square root

430
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:28,500
right how to get this we just prove it

431
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:30,059
right okay so to sum up the beginning we

432
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,340
talked about the book first I'm just

433
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:34,440
checking every possibility but let's

434
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:37,799
avoid the square and we made a slight

435
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:40,320
Improvement because we don't need to

436
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:42,720
calculate the sum of the left part and

437
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,900
right part using the for Loop we can use

438
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:48,660
the accumulate prefix sum right and then

439
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:50,820
we can follow improve it by using the

440
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:54,120
mathematic equation right

441
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:57,840
to calculate the sum of any consecutive

442
00:19:54,120 --> 00:20:00,539
numbers right and further we improve it

443
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:03,900
using binary search let's bring down the

444
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:05,520
complexity to our login and then we try

445
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,960
to solve this equation and basically

446
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,059
we'll try to find out this using

447
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,980
mathematics equations and we'll find out

448
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:13,980
x equals square root of x

449
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:16,880
and then we just calculate it okay what

450
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,880
have you learned that's it

451
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:26,460
yes

452
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:28,980
what's the problem and what kind of

453
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:30,299
eggplant have we learned before what's

454
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:32,419
the problem first of all what's the

455
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:32,419
problem

456
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:42,600
numbers what's the what's the distance

457
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:47,600
come on say mom please

458
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:47,600
um we have numbers anyway what numbers

459
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:52,740
normal numbers what's a normal number

460
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:54,419
can you give me an example like what are

461
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,860
we trying to do three four five eight

462
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:57,780
seven yeah yeah what do you call these

463
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:59,280
numbers nature numbers right

464
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:02,220
yeah we have these natural numbers

465
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,960
natural natural numbers natural is

466
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:06,600
normal

467
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:08,700
naturally is a synonym for mention

468
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:11,460
numbers natural positive integer right

469
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:14,580
one two three four five here and find

470
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:17,700
out if laser pivot yeah if you like a

471
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:20,640
pivot integer that the sum of the left

472
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:24,660
part inclusive X is equals the sum of

473
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:26,580
the right path inclusive X right

474
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,670
and what kind of way have you learned

475
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:30,749
today

476
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:30,749
[Music]

477
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:37,700
mass and

478
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:40,140
one more let me see numbers

479
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:44,220
one you divide into two what do you call

480
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:46,559
it binary binary search every time we

481
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:48,480
cut it in half right and the last one is

482
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:50,820
we start with using the pure mathematics

483
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,760
all right yeah and the most efficient

484
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:56,039
solution is using mathematics all right

485
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:59,100
and the first three the first three

486
00:21:56,039 --> 00:22:00,960
approach are computer algorithm the last

487
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,919
one is more like mathematic thinking

488
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:06,860
okay

489
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:06,860
yes okay that's it for today bye bye
