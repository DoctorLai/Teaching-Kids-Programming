1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:06,799
hello hello mr are you right yeah okay

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,679
so yeah we have been talking about this

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,040
uh jin human gym problem yeah we have

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:15,280
this a

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:17,359
so this is the dna thing a pair with t

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,920
c pair with g

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,920
right a p plus t c but g and then it

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,920
could be many many right

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,220
so we want to find out

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,359
the

11
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:30,359
[Music]

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,359
gene mutation group right gene mutation

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,600
what gene mutation group it differs only

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,559
by one gene right for example a c c t

15
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,239
and

16
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,239
c c c t

17
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,559
it belongs to the same mutation group

18
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,800
because the only one difference

19
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,879
and a g c

20
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,680
t t

21
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,480
a

22
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,280
g

23
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,000
t

24
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:58,079
d t belongs to the same group right

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,480
but a g t c t is not right because

26
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,879
differs on this one and this one is

27
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,760
right different but this one

28
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,760
and then this one

29
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,400
is it looks

30
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,600
yes but but okay that's the thing look

31
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,759
because this one connects to the second

32
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,040
one right so this one yeah

33
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:27,520
a g c t

34
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,159
a g t t t and the second connects to the

35
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,040
c

36
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,840
a g t c t right yeah

37
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,119
yeah

38
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,360
so these two belongs to the same

39
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,600
mutation group okay

40
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,280
they understand because they

41
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,960
there's a connection

42
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,799
right so

43
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,960
the first day the day before yesterday

44
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,720
we talked about different search

45
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,439
yesterday we talked about preferences

46
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,119
right so this is a graph problem graph

47
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,280
problem

48
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,040
graph

49
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,759
how do you

50
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,560
how do you spell graph gr aph

51
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,159
it's a graph is the collection of vertex

52
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,759
and an edges

53
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,000
right

54
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:09,679
and then now we have one vertex this

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,800
vertex is the genes right the gene group

56
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,560
the gene

57
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,959
and where are the edges where to the

58
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,959
energies

59
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:19,840
[Music]

60
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,200
yeah but the problem you see this

61
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,680
problem

62
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,760
statement does not give you the edges

63
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,959
directly right it does not tell you okay

64
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,280
we these two

65
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,760
gene belongs to this edge there is no

66
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,920
but how do we find it now

67
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,800
that's a rule right we check if these

68
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,440
two

69
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,599
belongs to some mutation group but only

70
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,120
one right so if like there's one thing

71
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,680
one letter difference then there's an

72
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,160
edge right yeah and our test is that

73
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,360
look we have a server

74
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,800
server

75
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,800
vertex seven gene connected by uh

76
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,120
by edges and we want to find out how

77
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,440
many number of the connected groups in

78
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,640
this case there's two right

79
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,080
do you still remember the different

80
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,080
search

81
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,120
research is

82
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,200
traveling by you're like

83
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,560
traveling from a note to note by

84
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,360
traveling along the edges yeah exactly

85
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,159
so

86
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,400
yeah

87
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,480
and then you go no more that's right i

88
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,360
know yeah

89
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,959
yeah

90
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,959
quite right yeah you're quite right

91
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,640
so

92
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,799
so i'm just writing that

93
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:33,120
last thing again okay

94
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:35,840
define okay let's say fine number

95
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:39,040
of mutation group

96
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:41,840
and i'm given a gene look at these genes

97
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,640
these genes are vertex right

98
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,200
okay

99
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,519
so look we have uh

100
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,280
we have a definition of preferences yeah

101
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,480
this is could be definitely perfect

102
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,480
branch i know

103
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,159
we just

104
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,480
yeah we just don't implement here right

105
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:01,200
now so look we have answer this is the

106
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,200
number of group then we can say 4i in

107
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,319
gene right those who leave each gene

108
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,200
group

109
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,400
right

110
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,159
and

111
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,400
if i

112
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,760
still in left remember the first one the

113
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,920
left left equals saying

114
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,239
gene

115
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,959
if still in the left

116
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:24,320
and then we do a test search

117
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,320
i right next to the search i and then

118
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,360
answer plus equal one

119
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,280
right look yeah

120
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,680
so what with this different search you

121
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,160
will remove all the vertex that

122
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,240
connected to i okay all right

123
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,560
we can answer yeah we talked about that

124
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,600
the day before yesterday look

125
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,360
this i will go through this i look this

126
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,680
is the gene yeah there might be some

127
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,160
group right some group like that right

128
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,000
right here goes only i

129
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,960
and then once i do this step for search

130
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,800
i

131
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,600
then i the first thing i need to do is i

132
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,120
don't remove a uh g don't left and

133
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,039
remove a

134
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,639
so what does it do

135
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,639
then you will remove it from the genes

136
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,880
right remove it from genes

137
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,840
so you remove all these things so next

138
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:12,639
time you go here look i found another

139
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,280
group right i found another group

140
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,440
so answering comparative one and look at

141
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,000
this definition

142
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,600
the order of marking the nodes doesn't

143
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,039
matter here right that's why we can use

144
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,560
the preferences

145
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,039
makes sense

146
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,560
because all my target is to what all my

147
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,240
target is to what

148
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,440
to remove all these

149
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,120
as a whole i don't care in all order i

150
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,240
remove them right

151
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,000
make sense

152
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,759
so i can do breakfast search i can do

153
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,600
different search therefore search

154
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,560
recursion stack preference search using

155
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,479
the queue level by level right look this

156
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,720
is this is one this is two three three

157
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:51,199
four therefore search

158
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,199
all right the first search one two four

159
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:56,400
three breakfast search

160
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:59,120
one two three four make sense

161
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,120
okay so

162
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,360
do you still remember a data structure

163
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,560
which is perfect for it for this kind of

164
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,479
purpose

165
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,880
right so we want to find out the number

166
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:11,440
of the groups and we at the beginning we

167
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,560
have n groups and then we can if there's

168
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,360
an edge

169
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,039
we mark it as a group even less than h

170
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,840
we mark it as a group and then we can

171
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:23,600
find out the number of

172
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,600
groups what do you call it remember

173
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,360
do you still remember

174
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,759
a data structure

175
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,120
yes exactly this joint set these tunes

176
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:36,080
are unified

177
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:38,639
this joint set this joint set okay and

178
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,039
usually we can do this union fight so

179
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,039
what does the union find so this station

180
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,880
is a status structure which supports at

181
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:47,039
least these two kind of

182
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,199
operations which is unit

183
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:52,240
which is where another one is fine so

184
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:55,919
union you have two groups you union and

185
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:58,960
together union united in union find

186
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:01,199
you can tell if a vertex

187
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,120
element belongs to which group

188
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,360
right okay

189
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,360
so

190
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,479
i'm just quickly writing this at this

191
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,560
june set thingy okay

192
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,080
i think we talked about a long time ago

193
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,000
and you may forget a little bit but

194
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,240
that's all right so we can revisit it

195
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,240
now

196
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,080
defy

197
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:27,599
union find okay let's let's unify

198
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,400
that's a class

199
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,840
or actually that's a class class

200
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,599
and then we have an

201
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,199
indeed

202
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,560
in it

203
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,800
uh

204
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,520
which is the constructor

205
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,319
and now we have what sizes we want to

206
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,280
put a size which is a dictionary and we

207
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,400
can

208
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,560
have uh

209
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,199
you you can implement this as a fixed

210
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,919
size you can pass a parameter which is n

211
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,360
and

212
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,720
a number of groups

213
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,400
right if you know

214
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,160
if you know the number of groups then

215
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,840
you can pass the n and then create a

216
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,440
static array

217
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,039
which end size

218
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,199
with an element but we now use the

219
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,120
dictionary which is the more flexible

220
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:10,240
okay it's left of parent

221
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:13,199
parent that's koi pak okay

222
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,720
okay and then two two things one is the

223
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:19,199
five

224
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:21,440
five union and fine let's say one five a

225
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,919
yeah if it's not in there then we return

226
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,919
what if we want to find it

227
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,080
so if it's not in there what should we

228
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,080
do

229
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,360
what should we do

230
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:35,440
[Music]

231
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,640
we first of all if a is not in

232
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,640
not in

233
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:42,399
serve the parent right if it's not there

234
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:45,039
if it's not there

235
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,039
what should we do

236
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,440
so look if an element is not in a in a

237
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,440
parent then we want to set it up right

238
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,880
we want to set it right

239
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,560
yeah so we can say select or parent

240
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,440
sorry second

241
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,600
yeah

242
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,399
a equals one

243
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,920
a okay it belongs to itself

244
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,399
right if it's not a

245
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,880
if it belongs to the cell the

246
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,480
landline sizes at the beginning size a

247
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,080
will be equal to one and then we can

248
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,399
just return

249
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,959
return what return we want to return the

250
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:28,320
number of uh the group group which is

251
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,920
this right a okay so look at this

252
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,480
actually

253
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,959
this is okay so this is a class so we

254
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,440
need to uh we need to put the first

255
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:40,480
parameter excel to say it's a class

256
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,279
method okay say self a

257
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,920
right

258
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,519
otherwise look if

259
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,760
if not

260
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:52,399
okay if cell

261
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:55,680
dot parent a not equal a right if this

262
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:58,680
is not group then we can say what

263
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,680
self.parent

264
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,200
a

265
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,680
equals self

266
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,360
save define

267
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,959
file and then we pass this in okay self

268
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,560
dot parent a

269
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:13,519
okay

270
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:17,120
and then we we do this return

271
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,800
send the paragraph i expanded it a bit

272
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,040
so this thing okay we want to find a

273
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,800
pair we want to find its parent and look

274
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,640
if it's apparently it's not there like

275
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,880
we put it we set it to the parent and

276
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,399
then we can also send the size and

277
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,920
reconnect

278
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:33,680
if this look

279
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:35,839
what does mean look if this is ah okay

280
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,279
if these edges look eric i want to find

281
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,120
this

282
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,320
yeah i want to find this

283
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,720
a

284
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,440
but now it points to b and it points to

285
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,480
c

286
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,560
so because a's parent is not a and then

287
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,600
i need to do what so let me save the

288
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,880
parent a equals i find this one

289
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,200
and which is

290
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,360
again points to b so eventually i want

291
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,200
to compress the path because look

292
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,360
eventually even

293
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,760
if a path is too long then this

294
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:07,279
operation says the path find it will be

295
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:09,440
take a linear time right so if i do this

296
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,680
the next time i know i want to point it

297
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,480
to what i want to point here to here i

298
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,279
want to point this thing to here okay i

299
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,000
want to

300
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:20,480
shorten the path to look it up

301
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,800
right so ideally i want i want this kind

302
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,680
of structure this is parent this is

303
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,480
group a and i have these two that

304
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,800
belongs to the same group okay yeah

305
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,800
you see

306
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,519
these

307
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,600
these look two three four five and one

308
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,240
belongs to the same group one points to

309
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,480
itself which is points parent a two

310
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,560
parent points to parent a right to

311
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,959
parent one one points to parent one

312
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,360
right so that's why it is we can say

313
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:54,320
this is better than this

314
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,959
this is better than that yeah

315
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,720
yeah if you keep a union file status

316
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:01,279
check it like that what kind of problem

317
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,279
would be like

318
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,360
it will increase the lookup time right

319
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,320
because look i want to take the i want

320
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:11,760
to check out the go what's the group for

321
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,959
the tournament what

322
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,600
he said okay

323
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:18,560
it's the group it's the same group as

324
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,920
four okay what's four central three two

325
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,800
one you need to

326
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:25,519
look it up here so it takes time right

327
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:28,720
to go this way up right

328
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:31,519
but now look i i get get this parent and

329
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,839
then i reset it i reset it

330
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,680
so look five eventually you tell me is

331
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,079
one right yeah

332
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,920
so instead of pointing to four i then

333
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,120
point to one

334
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,279
four

335
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,760
you'll tell me it's one right

336
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:47,680
right but now it points to three

337
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,600
so to the next time i don't want to go

338
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,600
through this again so i point to one

339
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,839
three

340
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,360
to one right it's the same group as one

341
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,360
power now it tells me it's the same

342
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,320
group as two so now what do i do i point

343
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:03,279
to two all right so in this case

344
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,360
a strawberry a star right so what so

345
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,360
next time look two

346
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,120
what's the parent of two it's the same

347
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,560
as one okay one is one and that's just

348
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,760
one one

349
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:15,040
why does the note five have two arrows

350
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,959
okay okay

351
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,440
yeah it's the same yeah you see

352
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:22,000
do you see this guy getting it

353
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,320
so this this is called the compress

354
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,200
compress the path when looking

355
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,560
compress path when look up

356
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,720
look up okay

357
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,959
so self defined okay this is centrifugal

358
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,760
and then with the self define

359
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:39,200
we have also another uh which is called

360
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,200
union right union

361
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:43,279
which just needs to

362
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,240
get the thing union

363
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,760
union what does union do

364
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,000
union will put

365
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,800
you will tell okay two notes belongs to

366
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,800
the same right

367
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,320
define

368
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,320
union

369
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,120
cell

370
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,920
a b okay so then i

371
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,000
what should i do with that

372
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,399
first of all we need to check if two

373
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,760
equals the same right so now look we can

374
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,760
say okay uh

375
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,240
a

376
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:18,240
let's say x equals seven five we know

377
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,199
their self to find

378
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,600
a right and then y equals sev

379
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:25,360
to find b

380
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,120
if like belongs to the same group what

381
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,040
should we do

382
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,720
what should we do

383
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,519
we've already that belongs to the center

384
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:36,079
what should we do we just relax

385
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:38,000
that's a very good answer relax yeah we

386
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:40,240
turn we can just return yeah because

387
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,240
it's already in the same curve right

388
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,600
yeah in the same group

389
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,920
just return

390
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,440
okay now now look again again let's

391
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,040
visually look

392
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,959
so i have these

393
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,160
uh i have uh

394
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:55,120
these

395
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,040
only only one two three four four notes

396
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:01,120
and then i have

397
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,120
i have like a 100 here

398
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,360
so do you think okay

399
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:10,160
so now i'm i'm telling you like okay i

400
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,399
want to this this

401
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,800
yeah this is a this is b

402
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,240
now i tell you i want to union a a and b

403
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,160
so do you think

404
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,760
which one is better putting a to b or

405
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,480
putting b to a

406
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:26,079
a to b why is that because

407
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:28,480
a has less less notes

408
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:30,320
if okay if we put in b to a what

409
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,959
happened

410
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,959
it take

411
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,720
well what happened i mean what happened

412
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:40,480
what do you think because eventually

413
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:42,959
look if you put the b to a then the next

414
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,120
one the lookup you will have more

415
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:47,519
notes to compress right you have more

416
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,320
notes to handle because these eventually

417
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,680
will be relocated the path right so it

418
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,880
will be more work

419
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:57,759
to relocate all these nodes to to as we

420
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,680
assigned to a right but now if you look

421
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,120
if there's just one or two nodes you can

422
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,040
just do it why not to know that will be

423
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,800
easier right yeah

424
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,279
so then we need to

425
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:11,600
tell the sizes if

426
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:11,600
if the size is

427
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:17,839
x right is x right

428
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:21,040
smaller or if it's smaller than seven

429
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,040
sizes b

430
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:27,120
all right why and then we just swap it

431
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:30,000
how do we swap it x y how do we solve it

432
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,000
how do we solve it

433
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:35,360
how do we solve it if we want to solve

434
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:39,040
something something equals something

435
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:41,279
okay so x y equals y x

436
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:44,480
and now i want to

437
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:48,079
now x is thicker so i want to

438
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:51,120
merge y to x y so i have to say

439
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:54,240
serve the parent

440
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,560
i want to put the y to x

441
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,680
x is bigger x is bigger

442
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:02,480
so i want to assign b the parent of b y

443
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,360
equal to x y equals x

444
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,600
right

445
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,520
and then now i want to update the sizes

446
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,480
so served

447
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,559
the

448
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,679
size is

449
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,559
size is

450
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,319
x right because i put a y to x so the x

451
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:20,880
sizes will be

452
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:22,640
having addition of original set of sizes

453
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,839
why right

454
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,799
yeah

455
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:28,799
right makes sense

456
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,720
uh we can return the force here and then

457
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:33,520
we can return true here

458
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,840
right to make to to indicate whether we

459
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,160
succeed the

460
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,000
the the union right

461
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,200
make sense

462
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,360
yeah

463
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,720
if if the size is a uh x smaller than y

464
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,040
yes

465
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,640
okay

466
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:55,520
[Music]

467
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,520
a a is bigger than okay a is bigger

468
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,799
yes yes

469
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,160
all right yeah

470
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,559
um

471
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,480
okay and then another operation is to

472
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,480
get the count right to get account

473
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,840
define count

474
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,520
how self

475
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,799
this retains the number of connected

476
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,880
groups right

477
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:16,799
so it's uh it's a property property

478
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,600
value you can say property

479
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:22,799
property value here property value

480
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,919
so with this one we can just return

481
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:26,640
return

482
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:29,840
uh return the number of cards pretend if

483
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:32,080
the parent parent is a dictionary x uh

484
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:35,280
if it's a group right if it's a group

485
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:38,160
then x will be the same value with x

486
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:40,480
right so i can just return y

487
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:43,120
reason why

488
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:47,520
i need to sum

489
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:48,400
okay somewhat x equals or y

490
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,760
for

491
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,600
x y

492
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,559
in self

493
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,480
dot parent dot item right

494
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:58,400
all right

495
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,720
right

496
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,840
okay so this is the union file okay this

497
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:06,320
is the universe how can we use it as the

498
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,960
uh how can we use it how can we use it

499
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:12,640
in solving this kind of problem here

500
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,640
how can we use this installing time

501
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:18,640
[Music]

502
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:21,120
so we can look all right look

503
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,679
let's let's look at this okay

504
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:26,000
we haven't known right yeah

505
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:28,799
we have a that's a few notes

506
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,559
right so look if we know these neighbors

507
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,760
we can just union there yeah you need

508
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,640
union

509
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:36,480
yeah union these and then we can union

510
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,960
this and then later we just find out how

511
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,600
many connected groups all right make

512
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,760
sense oh yeah so it'll be easier it'll

513
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,360
be very straightforward intuitive right

514
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,960
intuitive

515
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:53,480
let's say define let's say fine

516
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,480
grooves fine grooves mutations

517
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,880
okay so now again again we want to find

518
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,120
out what we want to find out the g

519
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,760
equals g sets of g what what's the

520
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:07,080
advantage if we convert the list to the

521
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,080
it will be

522
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:15,200
okay now union phi equals union sign

523
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,320
that we we just defined this structure

524
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,360
and then

525
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:21,840
we go through that list therefore

526
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:24,080
i in g

527
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,880
f i ing

528
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,720
now we want to find out for

529
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,720
okay let's say for j

530
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,039
in range

531
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,880
length i right we want to stop we want

532
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:36,480
just find out the neighbors

533
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,600
all right

534
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,919
hey

535
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,640
why are you drawing my desk it looks

536
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:45,120
good a c c we want to find out the

537
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:48,159
neighbor how do we find out the neighbor

538
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,159
a equals

539
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,240
so for each letter i want to try try the

540
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,080
neighbors right and i want to find out

541
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,159
if it's in there right so look the

542
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,039
neighbor will be what uh

543
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,679
g

544
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:15,200
up to i i want up i want to pick the up

545
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:17,120
to i choice and replace with okay

546
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,320
i i need to go through that thing again

547
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:22,480
for x in

548
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,320
a

549
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,280
c

550
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,240
t

551
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:32,720
g right this is the four choices

552
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:34,240
and then then this column one is what

553
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,159
i

554
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:39,760
up to j

555
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:42,840
plus x plus i

556
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:46,159
j plus one to the n right

557
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:48,000
yeah okay so look

558
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:51,120
look at cameron you already look

559
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,080
currently this is j here right so what's

560
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:57,039
his neighbor i can pick the

561
00:21:54,080 --> 00:22:00,480
letter up to it which is a and plus

562
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:01,919
plus their fourth choice yeah a c t g

563
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,640
and then plus one

564
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:06,559
plus the the next letter after it will

565
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,640
be ct right

566
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:11,600
do you get it

567
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,760
this is what it means here so when i am

568
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:16,720
at index j

569
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:19,679
i i have four choice and then i can pick

570
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:22,480
the choice pick the letters before it

571
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,360
and the letter after it concatenate it

572
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,440
right

573
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:28,080
i know what what's next

574
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,200
then i can say if

575
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,559
n

576
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:36,240
is in g right this is one lookup right

577
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:37,919
i know what's what do we do uf dot union

578
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,960
u n

579
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,720
i o n union i

580
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,600
with n

581
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:48,799
and now what do we do return

582
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:50,960
uf dot com

583
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,679
okay this is a property so we don't use

584
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,840
the

585
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,840
bracket to call it right yeah

586
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,679
all right

587
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,679

591
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:09,600
do you understand this one

592
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:11,440
look let me repeat again a little bit

593
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,440
let me repeat

union file we define this unified data

595
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,320
structure set we convert a list of

596
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:23,799
vertex g

597
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:23,799
to g so we can use the one constant

598
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:32,240
okay look when we go through each each

599
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,000
vertex

600
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,320
for each vertex

601
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,799
i generate its neighbor which is this

602
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:42,000
mutation right this is generally the

603
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:42,000
mutation mutation

604
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:48,480
okay what's this i'm testing what's this

605
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,480
that's if

606
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,630
the mutation

[Music]

608
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,480
vertex right yeah if we have robotics in

609
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,919
a group then what should we do now

610
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,159
we shall

611
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:04,400
um look for a

612
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,400
c

[Music]

614
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,360
and what's n

615
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:22,400
[Music]

616
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:24,080
what's this

617
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,600
the neighbor

618
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,080
neighbor so there will be four neighbors

619
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,960
so look i'm i'm visiting

620
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:33,440
vertex i right

621
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,600
i want to division and i

622
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,760
connect all its neighbor okay so here

623
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,000
there's a mistake here i need to remove

624
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,480
it g don't remove it do i need to remove

625
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,840
it yes because i already visited i need

626
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:48,000
to remove here am i

627
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,919
do i need to remove it probably not

628
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,120
right do i need to

629
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,120
do i need to probably know

630
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:02,559
properly we don't need to remove it so

631
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:05,360
we need to remove it

632
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:07,120
we can union it

633
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,559
we probably don't need to remove it we

634
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,600
probably don't need to remove it in this

635
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:14,080
case so if it's already in energy if if

636
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:17,120
we have this vertex in in the graph then

637
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:19,840
we union i because i and n are neighbors

638
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:22,000
they belong to the same group right so

639
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,039
yeah

640
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,600
yeah

641
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:26,840
okay so let's see in the same group okay

642
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,799
so let's try

643
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,679
okay

644
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,600
yeah

645
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,279
let me write it and can you simulate

646
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,000
this process

647
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:37,279
okay can you simulate it okay i have

648
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,960
this

649
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:44,880
a c t let's just try easy

650
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,880
okay c c t

651
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,120

00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,480
and then wave

655
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:54,400
c c

656
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,760
a okay and then

657
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,320
t

658
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:00,799
t t p okay so there are four they have

659
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,240
one two three four five finals union

660
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:03,919
five

661
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,039
okay you can say over one two three four

662
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:10,159
five the least okay

663
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:12,080
yeah yeah that's fine so i'm here atg

664
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:14,080
okay i'm a ct

665
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,640
so now what should i do where is

666
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:18,400
neighbor which one is neighbor n

667
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,360
yeah yeah neighbor so which one would

668
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,360
you know is his neighbor

669
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:26,720
this one okay so i connected yeah

670
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,159
okay does it have another other neighbor

671
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,960
with this one

672
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:29,760
uh

673
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,000
uh

674
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:34,320
no right not directly right okay

675
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,919
okay so now i try with this one probably

676
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,360
yeah we don't need to remove it if a new

677
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,480
movie that would be a mistake we don't

678
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,880
know

679
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,799
cct where's the yeah

680
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,720
you see okay and then

681
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:46,880
does it have any other no

682
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,679
okay

683
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,679
what's his neighbor

684
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,420
generally it's neighbor which one is a

685
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,559
his neighbor

686
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:56,159

00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:59,279
yeah okay

688
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,799
okay and then cca

689
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:02,240
cca

690
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,760
which is neighbor this one but we

691
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,640
already merge it that's fine we can do

692
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:08,799
it again yeah and tta okay so that's why

693
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,640
we don't remove it okay yeah if we move

694
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:13,840
it what happened if we don't move it

695
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:15,360
then for example here i i join this one

696
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,360
and then we move it

697
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,720
and i can't find this this one

698
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:21,120
do you get it

699
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,720
if we remove it and who who connects to

700
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,640
this nothing

701
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,600
right but we eventually we need these to

702
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:30,159
connect this so after this uf.com what's

703
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,159
the answer

704
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:35,279
we're done that's it

705
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:37,520
got it make sense yeah so which one do

706
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:39,200
you think that better i mean you can you

707
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,080
you understand the most

708
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,919
or you

709
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,799
you can implement it

710
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:46,159
how many ways of solving this problem

711
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:47,279
about

712
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:50,960
a lot

713
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:53,520
how many days we we talked about this

714
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,279
uh a few

715
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,279
what what is the field i mean how many

716
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:59,520
days we saw so many yesterday we talked

717
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:00,480
about what

718
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,080
we

719
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:06,080
we talked about the gene being released

720
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,919
yeah i know it's the same thing so what

721
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,120
kind of agreement i just talked at the

722
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,720
beginning

723
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:15,320
what kind of agreement

724
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:15,320
to solve the problem how to research

725
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:21,039
yeah okay professor steph associates

726
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,279
union fan so how many ways of doing it

727
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:25,760
three okay which one you think you can

728
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:28,399
