00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:14,950

[Applause]

2
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:14,960

 

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,950

notation okay

4
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:16,960
notation okay
 

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,109
notation okay
so i'm gonna explain to you

6
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:19,119
so i'm gonna explain to you
 

7
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,269
so i'm gonna explain to you
okay come now look

8
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:21,279
okay come now look
 

9
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,109
okay come now look
if i want to calculate three you know

10
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:23,119
if i want to calculate three you know
 

11
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:23,830
if i want to calculate three you know
the

12
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:23,840
the
 

13
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,070
the
normal mathematic let's say three plus

14
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:26,080
normal mathematic let's say three plus
 

15
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,830
normal mathematic let's say three plus
two times four what's the answer

16
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:28,840
two times four what's the answer
 

17
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,069
two times four what's the answer
um eleven eleven okay so why is either

18
00:00:32,069 --> 00:00:32,079
um eleven eleven okay so why is either
 

19
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,229
um eleven eleven okay so why is either
when we because the multiplication

20
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:34,239
when we because the multiplication
 

21
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:35,590
when we because the multiplication
multiply

22
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:35,600
multiply
 

23
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,470
multiply
yeah takes priority over the plus right

24
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:38,480
yeah takes priority over the plus right
 

25
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,670
yeah takes priority over the plus right
so we calculate multiply first right so

26
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:41,680
so we calculate multiply first right so
 

27
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,029
so we calculate multiply first right so
multiply and division takes over

28
00:00:45,029 --> 00:00:45,039
multiply and division takes over
 

29
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,630
multiply and division takes over
priorities then

30
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:46,640
priorities then
 

31
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,869
priorities then
plus and minus yeah okay

32
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:48,879
plus and minus yeah okay
 

33
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,229
plus and minus yeah okay
correct

34
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:50,239
correct
 

35
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,069
correct
okay now how about if i want to do this

36
00:00:52,069 --> 00:00:52,079
okay now how about if i want to do this
 

37
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,110
okay now how about if i want to do this
three plus two times four

38
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:57,120

 

39
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,310

okay so we so this reverse polish

40
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:00,320
okay so we so this reverse polish
 

41
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,630
okay so we so this reverse polish
notation is basically

42
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:02,640
notation is basically
 

43
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,030
notation is basically
uh the purpose of is to get rid of the

44
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:05,040
uh the purpose of is to get rid of the
 

45
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,070
uh the purpose of is to get rid of the
brackets

46
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:06,080
brackets
 

47
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,590
brackets
yeah because we are in look we are

48
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:07,600
yeah because we are in look we are
 

49
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,590
yeah because we are in look we are
introducing the brackets to check that

50
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:09,600
introducing the brackets to check that
 

51
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,149
introducing the brackets to check that
isn't any times

52
00:01:12,149 --> 00:01:12,159
isn't any times
 

53
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,510
isn't any times
that's right i'm talking about these two

54
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:13,520
that's right i'm talking about these two
 

55
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,590
that's right i'm talking about these two
examples so

56
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:15,600
examples so
 

57
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,310
examples so
three plus two times yes so look we we

58
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:18,320
three plus two times yes so look we we
 

59
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,789
three plus two times yes so look we we
are introducing the parentheses to

60
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:20,799
are introducing the parentheses to
 

61
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,789
are introducing the parentheses to
change the order right sit down sit down

62
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:22,799
change the order right sit down sit down
 

63
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,230
change the order right sit down sit down
please yeah

64
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:24,240
please yeah
 

65
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,310
please yeah
so we don't want that right so this

66
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:26,320
so we don't want that right so this
 

67
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,590
so we don't want that right so this
reverse polish notation is is

68
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:29,600
reverse polish notation is is
 

69
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,149
reverse polish notation is is
you know the purpose of is to get rid of

70
00:01:32,149 --> 00:01:32,159
you know the purpose of is to get rid of
 

71
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,230
you know the purpose of is to get rid of
parentheses and then can

72
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:34,240
parentheses and then can
 

73
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,149
parentheses and then can
can be used to express these two

74
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:36,159
can be used to express these two
 

75
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,550
can be used to express these two
situations okay so how can we do this

76
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:38,560
situations okay so how can we do this
 

77
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:51,670
situations okay so how can we do this
okay so for

78
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:51,680

 

79
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,030

is

80
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:53,040
is
 

81
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,350
is
it's the other people from poland yeah

82
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:55,360
it's the other people from poland yeah
 

83
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,350
it's the other people from poland yeah
another polish the country oh i thought

84
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:57,360
another polish the country oh i thought
 

85
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,590
another polish the country oh i thought
you mean like i'm really rich or

86
00:01:59,590 --> 00:01:59,600
you mean like i'm really rich or
 

87
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,550
you mean like i'm really rich or
something like making stuff clean

88
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:02,560
something like making stuff clean
 

89
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,030
something like making stuff clean
like this notation was invented by

90
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:05,040
like this notation was invented by
 

91
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,670
like this notation was invented by
by some polish scientists okay can you

92
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:07,680
by some polish scientists okay can you
 

93
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,510
by some polish scientists okay can you
sit down please not just jumping around

94
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:09,520
sit down please not just jumping around
 

95
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,070
sit down please not just jumping around
okay look so this one

96
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:12,080
okay look so this one
 

97
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,070
okay look so this one
so it'll be two three

98
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:14,080
so it'll be two three
 

99
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,350
so it'll be two three
two

100
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:15,360
two
 

101
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,750
two
okay so you'll be two four

102
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:17,760
okay so you'll be two four
 

103
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,710
okay so you'll be two four
times plus okay and then this one will

104
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:20,720
times plus okay and then this one will
 

105
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,949
times plus okay and then this one will
be one

106
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:22,959
be one
 

107
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,710
be one
three two

108
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:24,720
three two
 

109
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,869
three two
plus

110
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:26,879
plus
 

111
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:27,910
plus
four

112
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:27,920
four
 

113
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,309
four
ten okay

114
00:02:30,309 --> 00:02:30,319
ten okay
 

115
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,949
ten okay
so do you see how this is working

116
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:32,959
so do you see how this is working
 

117
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,869
so do you see how this is working
so look these two

118
00:02:34,869 --> 00:02:34,879
so look these two
 

119
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,190
so look these two
these will be converted to rpm like that

120
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:37,200
these will be converted to rpm like that
 

121
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,830
these will be converted to rpm like that
at least converted by rpm okay can you

122
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:39,840
at least converted by rpm okay can you
 

123
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,390
at least converted by rpm okay can you
can you imagine how how we're going to

124
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:42,400
can you imagine how how we're going to
 

125
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,710
can you imagine how how we're going to
how we're going to evaluate this

126
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:44,720
how we're going to evaluate this
 

127
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,990
how we're going to evaluate this
at least

128
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:48,000

 

129
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,270

don't be saying same characters yeah

130
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:51,280
don't be saying same characters yeah
 

131
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,990
don't be saying same characters yeah
yeah so this is this one exactly this is

132
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:54,000
yeah so this is this one exactly this is
 

133
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,830
yeah so this is this one exactly this is
two so yeah but it doesn't have any

134
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:55,840
two so yeah but it doesn't have any
 

135
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,350
two so yeah but it doesn't have any
parentheses

136
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:57,360
parentheses
 

137
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,750
parentheses
which is which but we don't we don't

138
00:02:59,750 --> 00:02:59,760
which is which but we don't we don't
 

139
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,750
which is which but we don't we don't
need that's the beauty of reverse so

140
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:01,760
need that's the beauty of reverse so
 

141
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,830
need that's the beauty of reverse so
what's diverse

142
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:05,840

 

143
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,869

yeah

144
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:06,879
yeah
 

145
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,190
yeah
but look so every time we we have this

146
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:09,200
but look so every time we we have this
 

147
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,229
but look so every time we we have this
operation

148
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:10,239
operation
 

149
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,869
operation
yeah we take the previous two

150
00:03:12,869 --> 00:03:12,879
yeah we take the previous two
 

151
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,550
yeah we take the previous two
add it

152
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:14,560
add it
 

153
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,630
add it
so two times four

154
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:16,640
so two times four
 

155
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,830
so two times four
eight yeah don't we we

156
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:19,840
eight yeah don't we we
 

157
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,910
eight yeah don't we we
changed it to eight okay and we'll keep

158
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:21,920
changed it to eight okay and we'll keep
 

159
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,350
changed it to eight okay and we'll keep
going plus

160
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:23,360
going plus
 

161
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,030
going plus
we take the previous two

162
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,040
we take the previous two
 

163
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,869
we take the previous two
three plus eight you know how about this

164
00:03:26,869 --> 00:03:26,879
three plus eight you know how about this
 

165
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,830
three plus eight you know how about this
one three two okay operation

166
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:29,840
one three two okay operation
 

167
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,390
one three two okay operation
so what do we need to do yeah take the

168
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:32,400
so what do we need to do yeah take the
 

169
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,309
so what do we need to do yeah take the
previous two three plus two five five

170
00:03:36,309 --> 00:03:36,319
previous two three plus two five five
 

171
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,070
previous two three plus two five five
representatives

172
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:38,080
representatives
 

173
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,070
representatives
okay look at five and four

174
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:40,080
okay look at five and four
 

175
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,270
okay look at five and four
times thing

176
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:41,280
times thing
 

177
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,670
times thing
now we take the previous two look five

178
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:43,680
now we take the previous two look five
 

179
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,350
now we take the previous two look five
twenty

180
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:45,360
twenty
 

181
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,390
twenty
do you see it do you see how this works

182
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:48,400
do you see it do you see how this works
 

183
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,869
do you see it do you see how this works
yeah but i don't get it why did you do

184
00:03:50,869 --> 00:03:50,879
yeah but i don't get it why did you do
 

185
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,869
yeah but i don't get it why did you do
this one the times but then this on the

186
00:03:52,869 --> 00:03:52,879
this one the times but then this on the
 

187
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,110
this one the times but then this on the
plus first

188
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:55,120
plus first
 

189
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,110
plus first
uh i just show you what what do you mean

190
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:57,120
uh i just show you what what do you mean
 

191
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,830
uh i just show you what what do you mean
you don't understand

192
00:03:59,830 --> 00:03:59,840
you don't understand
 

193
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,789
you don't understand
why do you do the times first on this

194
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:02,799
why do you do the times first on this
 

195
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,190
why do you do the times first on this
one no no no from the left to right when

196
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:05,200
one no no no from the left to right when
 

197
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,789
one no no no from the left to right when
we meet the operation we take the

198
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:06,799
we meet the operation we take the
 

199
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,630
we meet the operation we take the
previous two that defines that look yeah

200
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:08,640
previous two that defines that look yeah
 

201
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,910
previous two that defines that look yeah
but when we start here there was a time

202
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:11,920
but when we start here there was a time
 

203
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,429
but when we start here there was a time
yeah okay so look at this one okay look

204
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:13,439
yeah okay so look at this one okay look
 

205
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,710
yeah okay so look at this one okay look
look

206
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:14,720
look
 

207
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,909
look
three two plus four times

208
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:17,919
three two plus four times
 

209
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:19,270
three two plus four times
right

210
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:19,280
right
 

211
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,949
right
so you say why why we don't take this

212
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:20,959
so you say why why we don't take this
 

213
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,310
so you say why why we don't take this
one right yeah

214
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:22,320
one right yeah
 

215
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,030
one right yeah
because look we meet we we scan from

216
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:25,040
because look we meet we we scan from
 

217
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,189
because look we meet we we scan from
left to right the first operator we see

218
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:27,199
left to right the first operator we see
 

219
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,950
left to right the first operator we see
is plus

220
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:28,960
is plus
 

221
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,629
is plus
so what does it mean

222
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:30,639
so what does it mean
 

223
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,390
so what does it mean
we take the previous two

224
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:34,400

 

225
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,390

and we press it

226
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:36,400
and we press it
 

227
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,070
and we press it
so we keep going

228
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,080
so we keep going
 

229
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,629
so we keep going
we take the previous two so this c the

230
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:40,639
we take the previous two so this c the
 

231
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,670
we take the previous two so this c the
reverse

232
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:41,680
reverse
 

233
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,230
reverse
notation already defines the order

234
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:44,240
notation already defines the order
 

235
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,189
notation already defines the order
got it

236
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:45,199
got it
 

237
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,430
got it
oh yeah makes sense okay so i'm going to

238
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:49,440
oh yeah makes sense okay so i'm going to
 

239
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,590
oh yeah makes sense okay so i'm going to
write another one okay so can you can

240
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:51,600
write another one okay so can you can
 

241
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,710
write another one okay so can you can
you

242
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:52,720
you
 

243
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,030
you
convert it to reverse polish notation

244
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:55,040
convert it to reverse polish notation
 

245
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,189
convert it to reverse polish notation
okay one plus two plus three easy and

246
00:04:57,189 --> 00:04:57,199
okay one plus two plus three easy and
 

247
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,390
okay one plus two plus three easy and
one plus two times three

248
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:00,400
one plus two times three
 

249
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,550
one plus two times three
yeah okay so for this one

250
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:02,560
yeah okay so for this one
 

251
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,110
yeah okay so for this one
that's six i know so how can you how can

252
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:05,120
that's six i know so how can you how can
 

253
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,909
that's six i know so how can you how can
we

254
00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:05,919
we
 

255
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:21,029
we
convert it to reverse polish notation

256
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:21,039

 

257
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,070

there are two operators we only have one

258
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,080
there are two operators we only have one
 

259
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,550
there are two operators we only have one
plus yeah okay so what is it one two

260
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:26,560
plus yeah okay so what is it one two
 

261
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,189
plus yeah okay so what is it one two
okay we have plus what does it mean we

262
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:29,199
okay we have plus what does it mean we
 

263
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,670
okay we have plus what does it mean we
take the previous two one mistake

264
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:31,680
take the previous two one mistake
 

265
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,990
take the previous two one mistake
so look one two three so it's like that

266
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:34,000
so look one two three so it's like that
 

267
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,189
so look one two three so it's like that
okay

268
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:35,199
okay
 

269
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,230
okay
one

270
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:36,240
one
 

271
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,270
one
two

272
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:37,280
two
 

273
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,870
two
plus three plus

274
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:40,880
plus three plus
 

275
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,749
plus three plus
okay

276
00:05:41,749 --> 00:05:41,759
okay
 

277
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,550
okay
so

278
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:42,560
so
 

279
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,070
so
so

280
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:44,080
so
 

281
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,230
so
it's better if you reverse it yeah look

282
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:46,240
it's better if you reverse it yeah look
 

283
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,629
it's better if you reverse it yeah look
at this is reversing look because

284
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:48,639
at this is reversing look because
 

285
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,830
at this is reversing look because
reversing

286
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:49,840
reversing
 

287
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,629
reversing
so plus we take the two and take the one

288
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:52,639
so plus we take the two and take the one
 

289
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,990
so plus we take the two and take the one
and then we add it together will be

290
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:54,000
and then we add it together will be
 

291
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,150
and then we add it together will be
three and then we keep going

292
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:56,160
three and then we keep going
 

293
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,350
three and then we keep going
keep going three and uh

294
00:05:59,350 --> 00:05:59,360
keep going three and uh
 

295
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,270
keep going three and uh
and two and three right because three

296
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:01,280
and two and three right because three
 

297
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,029
and two and three right because three
and then plus

298
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:03,039
and then plus
 

299
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,710
and then plus
we take the previous two okay and how

300
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:04,720
we take the previous two okay and how
 

301
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,550
we take the previous two okay and how
about this one

302
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:06,560
about this one
 

303
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,990
about this one
one

304
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:08,000
one
 

305
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,350
one
is one

306
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:09,360
is one
 

307
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,749
is one
yeah one and then

308
00:06:11,749 --> 00:06:11,759
yeah one and then
 

309
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,950
yeah one and then
why one

310
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:14,960

 

311
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,390

one

312
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:16,400
one
 

313
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,749
one
but we want to catch it at least two

314
00:06:17,749 --> 00:06:17,759
but we want to catch it at least two
 

315
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:24,550
but we want to catch it at least two
first yeah

316
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:24,560

 

317
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,749

okay two three times and then one plus

318
00:06:27,749 --> 00:06:27,759
okay two three times and then one plus
 

319
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:28,469
okay two three times and then one plus
one

320
00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:28,479
one
 

321
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,950
one
so where's where's one where is where do

322
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:30,960
so where's where's one where is where do
 

323
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,629
so where's where's one where is where do
we put the one where to pull up

324
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:34,639
we put the one where to pull up
 

325
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,629
we put the one where to pull up
if you do the one here that will become

326
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:36,639
if you do the one here that will become
 

327
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,790
if you do the one here that will become
two times three plus one but what we

328
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:38,800
two times three plus one but what we
 

329
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,350
two times three plus one but what we
want is one plus two times three

330
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:41,360
want is one plus two times three
 

331
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,029
want is one plus two times three
so what do we do

332
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:43,039
so what do we do
 

333
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,510
so what do we do
one plus

334
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:45,520
one plus
 

335
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,110
one plus
make sense

336
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:47,120
make sense
 

337
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,629
make sense
look two three

338
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:48,639
look two three
 

339
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,550
look two three
multiply

340
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:50,560
multiply
 

341
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,710
multiply
we change it to six

342
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:52,720
we change it to six
 

343
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,830
we change it to six
one six plus

344
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:55,840

 

345
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,629

seven yeah you see okay

346
00:06:58,629 --> 00:06:58,639
seven yeah you see okay
 

347
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,350
seven yeah you see okay
so so given this given is the first one

348
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:01,360
so so given this given is the first one
 

349
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,469
so so given this given is the first one
okay so

350
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:02,479
okay so
 

351
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,629
okay so
the problem today is easier it's not

352
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:04,639
the problem today is easier it's not
 

353
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,870
the problem today is easier it's not
asking to convert a mathematic

354
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:06,880
asking to convert a mathematic
 

355
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,589
asking to convert a mathematic
expression to a reverse polish

356
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:09,599
expression to a reverse polish
 

357
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,390
expression to a reverse polish
notation but instead we are already

358
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:12,400
notation but instead we are already
 

359
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,390
notation but instead we are already
given a rpn right

360
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:14,400
given a rpn right
 

361
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,390
given a rpn right
it's already valid and we just want to

362
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:16,400
it's already valid and we just want to
 

363
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,230
it's already valid and we just want to
evaluate the values of it

364
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:18,240
evaluate the values of it
 

365
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,469
evaluate the values of it
evaluate the expression

366
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:20,479
evaluate the expression
 

367
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,629
evaluate the expression
rpm right

368
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:22,639
rpm right
 

369
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,749
rpm right
so

370
00:07:23,749 --> 00:07:23,759
so
 

371
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,070
so
how how do we do it

372
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,080
how how do we do it
 

373
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:36,070
how how do we do it
how do we do it um

374
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:36,080

 

375
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,870

we given this one two plus

376
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:38,880
we given this one two plus
 

377
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,830
we given this one two plus
three times okay so how how this is the

378
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:41,840
three times okay so how how this is the
 

379
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,710
three times okay so how how this is the
uh okay that's this is array okay array

380
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:44,720
uh okay that's this is array okay array
 

381
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,790
uh okay that's this is array okay array
of expression expression equals that

382
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:46,800
of expression expression equals that
 

383
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,990
of expression expression equals that
yeah

384
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:48,000
yeah
 

385
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,710
yeah
three two yeah and an operation okay

386
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:52,720
three two yeah and an operation okay
 

387
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,270
three two yeah and an operation okay
so how do we evaluate

388
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:55,280
so how do we evaluate
 

389
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,830
so how do we evaluate
so we go to the beginning

390
00:07:59,830 --> 00:07:59,840

okay this is numbers that's fine if it's
number we push it

396
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:09,360
number we push it
 

397
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,830
number we push it
to a stack remember what

to a stack remember what
 

399
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,350
to a stack remember what
what's that um

400
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:15,360

 

401
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,510

what's the stack first thing

402
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:17,520
what's the stack first thing
 

403
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,110
what's the stack first thing
first no

404

look stack all right look we put that
 

409
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,990
look stack all right look we put that
when we have numbers we put it in the

410
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:26,000
when we have numbers we put it in the
 

411
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,189
when we have numbers we put it in the
stack right

one
 

417
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,469
one
two oh now we have the operator with no

418
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:32,479
two oh now we have the operator with no
 

419
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,070

numbers
 

421
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,350
numbers
now what do we do

422
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:35,360
now what do we do
 

423
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,190
now what do we do
we take two numbers

424
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:37,200
we take two numbers
 

425
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,110
we take two numbers
out of the stack yeah

426
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:39,120
out of the stack yeah
 

427
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,389
out of the stack yeah
and what do we do

428
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:40,399
and what do we do
 

429
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,790
and what do we do
based on the appraiser we can do this

430
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:42,800
based on the appraiser we can do this
 

431
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,030
based on the appraiser we can do this
operation right so plus

432
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,040
operation right so plus
 

433
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,590
operation right so plus
so let's put a three here right yeah

434
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:47,600
so let's put a three here right yeah
 

435
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,470

three before so it's nine so we take two
 

443
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,990
three before so it's nine so we take two
numbers out yeah and then we do the

444
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:58,000
numbers out yeah and then we do the
 

445
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,590
numbers out yeah and then we do the
operation yeah and then put it put the

446
00:08:59,590 --> 00:08:59,600
operation yeah and then put it put the
 

447
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,750
operation yeah and then put it put the
put it back nine

448
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:01,760
put it back nine
 

449
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,750
put it back nine
okay the last yeah that's what i said

450
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:03,760
okay the last yeah that's what i said
 

451
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,990
okay the last yeah that's what i said
okay so the value will be what the value

452
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:06,000
okay so the value will be what the value
 

453
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:15,990

so
 

465
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,470
so
we will have a stack answer let's put an

466
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:38,480
we will have a stack answer let's put an
 

467
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,190
we will have a stack answer let's put an
answer let's put a stack okay stack

468
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:41,200
answer let's put a stack okay stack
 

469
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,790
answer let's put a stack okay stack
equals how do we define a stack in in

470
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:44,800
equals how do we define a stack in in
 

471
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,190
equals how do we define a stack in in
in person how do we define a step

472
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:47,200
in person how do we define a step
 

473
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,790
in person how do we define a step
well we

474
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:48,800
well we
 

475
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,550
well we
um

476
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:50,560
um
 

477
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,750
um
how do we define define the step

478
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:53,760
how do we define define the step
 

479
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,150
how do we define define the step
how do we define the stack

480
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:56,160
how do we define the stack
 

481
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:01,430
how do we define the stack
how do we define our space list

482
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:01,440

 

483
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,710

okay then

484
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:02,720
okay then
 

485
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,670
okay then
okay so let's say for

486
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:05,680
okay so let's say for
 

487
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,949
okay so let's say for
e

488
00:10:06,949 --> 00:10:06,959
e
 

489
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:07,910
e
in

490
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:07,920
in
 

491
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,350
in
a r okay

492
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:09,360
a r okay
 

493
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,710
a r okay
yeah

494
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:10,720
yeah
 

495
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,829
yeah
okay

496
00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:11,839
okay
 

497
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,990
okay
so look first of all we want to define

498
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:14,000
so look first of all we want to define
 

499
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,069
so look first of all we want to define
the list of operations we can put it in

500
00:10:16,069 --> 00:10:16,079
the list of operations we can put it in
 

501
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,470
the list of operations we can put it in
a dictionary right so so let's say i

502
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:18,480
a dictionary right so so let's say i
 

503
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,550
a dictionary right so so let's say i
look at operation supporting operation

504
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:20,560
look at operation supporting operation
 

505
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,550
look at operation supporting operation
equals one curry breaks

506
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:22,560
equals one curry breaks
 

507
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,710
equals one curry breaks
look at me cut it break and then we can

508
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:24,720
look at me cut it break and then we can
 

509
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,630
look at me cut it break and then we can
say add so these right add

510
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:28,640
say add so these right add
 

511
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,150
say add so these right add
minus

512
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:30,160
minus
 

513
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,990
minus
the subtract

514
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:32,000
the subtract
 

515
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,750
the subtract
times

516
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:33,760
times
 

517
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,350
times
division all right

518
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:35,360
division all right
 

519
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,509
division all right
so this n so we want to define the n key

520
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:39,519
so this n so we want to define the n key
 

521
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,550
so this n so we want to define the n key
the keys are operations right

522
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:42,560
the keys are operations right
 

523
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,030
the keys are operations right
and the values are the actual operation

524
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,040
and the values are the actual operation
 

525
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,710
and the values are the actual operation
function which we can define as lambda

526
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:46,720
function which we can define as lambda
 

527
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,430
function which we can define as lambda
which is what is a short function okay

528
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:49,440
which is what is a short function okay
 

529
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,150
which is what is a short function okay
so we can do this

530
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:54,160

 

531
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,230

okay i don't know how to spell lambda

532
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:56,240
okay i don't know how to spell lambda
 

533
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,389
okay i don't know how to spell lambda
a b

534
00:10:58,389 --> 00:10:58,399
a b
 

535
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:22,160
a b
okay that's fine

536
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:22,170

 

537
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:37,990

[Music]

538
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:38,000

 

539
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,910

function takes two parameters and then

540
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:39,920
function takes two parameters and then
 

541
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,949
function takes two parameters and then
you which you will use a column

542
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:42,959
you which you will use a column
 

543
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,509
you which you will use a column
to define what it does so which is a

544
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:45,519
to define what it does so which is a
 

545
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,310
to define what it does so which is a
minus b okay so look at a b

546
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:48,320
minus b okay so look at a b
 

547
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:55,670
minus b okay so look at a b
what what do we put here a times b

548
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:55,680

 

549
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,790

yeah

550
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:56,800
yeah
 

551
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,069
yeah
a b

552
00:11:58,069 --> 00:11:58,079
a b
 

553
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,030
a b
a

554
00:11:59,030 --> 00:11:59,040
a
 

555
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,509
a
divided by b okay if we only keep the

556
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:01,519
divided by b okay if we only keep the
 

557
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,790
divided by b okay if we only keep the
integer okay yeah so look this operation

558
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:04,800
integer okay yeah so look this operation
 

559
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,870
integer okay yeah so look this operation
will be traditionally the keys will be

560
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:06,880
will be traditionally the keys will be
 

561
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,590
will be traditionally the keys will be
the operators we support it which we can

562
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:09,600
the operators we support it which we can
 

563
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,190
the operators we support it which we can
define more we can extend this so far

564
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:13,200
define more we can extend this so far
 

565
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,310
define more we can extend this so far
okay so we only support four plus

566
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:16,320
okay so we only support four plus
 

567
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,190
okay so we only support four plus
subtract multiply and divide what if

568
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:19,200
subtract multiply and divide what if
 

569
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,470
subtract multiply and divide what if
there was a divide and i think the y is

570
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:22,480
there was a divide and i think the y is
 

571
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,670
there was a divide and i think the y is
harder

572
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:23,680
harder
 

573
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,230
harder
yeah it's the same look it's the same

574
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:26,240
yeah it's the same look it's the same
 

575
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,470
yeah it's the same look it's the same
because we divide it by two

576
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:28,480
because we divide it by two
 

577
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,750
because we divide it by two
yeah

578
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:29,760
yeah
 

579
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,150
yeah
sorry why if you can't divide equals

580
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:32,160
sorry why if you can't divide equals
 

581
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,230
sorry why if you can't divide equals
that's why we use the integer

582
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:34,240
that's why we use the integer
 

583
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,310
that's why we use the integer
that's why we have this

584
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:36,320
that's why we have this
 

585
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,990
that's why we have this
integer okay yeah

586
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:40,000

 

587
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,150

now we have these operators okay the

588
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:42,160
now we have these operators okay the
 

589
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,870
now we have these operators okay the
keys are the operators

590
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:44,880
keys are the operators
 

591
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,629
keys are the operators
the values are the

592
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:46,639
the values are the
 

593
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,870
the values are the
corresponding lambda function lambda is

594
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:48,880
corresponding lambda function lambda is
 

595
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,509
corresponding lambda function lambda is
a short function yes the function

596
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:51,519
a short function yes the function
 

597
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,910
a short function yes the function
now for e look then we say

598
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:53,920
now for e look then we say
 

599
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,949
now for e look then we say
if e

600
00:12:54,949 --> 00:12:54,959
if e
 

601
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:59,910
if e
in operators what does it mean

602
00:12:59,910 --> 00:12:59,920

 

603
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,069

if e in operators now we need to take

604
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:02,079
if e in operators now we need to take
 

605
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,710
if e in operators now we need to take
two numbers right yeah okay so number

606
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:04,720
two numbers right yeah okay so number
 

607
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,670
two numbers right yeah okay so number
one num num one num two okay so first of

608
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:07,680
one num num one num two okay so first of
 

609
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,910
one num num one num two okay so first of
all we take the number two first okay

610
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:09,920
all we take the number two first okay
 

611
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,470
all we take the number two first okay
num two equals

612
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:12,480
num two equals
 

613
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,110
num two equals
st dot pop

614
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:15,120
st dot pop
 

615
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,150
st dot pop
and num one equals st dot pop right so

616
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:18,160
and num one equals st dot pop right so
 

617
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,110
and num one equals st dot pop right so
we have two numbers so what

618
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:21,120
we have two numbers so what
 

619
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,269
we have two numbers so what
what should we do then we can say we

620
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:23,279
what should we do then we can say we
 

621
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:28,230
what should we do then we can say we
push the value back st append

622
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:28,240

 

623
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,550

up the operators yeah operators

624
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:30,560
up the operators yeah operators
 

625
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,150
up the operators yeah operators

operators e
 

629
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,670
operators e
this is a function and we take that n

630
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:37,680
this is a function and we take that n
 

631
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,350
this is a function and we take that n
one and two yeah

632
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:39,360
one and two yeah
 

633
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,750
one and two yeah
okay so this is look

634
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:41,760
okay so this is look
 

635
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,389
okay so this is look
okay look at me operator's e is the

636
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:44,399
okay look at me operator's e is the
 

637
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,389
okay look at me operator's e is the
lambda function right the key is the

638
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:46,399
lambda function right the key is the
 

639
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,269
lambda function right the key is the
operator lambda operators e is the

640
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:49,279
operator lambda operators e is the
 

641
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,550
operator lambda operators e is the
lambda function and then we can call it

642
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:52,560
lambda function and then we can call it
 

643
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,189
lambda function and then we can call it
giving it two parameters n one and n two

644
00:13:55,189 --> 00:13:55,199
giving it two parameters n one and n two
 

645
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,189
giving it two parameters n one and n two
because the first the first number we

646
00:13:57,189 --> 00:13:57,199
because the first the first number we
 

647
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,910
because the first the first number we
take it from the stack is the second

648
00:13:59,910 --> 00:13:59,920
take it from the stack is the second
 

649
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,790
take it from the stack is the second
the one plus three the first the first

650
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:02,800
the one plus three the first the first
 

651
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,150
the one plus three the first the first

652
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:04,160
step
 

653
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,310
step
when we push it into the stack is one

654
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:06,320
when we push it into the stack is one
 

655
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,230
when we push it into the stack is one
and three the first number we take is

656
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:08,240
and three the first number we take is
 

657
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,150
and three the first number we take is
three is the second number and two the

658
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:10,160
three is the second number and two the
 

659
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,110
three is the second number and two the
second

660
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:11,120
second
 

661
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,710
second
second time we take it is the first

662
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:12,720
second time we take it is the first
 

663
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,030
second time we take it is the first
number so look we're calling this number

664
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:15,040
number so look we're calling this number
 

665
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,790
number so look we're calling this number
function and giving it two parameters

666
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:16,800
function and giving it two parameters
 

667
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,670
function and giving it two parameters
and one and two okay let's see

668
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:19,680
and one and two okay let's see
 

669
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,670
and one and two okay let's see
look as what

670
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:21,680
look as what
 

671
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,110
look as what
yes e is a number so we're just pushing

672
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:25,120
yes e is a number so we're just pushing
 

673
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,509
yes e is a number so we're just pushing
it to the stack right so st dot append

674
00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:27,519
it to the stack right so st dot append
 

675
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:33,970
it to the stack right so st dot append
whatever

676
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:33,980

that's st is now has one number how we
 

685
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,550
that's st is now has one number how we
can get the line

very sty

700
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:35,279

ft
 

703
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:43,749
ft
which number is that value which number

704
00:15:43,749 --> 00:15:43,759

 

705
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,350

the first number will be the top of the

706
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:45,360
the first number will be the top of the
 

707
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,870
the first number will be the top of the
stack right because it's only one number

708
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:46,880
stack right because it's only one number
 

709
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,670
stack right because it's only one number
okay actually it's not the top of it's

710
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:49,680
okay actually it's not the top of it's
 

711
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,509
okay actually it's not the top of it's
no no actually it's not zero it's minus

712
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:51,519
no no actually it's not zero it's minus
 

713
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,430
no no actually it's not zero it's minus
one because we are returning the

714
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:53,440
one because we are returning the
 

715
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,910
one because we are returning the
the last one right the last one right

716
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:55,920
the last one right the last one right
 

717
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,470
the last one right the last one right
correct

718
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:58,480

 

719
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,670

here

720
00:15:59,670 --> 00:15:59,680
here
 

721
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,870
here
here 60 minimum is the same as st minus

722
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:02,880
here 60 minimum is the same as st minus
 

723
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,269
here 60 minimum is the same as st minus
one but the meaning is different right

724
00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:05,279
one but the meaning is different right
 

725
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,790
one but the meaning is different right
the minor the thing the meaning is

726
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:06,800
the minor the thing the meaning is
 

727
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,509
the minor the thing the meaning is
different st minor one what does mean is

728
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:09,519
different st minor one what does mean is
 

729
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,509
different st minor one what does mean is
the top of the stack right so that's the

730
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:11,519
the top of the stack right so that's the
 

731
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,829
the top of the stack right so that's the
one that's the one we want we want to

732
00:16:13,829 --> 00:16:13,839
one that's the one we want we want to
 

733
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,509
one that's the one we want we want to
retrieve the value of

734
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:15,519
retrieve the value of
 

735
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,949
retrieve the value of
okay so can you tell me the difference s

736
00:16:16,949 --> 00:16:16,959
okay so can you tell me the difference s
 

737
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,590
okay so can you tell me the difference s
t dot probably that's t minus one

738
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:19,600
t dot probably that's t minus one
 

739
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,430
t dot probably that's t minus one
if you have this and then you just pop

740
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:21,440
if you have this and then you just pop
 

741
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,350
if you have this and then you just pop
it it's just gone you just go and return

742
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:23,360
it it's just gone you just go and return
 

743
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,269
it it's just gone you just go and return
knight right but it's this one

744
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:27,279

 

745
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,509

but what happened to the stack

746
00:16:31,509 --> 00:16:31,519

 

747
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,590

does it change no that's that's the

748
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:33,600
does it change no that's that's the
 

749
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,430
does it change no that's that's the
difference okay so this one we just

750
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:35,440
difference okay so this one we just
 

751
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,910
difference okay so this one we just
retrieve it you're gonna peek what's

752
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:37,920
retrieve it you're gonna peek what's
 

753
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,550
retrieve it you're gonna peek what's
this meaning pink pink and pop what's

754
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:40,560
this meaning pink pink and pop what's
 

755
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,710
this meaning pink pink and pop what's

00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:49,120
like you pick you just peek by you you
 

761
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,949
like you pick you just peek by you you
pick you know the value of the top is

762
00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:50,959
pick you know the value of the top is
 

763
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,310
pick you know the value of the top is
nice but you don't change it you don't

764
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:52,320
nice but you don't change it you don't
 

765
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,150

00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,710
what the difference
what's the time complexity

772
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:00,720
what's the time complexity
