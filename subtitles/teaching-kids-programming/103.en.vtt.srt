1
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,230

in each integer in the binary right for

2
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:16,240
in each integer in the binary right for
 

3
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,950
in each integer in the binary right for
example 15 in binary what's that

4
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:18,960
example 15 in binary what's that
 

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,990
example 15 in binary what's that
1 1 1 1

6
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:22,000
1 1 1 1
 

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,429
1 1 1 1
1 1 1 yeah yeah how about

8
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:25,439
1 1 1 yeah yeah how about
 

9
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:33,590
1 1 1 yeah yeah how about
8 in binary

10
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:33,600

 

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,709

yes so so basically we count one one

12
00:00:36,709 --> 00:00:36,719
yes so so basically we count one one
 

13
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,069
yes so so basically we count one one
there will be four and there will be one

14
00:00:38,069 --> 00:00:38,079
there will be four and there will be one
 

15
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,190
there will be four and there will be one
yeah

16
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:39,200
yeah
 

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,590
yeah
yeah okay do you still remember how

18
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:43,600
yeah okay do you still remember how
 

19
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,950
yeah okay do you still remember how
come here

20
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:46,960

 

21
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,310

define count 1

22
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:50,320
define count 1
 

23
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,029
define count 1
10 yeah do you still remember how to

24
00:00:53,029 --> 00:00:53,039
10 yeah do you still remember how to
 

25
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,069
10 yeah do you still remember how to
recall

26
00:00:54,069 --> 00:00:54,079
recall
 

27
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,670
recall
it one one one easiest way would be use

28
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:57,680
it one one one easiest way would be use
 

29
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:57,990
it one one one easiest way would be use
the

30
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:58,000
the
 

31
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,270
the
uh python function called bin bin

32
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:01,280
uh python function called bin bin
 

33
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,630
uh python function called bin bin
yeah bin is short for binary not for the

34
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:04,640
yeah bin is short for binary not for the
 

35
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,750
yeah bin is short for binary not for the
rubbish bin okay binary yeah so what it

36
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:07,760
rubbish bin okay binary yeah so what it
 

37
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,030
rubbish bin okay binary yeah so what it
takes it takes the number

38
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:09,040
takes it takes the number
 

39
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,070
takes it takes the number
15 number yeah then you will give

40
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:12,080
15 number yeah then you will give
 

41
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,670
15 number yeah then you will give
this will give a string look it has two

42
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:15,680
this will give a string look it has two
 

43
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,910
this will give a string look it has two
two extra bits zero zero binary and then

44
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:19,920
two extra bits zero zero binary and then
 

45
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,670
two extra bits zero zero binary and then
one one one one so basically you

46
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:21,680
one one one one so basically you
 

47
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,950
one one one one so basically you
have prefix the actual binaries with

48
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:24,960
have prefix the actual binaries with
 

49
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,469
have prefix the actual binaries with
zero bit okay so and then we can count b

50
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:28,479
zero bit okay so and then we can count b
 

51
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,590
zero bit okay so and then we can count b
how can we do this we can first of all

52
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:31,600
how can we do this we can first of all
 

53
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,469
how can we do this we can first of all
convert this n yeah yeah but we don't

54
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:34,479
convert this n yeah yeah but we don't
 

55
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:34,950
convert this n yeah yeah but we don't
want this

56
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:34,960
want this
 

57
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,990
want this
number two yeah these two yeah

58
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:38,000
number two yeah these two yeah
 

59
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,030
number two yeah these two yeah
yeah we can just do this

60
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,040
yeah we can just do this
 

61
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,469
yeah we can just do this
two then you'll get rid of this oh

62
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:44,479
two then you'll get rid of this oh
 

63
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,069
two then you'll get rid of this oh
we don't need to get rid of it and then

64
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:46,079
we don't need to get rid of it and then
 

65
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,910
we don't need to get rid of it and then
we after that we do what

66
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:47,920
we after that we do what
 

67
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,830
we after that we do what
count one okay

68
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:51,840
count one okay
 

69
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,429
count one okay
that's it yeah this is the remember yeah

70
00:01:55,429 --> 00:01:55,439
that's it yeah this is the remember yeah
 

71
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,670
that's it yeah this is the remember yeah
okay the last thing is knowledge that

72
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:57,680
okay the last thing is knowledge that
 

73
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,030
okay the last thing is knowledge that
looks pretty short

74
00:01:59,030 --> 00:01:59,040
looks pretty short
 

75
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,190
looks pretty short
yeah pretty soft so leave this

76
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:01,200
yeah pretty soft so leave this
 

77
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,709
yeah pretty soft so leave this
converting

78
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:02,719
converting
 

79
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,389
converting
numbers to binary yeah converting by

80
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:06,399
numbers to binary yeah converting by
 

81
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,589
numbers to binary yeah converting by
numbers to binary is log n right

82
00:02:09,589 --> 00:02:09,599
numbers to binary is log n right
 

83
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:12,949
numbers to binary is log n right
yes and then call again

84
00:02:12,949 --> 00:02:12,959
yes and then call again
 

85
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,070
yes and then call again
counting usually is o n but n

86
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:16,080
counting usually is o n but n
 

87
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,309
counting usually is o n but n
is is the number of bits but when you

88
00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:18,319
is is the number of bits but when you
 

89
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,070
is is the number of bits but when you
when you count it

90
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:20,080
when you count it
 

91
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,470
when you count it
convert it to binary the n is actually

92
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:22,480
convert it to binary the n is actually
 

93
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,110
convert it to binary the n is actually
login

94
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:23,120
login
 

95
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,150
login
so actually because number of

96
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,160
so actually because number of
 

97
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,670
so actually because number of
one is log n times log n

98
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:29,680
one is log n times log n
 

99
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,030
one is log n times log n
you're going to get it oh don't get it

100
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:33,040
you're going to get it oh don't get it
 

101
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,990
you're going to get it oh don't get it
because this

102
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:34,000
because this
 

103
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,750
because this
counting one in the number in the string

104
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:37,760
counting one in the number in the string
 

105
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,350
counting one in the number in the string
is o n right it's a n but this n

106
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:41,360
is o n right it's a n but this n
 

107
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,390
is o n right it's a n but this n
is the number of the bit number of the

108
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:44,400
is the number of the bit number of the
 

109
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,750
is the number of the bit number of the
bits

110
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:45,760
bits
 

111
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,110
bits
which is o n o log n in this case

112
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:49,120
which is o n o log n in this case
 

113
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,750
which is o n o log n in this case
yeah so actually it's all locked and

114
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:51,760
yeah so actually it's all locked and
 

115
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,790
yeah so actually it's all locked and
again okay

116
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:52,800
again okay
 

117
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,030
again okay
so so this is not the first time

118
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,040
so so this is not the first time
 

119
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,750
so so this is not the first time
yes yes okay so now we can do another

120
00:02:59,750 --> 00:02:59,760
yes yes okay so now we can do another
 

121
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,470
yes yes okay so now we can do another
one remember

122
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:00,480
one remember
 

123
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,790
one remember
define let's let's do another version

124
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:02,800
define let's let's do another version
 

125
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,830
define let's let's do another version
count two okay

126
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:05,840
count two okay
 

127
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,110
count two okay
look one one one one so every time

128
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:09,120
look one one one one so every time
 

129
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,990
look one one one one so every time
we turn two yeah look at every time we

130
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:12,000
we turn two yeah look at every time we
 

131
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,110
we turn two yeah look at every time we
can

132
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:13,120
can
 

133
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,149
can
every right every time we can

134
00:03:16,149 --> 00:03:16,159
every right every time we can
 

135
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,350
every right every time we can
count we can look at the last digit

136
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:19,360
count we can look at the last digit
 

137
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,670
count we can look at the last digit
yeah and if it's one i add it if it's

138
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:21,680
yeah and if it's one i add it if it's
 

139
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,270
yeah and if it's one i add it if it's
zero i add a zero

140
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:23,280
zero i add a zero
 

141
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,949
zero i add a zero
and then i get rid of it and then it

142
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:24,959
and then i get rid of it and then it
 

143
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,710
and then i get rid of it and then it
becomes three digit and then i look at

144
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:26,720
becomes three digit and then i look at
 

145
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,710
becomes three digit and then i look at
the last digit

146
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:28,720
the last digit
 

147
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,750
the last digit
least significant

148
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:31,760
least significant
 

149
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,789
least significant
bite okay fit so it's last digit and i

150
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:34,799
bite okay fit so it's last digit and i
 

151
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:35,589
bite okay fit so it's last digit and i
look at it

152
00:03:35,589 --> 00:03:35,599
look at it
 

153
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,229
look at it
i take away i look at it i think away so

154
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:38,239
i take away i look at it i think away so
 

155
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,149
i take away i look at it i think away so
we can do this

156
00:03:40,149 --> 00:03:40,159
we can do this
 

157
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,229
we can do this
look answer equals yellow

158
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:44,239
look answer equals yellow
 

159
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,750
look answer equals yellow
wire and bigger than zero

160
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:47,760

one what's the last bit
 

167
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,750
one what's the last bit
n1 in the last bit one yeah

168
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:01,760
n1 in the last bit one yeah
 

169
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,270
n1 in the last bit one yeah
do you still remember and then i want to

170
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:05,280
do you still remember and then i want to
 

171
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,589
do you still remember and then i want to
i want to remove the last bit how can we

172
00:04:07,589 --> 00:04:07,599
i want to remove the last bit how can we
 

173
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,190
i want to remove the last bit how can we
do it we can do this

174
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:09,200
do it we can do this
 

175
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,550
do it we can do this
shift shift to equals one yeah

176
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:12,560
shift shift to equals one yeah
 

177
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,629
shift shift to equals one yeah
or you can do this divided by two yeah

178
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:16,639
or you can do this divided by two yeah
 

179
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,749
or you can do this divided by two yeah
divided by two divided

180
00:04:19,749 --> 00:04:19,759
divided by two divided
 

181
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,790
divided by two divided
equals two okay it's the same thing yeah

182
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:22,800
equals two okay it's the same thing yeah
 

183
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,710
equals two okay it's the same thing yeah
this divided by two the integer part

184
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:26,720
this divided by two the integer part
 

185
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,749
this divided by two the integer part
is same as in the binary you

186
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:29,759
is same as in the binary you
 

187
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,830
is same as in the binary you
shift it as one one bit okay so look

188
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:33,840
shift it as one one bit okay so look
 

189
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,430
shift it as one one bit okay so look
what's this mean

190
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:35,440
what's this mean
 

191
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,790
what's this mean
all right one zero one zero one

192
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:38,800
all right one zero one zero one
 

193
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,189
all right one zero one zero one
when you do this n is this one when you

194
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:41,199
when you do this n is this one when you
 

195
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,030
when you do this n is this one when you
do this and

196
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:43,040
do this and
 

197
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,670
do this and
shift the shift equals one shift to the

198
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:45,680
shift the shift equals one shift to the
 

199
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,350
shift the shift equals one shift to the
right one position

200
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:47,360
right one position
 

201
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,430
right one position
where is that you shift to one to the

202
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:49,440
where is that you shift to one to the
 

203
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,110
where is that you shift to one to the
right what happened

204
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:51,120
right what happened
 

205
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,469
right what happened
the rightmost one gone then it becomes

206
00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:54,479
the rightmost one gone then it becomes
 

207
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,430
the rightmost one gone then it becomes
that and you shift one more the last

208
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:57,440
that and you shift one more the last
 

209
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,029
that and you shift one more the last
zero okay yeah and if it is

210
00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:01,039
zero okay yeah and if it is
 

211
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,909
zero okay yeah and if it is
the the opposite way yeah it shifts to

212
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:03,919
the the opposite way yeah it shifts to
 

213
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:04,629
the the opposite way yeah it shifts to
the left

214
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:04,639
the left
 

215
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,469
the left
what does it become you put a zero at

216
00:05:06,469 --> 00:05:06,479
what does it become you put a zero at
 

217
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:22,469
what does it become you put a zero at
the end and do it one more time

218
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:22,479

 

219
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,710

shift equals two what what does it

220
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:24,720
shift equals two what what does it
 

221
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,150
shift equals two what what does it
become

222
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:26,160
become
 

223
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,909
become
e6 you take away two zeros

224
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:29,919
e6 you take away two zeros
 

225
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,110
e6 you take away two zeros
easy yeah so this means i take away

226
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:33,120
easy yeah so this means i take away
 

227
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,590
easy yeah so this means i take away
one digit at the end when i add it if

228
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:35,600
one digit at the end when i add it if
 

229
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,270
one digit at the end when i add it if
it's one then it's one if

230
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:37,280
it's one then it's one if
 

231
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,390
it's one then it's one if
zero is nothing and return one

232
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:40,400
zero is nothing and return one
 

233
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,909
zero is nothing and return one
reason why can you guess answer

234
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:45,919

 

235
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,909

okay so this is one way of doing the

236
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:47,919
okay so this is one way of doing the
 

237
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,189
okay so this is one way of doing the
other way is what

238
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:49,199
other way is what
 

239
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,710
other way is what
defined let's do a country

240
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:52,720
defined let's do a country
 

241
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,430
defined let's do a country
complexity good answer is log n yeah is

242
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:55,440
complexity good answer is log n yeah is
 

243
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,029
complexity good answer is log n yeah is
it logan

244
00:05:57,029 --> 00:05:57,039
it logan
 

245
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,790
it logan
look because if n is 15 then log n

246
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:00,800
look because if n is 15 then log n
 

247
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,230
look because if n is 15 then log n
is four it only has four bits four

248
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:04,240
is four it only has four bits four
 

249
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,430
is four it only has four bits four
iterations yeah

250
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:05,440
iterations yeah
 

251
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,990
iterations yeah
because every time i take a bit in the

252
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:08,000
because every time i take a bit in the
 

253
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,029
because every time i take a bit in the
binary i

254
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:09,039
binary i
 

255
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,950
binary i
cut it out and how many times i need to

256
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:10,960
cut it out and how many times i need to
 

257
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,270
cut it out and how many times i need to
cut for 15

258
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:13,280
cut for 15
 

259
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,909
cut for 15
four times i'm right yeah yeah so look

260
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:15,919
four times i'm right yeah yeah so look
 

261
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,150
four times i'm right yeah yeah so look
at okay how about this

262
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:18,160
at okay how about this
 

263
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,590
at okay how about this
country instead of i just can't count

264
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:21,600
country instead of i just can't count
 

265
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,790
country instead of i just can't count
four counts no no no look look one

266
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:24,800
four counts no no no look look one
 

267
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,230
four counts no no no look look one
zero zero zero two look this is

268
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:28,240
zero zero zero two look this is
 

269
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,309
zero zero zero two look this is
area okay yeah do you need to

270
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:32,319
area okay yeah do you need to
 

271
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,510
area okay yeah do you need to
take away one zero zero zero

272
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:35,520
take away one zero zero zero
 

273
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,070
take away one zero zero zero
we don't right because we know it's zero

274
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:38,080
we don't right because we know it's zero
 

275
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,270
we don't right because we know it's zero
it doesn't matter right

276
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:39,280
it doesn't matter right
 

277
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,070
it doesn't matter right
how about we just take away the last the

278
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:42,080
how about we just take away the last the
 

279
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,070
how about we just take away the last the
right most one

280
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,080
right most one
 

281
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,309
right most one
yeah if we take the right most one we

282
00:06:46,309 --> 00:06:46,319
yeah if we take the right most one we
 

283
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,469
yeah if we take the right most one we
add one to get it

284
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:48,479
add one to get it
 

285
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,870
add one to get it
yeah okay so then look how do we take

286
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:50,880
yeah okay so then look how do we take
 

287
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,350
yeah okay so then look how do we take
away the right most one remember

288
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:53,360
away the right most one remember
 

289
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,790
away the right most one remember
the opposite no no no look look one zero

290
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:56,800
the opposite no no no look look one zero
 

291
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,950
the opposite no no no look look one zero
zero one how do we take away the one

292
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:58,960
zero one how do we take away the one
 

293
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,870
zero one how do we take away the one
all right remember we talked about this

294
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:00,880
all right remember we talked about this
 

295
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,629
all right remember we talked about this
before right look how do we take

296
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:02,639
before right look how do we take
 

297
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,350
before right look how do we take
the number one if we minus one that will

298
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:05,360
the number one if we minus one that will
 

299
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,710
the number one if we minus one that will
become

300
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:06,720
become
 

301
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,830
become
zero zero zero one one one yeah

302
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:09,840
zero zero zero one one one yeah
 

303
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,870
zero zero zero one one one yeah
if we minus one from this this minus one

304
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:12,880
if we minus one from this this minus one
 

305
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,350
if we minus one from this this minus one
you become right yeah all right in

306
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:15,360
you become right yeah all right in
 

307
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:15,990
you become right yeah all right in
binary

308
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:16,000
binary
 

309
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,430
binary
yeah and then we end we do this

310
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:19,440
yeah and then we end we do this
 

311
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,710
yeah and then we end we do this
n logic n

312
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:22,720
n logic n
 

313
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,070
n logic n
0 0 0 0 0 0

314
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,080
0 0 0 0 0 0
 

315
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,350
0 0 0 0 0 0
1 3 so basically if n

316
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:29,360
1 3 so basically if n
 

317
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,350
1 3 so basically if n
you want to take away lemons and you you

318
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:31,360
you want to take away lemons and you you
 

319
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,629
you want to take away lemons and you you
will become

320
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:32,639
will become
 

321
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,230
will become
n and n minus one right so in short you

322
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:36,240
n and n minus one right so in short you
 

323
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,110
n and n minus one right so in short you
will you write

324
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:37,120
will you write
 

325
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,390
will you write
n equals n minus one it's the same thing

326
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:40,400
n equals n minus one it's the same thing
 

327
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,589
n equals n minus one it's the same thing
okay

328
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:41,599
okay
 

329
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,510
okay
so every time we take away the rainbows

330
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:43,520
so every time we take away the rainbows
 

331
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,510
so every time we take away the rainbows
one until it's zero

332
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:45,520
one until it's zero
 

333
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,430
one until it's zero
so it's quicker right it's just look at

334
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:47,440
so it's quicker right it's just look at
 

335
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,629
so it's quicker right it's just look at
this one first

336
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:48,639
this one first
 

337
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,270
this one first
it doesn't look under each digit it skip

338
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:51,280
it doesn't look under each digit it skip
 

339
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,350
it doesn't look under each digit it skip
the digits am right

340
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:53,360
the digits am right
 

341
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,270
the digits am right
yeah so look this is useful

342
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:57,280
yeah so look this is useful
 

343
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,029
yeah so look this is useful
you want if we want to check the power

344
00:07:59,029 --> 00:07:59,039
you want if we want to check the power
 

345
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,710
you want if we want to check the power
of 2 if number

346
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:00,720
of 2 if number
 

347
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,150
of 2 if number
is the power of 2 remember we talked

348
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:02,160
is the power of 2 remember we talked
 

349
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,189
is the power of 2 remember we talked
about this before 8

350
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:05,199
about this before 8
 

351
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,670
about this before 8
yeah hey look if it's the power of 2

352
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:09,680
yeah hey look if it's the power of 2
 

353
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,469
yeah hey look if it's the power of 2
2 to the power 3 yeah one it only has

354
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:12,479
2 to the power 3 yeah one it only has
 

355
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:13,430
2 to the power 3 yeah one it only has
one yeah

356
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:13,440
one yeah
 

357
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,629
one yeah
it only has one right it has only has a

358
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:16,639
it only has one right it has only has a
 

359
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,230
it only has one right it has only has a
single one in the binary

360
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:18,240
single one in the binary
 

361
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,189
single one in the binary
so it will be n n minus one that will

362
00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:21,199
so it will be n n minus one that will
 

363
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,869
so it will be n n minus one that will
become zero right

364
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:22,879
become zero right
 

365
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,950
become zero right
you get it if it's one followed by four

366
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:26,960
you get it if it's one followed by four
 

367
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,670
you get it if it's one followed by four
zeros

368
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:27,680
zeros
 

369
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,110
zeros
the same thing right i will look at this

370
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:31,120
the same thing right i will look at this
 

371
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,269
the same thing right i will look at this
this is two to the power four one two

372
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:33,279
this is two to the power four one two
 

373
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,909
this is two to the power four one two
three four it's 16 in binary right

374
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:35,919
three four it's 16 in binary right
 

375
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,110
three four it's 16 in binary right
yeah so what n minus one what's n minus

376
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:39,120
yeah so what n minus one what's n minus
 

377
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,790
yeah so what n minus one what's n minus
one

378
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:40,800
one
 

379
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,790
one
n minus one zero

380
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:44,800
n minus one zero
 

381
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,829
n minus one zero
one one one what's n

382
00:08:47,829 --> 00:08:47,839
one one one what's n
 

383
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,190
one one one what's n
what's n what what what is

384
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:51,200
what's n what what what is
 

385
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,550
what's n what what what is
zero it's zero yeah only one is n

386
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:54,560
zero it's zero yeah only one is n
 

387
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,870
zero it's zero yeah only one is n
it means the both if both number is one

388
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:56,880
it means the both if both number is one
 

389
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,550
it means the both if both number is one
it's one otherwise it's all zero

390
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:58,560
it's one otherwise it's all zero
 

391
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,430
it's one otherwise it's all zero
okay zero sorry

392
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:03,440
okay zero sorry
 

393
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,389
okay zero sorry
for zero it's yellow so only it's only

394
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:06,399
for zero it's yellow so only it's only
 

395
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:06,829
for zero it's yellow so only it's only
one

396
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:06,839
one
 

397
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:10,070
one
when both sides are one okay

398
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:10,080
when both sides are one okay
 

399
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,350
when both sides are one okay
all right three three cases zero okay

400
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:13,360
all right three three cases zero okay
 

401
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,470
all right three three cases zero okay
but for the o it's different it's one at

402
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:16,480
but for the o it's different it's one at
 

403
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,389
but for the o it's different it's one at
ol one of nine is one then it's one it's

404
00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:20,399
ol one of nine is one then it's one it's
 

405
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,910
ol one of nine is one then it's one it's
one zero or

406
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:21,920
one zero or
 

407
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,030
one zero or
zero one or one one is one for all yeah

408
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:25,040
zero one or one one is one for all yeah
 

409
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,269
zero one or one one is one for all yeah
always orion yeah one of them

410
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:29,279
always orion yeah one of them
 

411
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,389
always orion yeah one of them
is true is true right eric and ryan

412
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:32,399
is true is true right eric and ryan
 

413
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,430
is true is true right eric and ryan
both of you needs to be true then

414
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:35,440
both of you needs to be true then
 

415
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,990
both of you needs to be true then
d2 okay it's something this is logic

416
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:38,000
d2 okay it's something this is logic
 

417
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,790
d2 okay it's something this is logic
okay

418
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:38,800
okay
 

419
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,230
okay
okay so this is also o log n right

420
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:42,240
okay so this is also o log n right
 

421
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,150
okay so this is also o log n right
yeah okay now suppose we have these

422
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:46,160
yeah okay now suppose we have these
 

423
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,590
yeah okay now suppose we have these
functions already okay

424
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:47,600
functions already okay
 

425
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,389
functions already okay
so now given okay given a number

426
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:52,399
so now given okay given a number
 

427
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,670
so now given okay given a number
n okay now listen carefully given the

428
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:55,680
n okay now listen carefully given the
 

429
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,750
n okay now listen carefully given the
number n

430
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:57,760
number n
 

431
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,750
number n
and i want you to find out

432
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:01,760
and i want you to find out
 

433
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,670
and i want you to find out
i want you to print out a list of

434
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:03,680
i want you to print out a list of
 

435
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,750
i want you to print out a list of
integers containing the number

436
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:05,760
integers containing the number
 

437
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,710
integers containing the number
of bits for the num all numbers between

438
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:08,720
of bits for the num all numbers between
 

439
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,590
of bits for the num all numbers between
zero

440
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:09,600
zero
 

441
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,110
zero
bigger than so x okay bigger than zero

442
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:13,120
bigger than so x okay bigger than zero
 

443
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,030
bigger than so x okay bigger than zero
and smaller equals n

444
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,040
and smaller equals n
 

445
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,509
and smaller equals n
so this is given for example this is

446
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:17,519
so this is given for example this is
 

447
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,069
so this is given for example this is
when n

448
00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:18,079
when n
 

449
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,829
when n
is is three okay so now i want you to

450
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:21,839
is is three okay so now i want you to
 

451
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,910
is is three okay so now i want you to
find all the numbers between

452
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:23,920
find all the numbers between
 

453
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,670
find all the numbers between
uh less than three or equals three

454
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:25,680
uh less than three or equals three
 

455
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,750
uh less than three or equals three
bigger than zero so you'll be zero

456
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:27,760
bigger than zero so you'll be zero
 

457
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,790
bigger than zero so you'll be zero
one two three yeah yeah yeah

458
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:30,800
one two three yeah yeah yeah
 

459
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,670
one two three yeah yeah yeah
and then i want you to give me an array

460
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:33,680
and then i want you to give me an array
 

461
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,550
and then i want you to give me an array
containing

462
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:34,560
containing
 

463
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,990
containing
the number of ones in each digit so zero

464
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:38,000
the number of ones in each digit so zero
 

465
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,470
the number of ones in each digit so zero
will be zero one will be only one right

466
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:40,480
will be zero one will be only one right
 

467
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,670
will be zero one will be only one right
two how many

468
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:41,680
two how many
 

469
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,350
two how many
ones in two two how many ones in two z

470
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:45,360
ones in two two how many ones in two z
 

471
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,069
ones in two two how many ones in two z
one is zero

472
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:46,079
one is zero
 

473
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,870
one is zero
it's one yeah how many ones in three

474
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:48,880
it's one yeah how many ones in three
 

475
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,310
it's one yeah how many ones in three
zero

476
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:50,320
zero
 

477
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,710
zero
one what's three in binary

478
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:54,720
one what's three in binary
 

479
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,069
one what's three in binary
look zero let's binary one one zero

480
00:10:58,069 --> 00:10:58,079
look zero let's binary one one zero
 

481
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,829
look zero let's binary one one zero
what's next

482
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:01,839
what's next
 

483
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,949
what's next
one zero one one one look you always

484
00:11:04,949 --> 00:11:04,959
one zero one one one look you always
 

485
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:10,470
one zero one one one look you always
increment the last thing and what's next

486
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:10,480

 

487
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:22,389

and what's next one

488
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:22,399

 

489
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,110

zero come on you adding one and then you

490
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:25,120
zero come on you adding one and then you
 

491
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,550
zero come on you adding one and then you
carry over you'll be one and this

492
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:26,560
carry over you'll be one and this
 

493
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,269
carry over you'll be one and this
becomes zero and what's next

494
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:29,279
becomes zero and what's next
 

495
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,949
becomes zero and what's next
one one one okay and what's next

[Music]
 

525
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,310
[Music]
it's basically the same as like

526
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:28,320
it's basically the same as like
 

527
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,550
it's basically the same as like
9 what's next 10 yeah 99 what's next 100

528
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:32,560
9 what's next 10 yeah 99 what's next 100
 

529
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,590
9 what's next 10 yeah 99 what's next 100
yeah

530
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:33,600
yeah
 

531
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,190
yeah
and you make mistakes on this

532
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:37,200
and you make mistakes on this
 

533
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,829
and you make mistakes on this
one zero one plus one one zero one plus

534
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:39,839
one zero one plus one one zero one plus
 

535
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:40,949
one zero one plus one one zero one plus
one you say it's one

536
00:12:40,949 --> 00:12:40,959
one you say it's one
 

537
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,629
one you say it's one
one it's not true look one plus one

538
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:42,639
one it's not true look one plus one
 

539
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,389
one it's not true look one plus one
equals zero carry over one

540
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:44,399
equals zero carry over one
 

541
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,629
equals zero carry over one
so it's one one zero okay got it

542
00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:48,639
so it's one one zero okay got it
 

543
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,949
so it's one one zero okay got it
okay so look

544
00:12:52,949 --> 00:12:52,959
okay so look
 

545
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,910
okay so look
given the number n and then you find all

546
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:55,920
given the number n and then you find all
 

547
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,069
given the number n and then you find all
the number of bits between the numbers 0

548
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:58,079
the number of bits between the numbers 0
 

549
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,509
the number of bits between the numbers 0
to n right

550
00:12:59,509 --> 00:12:59,519
to n right
 

551
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,949
to n right
how can we do this eric all right

552
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:02,959
how can we do this eric all right
 

553
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,310
how can we do this eric all right
you can just write the number your

554
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:04,320
you can just write the number your
 

555
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,030
you can just write the number your
answer is look answer equals zero and

556
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:07,040
answer is look answer equals zero and
 

557
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:07,350
answer is look answer equals zero and
then

558
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:07,360
then
 

559
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,629
then
look for four

560
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:10,639
look for four
 

561
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:16,389
look for four
i in range

562
00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:16,399

 

563
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,310

range one tier n plus one yeah

564
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:20,320
range one tier n plus one yeah
 

565
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,949
range one tier n plus one yeah
and then i can just say answer don't

566
00:13:22,949 --> 00:13:22,959
and then i can just say answer don't
 

567
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,710
and then i can just say answer don't
append

ready yeah count yeah
 

571
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,550
ready yeah count yeah
count i that's it when we can answer

572
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:32,560
count i that's it when we can answer
 

573
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,410
count i that's it when we can answer
what's the complexity

574
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:37,420

 

575
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:43,509

if it is count no no no yeah
 

579
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,910
if it is count no no no yeah
we if we using the first first count

580
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:49,920
we if we using the first first count
 

581
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,110
we if we using the first first count
what's the complexity oh and logan why

582
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:53,120
what's the complexity oh and logan why
 

583
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,750
what's the complexity oh and logan why
is it

584
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:53,760
is it
 

585
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,030

yeah how we can can we do better
 

605
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,990
yeah how we can can we do better
one hint

606

we are counting the numbers uh number of
 

629
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,629
we are counting the numbers uh number of
bits from number zeros to

bits from number zeros to
 

631
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,629
bits from number zeros to
number n do we need to count every

632
00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:02,639
number n do we need to count every
 

633
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:03,750

yeah no no we don't have every time
 

637
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:16,470
yeah no no we don't have every time
look if if we know look if you know

638
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:16,480

 

639
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,670

yeah look what's this in binary that

640
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:19,680
yeah look what's this in binary that
 

641
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,750
yeah look what's this in binary that
is well in decimal is a plus 4

642
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:23,760
is well in decimal is a plus 4
 

643
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,470
is well in decimal is a plus 4
is 12 yeah this is a this is four yeah

644
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:26,480
is 12 yeah this is a this is four yeah
 

645
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,470
is 12 yeah this is a this is four yeah
this is two this is one right

646
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:28,480
this is two this is one right
 

647
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,710
this is two this is one right
this is 12. so and what what's this you

648
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:32,720
this is 12. so and what what's this you
 

649
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,430
this is 12. so and what what's this you
find uh

650
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:33,440
find uh
 

651
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,749
find uh
what's this in

652
00:15:37,749 --> 00:15:37,759

 

653
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,030

what's this in binary okay yeah

654
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:41,040
what's this in binary okay yeah
 

655
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,470
what's this in binary okay yeah
finally let's take okay so eight

656
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:44,480
finally let's take okay so eight
 

657
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,069
finally let's take okay so eight
plus one okay and twelve

658
00:15:48,069 --> 00:15:48,079
plus one okay and twelve
 

659
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,829
plus one okay and twelve
last one equals thirteen so if i tell

660
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:51,839
last one equals thirteen so if i tell
 

661
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:52,710
last one equals thirteen so if i tell
you

662
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:52,720
you
 

663
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,829
you
if i tell you okay if i tell you

664
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:55,839
if i tell you okay if i tell you
 

665
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,269
if i tell you okay if i tell you
eight if i tell you eight has only one

666
00:15:59,269 --> 00:15:59,279
eight if i tell you eight has only one
 

667
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,550
eight if i tell you eight has only one
one single one okay how many one

668
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:02,560
one single one okay how many one
 

669
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,790
one single one okay how many one
yeah it is yeah you don't need to

670
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:04,800
yeah it is yeah you don't need to
 

671
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,430
yeah it is yeah you don't need to
calculate i already give you that

672
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:07,440
calculate i already give you that
 

673
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,790
calculate i already give you that
f8 is one

674
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:10,800
f8 is one
 

675
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,990
f8 is one
and then you know 12

676
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:16,000
and then you know 12
 

677
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,910
and then you know 12
12 is one single bit after

678
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:19,920
12 is one single bit after
 

679
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,350
12 is one single bit after
one single bit more than eight yeah

680
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:23,360
one single bit more than eight yeah
 

681
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,710
one single bit more than eight yeah
so f12 is one t

682
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:26,720
so f12 is one t
 

683
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,749
so f12 is one t
two and this will be s a plus one right

684
00:16:29,749 --> 00:16:29,759
two and this will be s a plus one right
 

685
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,749
two and this will be s a plus one right
yeah do you see the problem dynamic

686
00:16:31,749 --> 00:16:31,759
yeah do you see the problem dynamic
 

687
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,350
yeah do you see the problem dynamic
programming

688
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:33,360
programming
 

689
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,389
programming
do you get it yeah so the basically is

690
00:16:36,389 --> 00:16:36,399
do you get it yeah so the basically is
 

691
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:36,870
do you get it yeah so the basically is
like

692
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:36,880
like
 

693
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,829
like
how do we get the right uh how do we can

694
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:39,839
how do we get the right uh how do we can
 

695
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,990
how do we get the right uh how do we can
write normal speed

696
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:42,000
write normal speed
 

697
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,389
write normal speed
right most speed look f n

698
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:46,399
right most speed look f n
 

699
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,590
right most speed look f n
equals f

700
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:49,600
equals f
 

701
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,509
equals f
and if we can read the right one more

702
00:16:53,509 --> 00:16:53,519
and if we can read the right one more
 

703
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:54,710
and if we can read the right one more
speed that would be

704
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:54,720
speed that would be
 

705
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,870
speed that would be
this yeah we talk about that yeah look

706
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:56,880
this yeah we talk about that yeah look
 

707
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,189
this yeah we talk about that yeah look
look what's this

708
00:16:59,189 --> 00:16:59,199
look what's this
 

709
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:03,110
look what's this
one one zero zero minus one

710
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:03,120
one one zero zero minus one
 

711
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,069
one one zero zero minus one
one zero one one yeah yeah what's the

712
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:06,079
one zero one one yeah yeah what's the
 

713
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,110
one zero one one yeah yeah what's the
answer

714
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:07,120
answer
 

715
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:14,230
answer
beyonce is zero zero sorry

716
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:14,240

 

717
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,189

okay so look fn i can't read the right

718
00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:17,199
okay so look fn i can't read the right
 

719
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:18,710
okay so look fn i can't read the right
mouse bit

720
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:18,720
mouse bit
 

721
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,429
mouse bit
and then i'll be what should i do here

722
00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:21,439
and then i'll be what should i do here
 

723
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,669
and then i'll be what should i do here
what should i do here

724
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:23,679
what should i do here
 

725
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,510
what should i do here
what's the answer this is f is the

726
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:25,520
what's the answer this is f is the
 

727
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,710
what's the answer this is f is the
number of bits in

728
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:26,720
number of bits in
 

729
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,270
number of bits in
for the number of integer n and then if

730
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:29,280
for the number of integer n and then if
 

731
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,110
for the number of integer n and then if
i get rid of right most bit

732
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:31,120
i get rid of right most bit
 

733
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,310
i get rid of right most bit
i get rid of one bit and what

734
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:34,320
i get rid of one bit and what
 

735
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,140
i get rid of one bit and what
what should i do here

736
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:37,150
what should i do here
 

737
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:39,750
what should i do here
[Music]

738
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:39,760
[Music]
 

739
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,870
[Music]
i have f 12 equals

740
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:42,880
i have f 12 equals
 

741
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,950
i have f 12 equals
f 12 12 minus this is 12

742
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:46,960
f 12 12 minus this is 12
 

743
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,310
f 12 12 minus this is 12
and n and one minus one is this is

744
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:50,320
and n and one minus one is this is
 

745
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,430
and n and one minus one is this is
eleven

746
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:51,440
eleven
 

747
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,990
eleven
this is eleven yeah yeah and that would

748
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:54,000
this is eleven yeah yeah and that would
 

749
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,950
this is eleven yeah yeah and that would
be

750
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:54,960
be
 

751
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:06,310
be
this will be a yeah yeah f a one

752
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:06,320

 

753
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,270

so every time we want to calculate fn we

754
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:09,280
so every time we want to calculate fn we
 

755
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:09,750
so every time we want to calculate fn we
get

756
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:09,760
get
 

757
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,590
get
get rid of the one in binary

758
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:13,600
get rid of the one in binary
 

759
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,390
get rid of the one in binary
just erase it becomes zero right and

760
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:16,400
just erase it becomes zero right and
 

761
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:16,710
just erase it becomes zero right and
this

762
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:16,720
this
 

763
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,830
this
these f and and n minus one we already

764
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:19,840
these f and and n minus one we already
 

765
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,350
these f and and n minus one we already
calculated before

766
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:21,360
calculated before
 

767
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,750
calculated before
right and then what's the difference

768
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:23,760
right and then what's the difference
 

769
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,430
right and then what's the difference
what's the answer difference

770
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:25,440
what's the answer difference
 

771
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,190
what's the answer difference
there'll be only one difference yeah

772
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:27,200
there'll be only one difference yeah
 

773
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,350
there'll be only one difference yeah
because i i can't read the one

774
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:29,360
because i i can't read the one
 

775
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,870
because i i can't read the one
and i need to plus one yeah you get it

776
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:32,880
and i need to plus one yeah you get it
 

777
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,029
and i need to plus one yeah you get it
okay so now we can we can write this

778
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:35,039
okay so now we can we can write this
 

779
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,470
okay so now we can we can write this
look

780
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:36,480
look
 

781
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,909
look
uh define uh let's do this uh

782
00:18:39,909 --> 00:18:39,919
uh define uh let's do this uh
 

783
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,029
uh define uh let's do this uh
f okay n and then i do this answer

784
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:43,039
f okay n and then i do this answer
 

785
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:43,669

n right okay so i
please so i i want to get rid of the

826
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:39,440
please so i i want to get rid of the
 

827
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,789
please so i i want to get rid of the
right monster one

828
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:40,799
right monster one
 

829
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,430
right monster one
you don't have this yeah i i want to get

830
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:43,440
you don't have this yeah i i want to get
 

831
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,669
you don't have this yeah i i want to get
rid of right most one what should i do

832
00:19:45,669 --> 00:19:45,679
rid of right most one what should i do
 

833
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,870
rid of right most one what should i do
i what

834
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:48,880
i what
 

835
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,990
i what
i minus one what's what's that i

836
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:52,000
i minus one what's what's that i
 

837
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,669
i minus one what's what's that i
minus i not equal

838
00:19:55,669 --> 00:19:55,679
minus i not equal
 

839
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,830
minus i not equal
i talk about like all the time 12

840
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:57,840
i talk about like all the time 12
 

841
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,029
i talk about like all the time 12
becomes

842
00:19:59,029 --> 00:19:59,039
becomes
 

843
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,390
becomes
12 becomes a what's what 12 how how

844
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:02,400
12 becomes a what's what 12 how how
 

845
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,630
12 becomes a what's what 12 how how
how does claire become 8.

846
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:06,640
how does claire become 8.
 

847
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,390
how does claire become 8.
one bit okay so how do we take one bit

848
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:10,400
one bit okay so how do we take one bit
 

849
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,909
one bit okay so how do we take one bit
and and what

850
00:20:13,909 --> 00:20:13,919
and and what
 

851
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,950
and and what
come on look 12 is one one zero zero i

852
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:16,960
come on look 12 is one one zero zero i
 

853
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,390
come on look 12 is one one zero zero i
take away one bit

854
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:18,400
take away one bit
 

855
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,630
take away one bit
i minus one what's what's square minus

856
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:20,640
i minus one what's what's square minus
 

857
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,990
i minus one what's what's square minus
one is eleven right

858
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:22,000
one is eleven right
 

859
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,950
one is eleven right
in final would be one zero one one yeah

860
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:24,960
in final would be one zero one one yeah
 

861
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,390
in final would be one zero one one yeah
and then if i do this

862
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:26,400
and then if i do this
 

863
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,669
and then if i do this
n it'll become one zero zero zero okay

864
00:20:29,669 --> 00:20:29,679
n it'll become one zero zero zero okay
 

865
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:37,700
n it'll become one zero zero zero okay
so that's how we do to the one big yeah

866
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:37,710

 

867
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:46,830

869
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,909

i

870
00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:49,919

 

871
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,029

uh minus one yeah come on it's here

872
00:20:53,029 --> 00:20:53,039
uh minus one yeah come on it's here
 

873
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,750
uh minus one yeah come on it's here
what you're looking at what's the

874
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:55,760
what you're looking at what's the
 

875
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,870
what you're looking at what's the
complexity

876
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:56,880
complexity
 

877
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,549
complexity
um what's the complexity and

878
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:00,559
um what's the complexity and
 

879
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,840
um what's the complexity and
no there's

880
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:02,850
no there's
 

881
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:14,830
no there's
[Music]

883
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,830

answer we can also do this look

884
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:17,840
answer we can also do this look
 

885
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,510
answer we can also do this look
there's only one there's another way

886
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:19,520
there's only one there's another way
 

887
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,789
there's only one there's another way
yeah

888
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:22,799

 

889
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,710

look look this is taking the one bit

890
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:26,720
look look this is taking the one bit
 

891
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,470
look look this is taking the one bit
yeah taking the one bit they'll become

892
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:28,480
yeah taking the one bit they'll become
 

893
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,590
yeah taking the one bit they'll become
one one zero zero one zero right you

894
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:31,600
one one zero zero one zero right you
 

895
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,230
one one zero zero one zero right you
take over

896
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:32,240
take over
 

897
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,789
take over
the right most one bit yeah how about i

898
00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:34,799
the right most one bit yeah how about i
 

899
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:35,990
the right most one bit yeah how about i
can do this

900
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:36,000
can do this
 

901
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,710
can do this
how about if i take away the right most

902
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:38,720
how about if i take away the right most
 

903
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,390
how about if i take away the right most
bit

904
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:40,400
bit
 

905
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,430
bit
you become one one zero okay this is the

906
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:43,440
you become one one zero okay this is the
 

907
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,230
you become one one zero okay this is the
same so

908
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:44,240
same so
 

909
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,510
same so
answer i equals i

910
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:47,520
answer i equals i
 

911
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,630
answer i equals i
how can i take away the normal speed

912
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:50,640
how can i take away the normal speed
 

913
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,830
how can i take away the normal speed
and no i remember we're shifting

914
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:53,840
and no i remember we're shifting
 

915
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,149
and no i remember we're shifting
yeah c y y one yeah

916
00:21:58,149 --> 00:21:58,159
yeah c y y one yeah
 

917
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,870
yeah c y y one yeah
yeah do you need equal no because this

918
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:00,880
yeah do you need equal no because this
 

919
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,750
yeah do you need equal no because this
is just the

920
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:01,760
is just the
 

921
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,510
is just the
evaluation i take away the rainbow

922
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:03,520
evaluation i take away the rainbow
 

923
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,750
evaluation i take away the rainbow
street i shift it to the right yeah

924
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:05,760
street i shift it to the right yeah
 

925
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,029
street i shift it to the right yeah
but how do you know if it's the

926
00:22:07,029 --> 00:22:07,039
but how do you know if it's the
 

927
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,710
but how do you know if it's the
rightmost speed you need to add one or

928
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:08,720
rightmost speed you need to add one or
 

929
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,430
rightmost speed you need to add one or
no

930
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:09,440
no
 

931
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,830
no
if it's zero we don't care if it's one

932
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:11,840
if it's zero we don't care if it's one
 

933
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,149
if it's zero we don't care if it's one
we need to add one right

934
00:22:14,149 --> 00:22:14,159
we need to add one right
 

935
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,270
we need to add one right
so plus what's only plus here

936
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:17,280
so plus what's only plus here
 

937
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,950
so plus what's only plus here
we know plus one because it might be

938
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:18,960
we know plus one because it might be
 

939
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,669
we know plus one because it might be
zero so how can we check if we need to

940
00:22:21,669 --> 00:22:21,679
zero so how can we check if we need to
 

941
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:22,789
zero so how can we check if we need to
check i

942
00:22:22,789 --> 00:22:22,799
check i
 

943
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:27,270
check i
the last bit of the if the integer

944
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:27,280
the last bit of the if the integer
 

945
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,990
the last bit of the if the integer
integer n what's the rightmost speed how

946
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:30,000
integer n what's the rightmost speed how
 

947
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,510
integer n what's the rightmost speed how
can we get it

948
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:33,520

 

949
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:38,070

and and what i

950
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:38,080
and and what i
 

951
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,110
and and what i
n and what the

952
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:41,120
n and what the
 

953
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,070
n and what the
last bit look you could release and how

954
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:44,080
last bit look you could release and how
 

955
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:44,870
last bit look you could release and how
can i

956
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:44,880
can i
 

957
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,549
can i
get the last bit i can do this

958
00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:48,559
get the last bit i can do this
 

959
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:52,950
get the last bit i can do this
yeah look at me what's this number

960
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:52,960
yeah look at me what's this number
 

961
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,350
yeah look at me what's this number
that's one one look if it's one the last

962
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:55,360
that's one one look if it's one the last
 

963
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,230
that's one one look if it's one the last
bit is one

964
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:56,240
bit is one
 

965
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:01,990
bit is one
then it's it's one if it's zero

966
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:02,000

 

967
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,310

if it's yellow then it's yellow right if

968
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:04,320
if it's yellow then it's yellow right if
 

969
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,909
if it's yellow then it's yellow right if
it's one it's one yeah

970
00:23:05,909 --> 00:23:05,919
it's one it's one yeah
 

971
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,149
it's one it's one yeah
all other bits are zero because i have

972
00:23:08,149 --> 00:23:08,159
all other bits are zero because i have
 

973
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:09,350
all other bits are zero because i have
zero here yeah

974
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:09,360
zero here yeah
 

975
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,230
zero here yeah
i don't it doesn't matter if it's one or

976
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:12,240
i don't it doesn't matter if it's one or
 

977
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,270
i don't it doesn't matter if it's one or
zero because

978
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:13,280
zero because
 

979
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,470
zero because
if anything n zero is zero yeah

980
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:16,480
if anything n zero is zero yeah
 

981
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,149
if anything n zero is zero yeah
okay so and and one right yes

982
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:20,159
okay so and and one right yes
 

983
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,430
okay so and and one right yes
all right so look this one will be n

984
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:23,440
all right so look this one will be n
 

985
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,470
all right so look this one will be n
and one why does it doesn't make sense

986
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:26,480
and one why does it doesn't make sense
 

987
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,549
and one why does it doesn't make sense
i want to calculate the number of bits

988
00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:28,559
i want to calculate the number of bits
 

989
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:29,510
i want to calculate the number of bits
in i

990
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:29,520
in i
 

991
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,789
in i
yeah i then i can calculate because i

992
00:23:32,789 --> 00:23:32,799
yeah i then i can calculate because i
 

993
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,070
yeah i then i can calculate because i
already calculated this number is

994
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:34,080
already calculated this number is
 

995
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:34,789
already calculated this number is
smaller than

996
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:34,799
smaller than
 

997
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,029
smaller than
i right because i i take away the last

998
00:23:37,029 --> 00:23:37,039
i right because i i take away the last
 

999
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,350
i right because i i take away the last
bit this number is always smaller than i

1000
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:39,360
bit this number is always smaller than i
 

1001
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,029
bit this number is always smaller than i
am right yes if i take away

1002
00:23:43,029 --> 00:23:43,039
am right yes if i take away
 

1003
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:46,070
am right yes if i take away
one digit the last digit of eight what

1004
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:46,080
one digit the last digit of eight what
 

1005
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,350
one digit the last digit of eight what
will it become

1006
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:47,360
will it become
 

1007
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,390
will it become
in binary four yes we are done

1008
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:50,400
in binary four yes we are done
 

1009
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,070
in binary four yes we are done
the four i already calculated and then

1010
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:54,080
the four i already calculated and then
 

1011
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,470
the four i already calculated and then
but the answer the one i need to take

1012
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:56,480
but the answer the one i need to take
 

1013
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,830
but the answer the one i need to take
away i don't know if it's

1014
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:57,840
away i don't know if it's
 

1015
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,630
away i don't know if it's
take away zero or one and then and i can

1016
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:00,640
take away zero or one and then and i can
 

1017
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,390
take away zero or one and then and i can
do this and one right

1018
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:02,400
do this and one right
 

1019
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,590
do this and one right
yeah how about five look five is

1020
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:05,600
yeah how about five look five is
 

1021
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,029
yeah how about five look five is
one one zero one right

1022
00:24:09,029 --> 00:24:09,039
one one zero one right
 

1023
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:12,870
one one zero one right
five yeah i take away one bit

1024
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:12,880
five yeah i take away one bit
 

1025
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,390
five yeah i take away one bit
no b that will be one zero that will be

1026
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:16,400
no b that will be one zero that will be
 

1027
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,669
no b that will be one zero that will be
two right but the last bit is

1028
00:24:19,669 --> 00:24:19,679
two right but the last bit is
 

1029
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,710
two right but the last bit is
five five and one is one right

1030
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:22,720
five five and one is one right
 

1031
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,430
five five and one is one right
and i need to add one instead of zero

1032
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:25,440
and i need to add one instead of zero
 

1033
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,710
and i need to add one instead of zero
and one yeah

1034
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:26,720
and one yeah
 

1035
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,950
and one yeah
but what's the complexity for this one

1036
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:28,960
but what's the complexity for this one
 

1037
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,840
but what's the complexity for this one
as well

1038
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:32,850
as well
 

1039
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:39,669
as well
[Music]

1040
00:24:39,669 --> 00:24:39,679

 

1041
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,149

yeah you're not thinking when you talk

1042
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:42,159
yeah you're not thinking when you talk
 

1043
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:42,870
yeah you're not thinking when you talk
about the

1044
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:42,880
about the
 

1045
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,990
about the
login okay when we

1046
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:46,000
login okay when we
 

1047
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,350
login okay when we
the first one is because of the car yeah

1048
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:49,360
the first one is because of the car yeah
 

1049
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,710
the first one is because of the car yeah
okay okay that was correct

1050
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:52,720
okay okay that was correct
 

1051
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,310
okay okay that was correct
we're done okay because we're using the

1052
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:54,320
we're done okay because we're using the
 

1053
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,390
we're done okay because we're using the
count function which is login right

1054
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:56,400
count function which is login right
 

1055
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,070
count function which is login right
yeah if we're using the counter

1056
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:00,080
yeah if we're using the counter
 

1057
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,110
yeah if we're using the counter
the first one remember the pin function

1058
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:03,120
the first one remember the pin function
 

1059
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,950
the first one remember the pin function
then the complexity will be on login

1060
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:06,960
then the complexity will be on login
 

1061
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,510
then the complexity will be on login
login am i yes so what's this algorithm

1062
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:11,520
login am i yes so what's this algorithm
 

1063
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:27,430
login am i yes so what's this algorithm
dynamics

1064
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:27,440

 

1065
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,590

you can do it butter up at least this

1066
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:29,600
you can do it butter up at least this
 

1067
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,470
you can do it butter up at least this
problem is

1068
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:30,480
problem is
 

1069
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,470
problem is
it's better to be solved using top down

1070
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:32,480
it's better to be solved using top down
 

1071
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,750
it's better to be solved using top down
because the butter up

1072
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:33,760
because the butter up
 

1073
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,149
because the butter up
you need to start from zero one and then

1074
00:25:36,149 --> 00:25:36,159
you need to start from zero one and then
 

1075
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,710
you need to start from zero one and then
and then you'll be

1076
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:38,720
and then you'll be
 

1077
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,430
and then you'll be
you'll be less i mean less intuitive as

1078
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:41,440
you'll be less i mean less intuitive as
 

1079
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,190
you'll be less i mean less intuitive as
top down because look we want to

1080
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:43,200
top down because look we want to
 

1081
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:43,830
top down because look we want to
calculate

1082
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:43,840
calculate
 

1083
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,350
calculate
i then we can solve it you we can click

1084
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:47,360
i then we can solve it you we can click
 

1085
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,149
i then we can solve it you we can click
we can update the value we can calculate

1086
00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:50,159
we can update the value we can calculate
 

1087
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,310
we can update the value we can calculate
the value based on the smaller problem

1088
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:52,320
the value based on the smaller problem
 

1089
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,830
the value based on the smaller problem
because we already know

1090
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:54,840
because we already know
 

1091
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,830
because we already know
i i

1092
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:57,840
i i
 

1093
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,350
i i
shifted one or i take away the last and

1094
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:01,360
shifted one or i take away the last and
 

1095
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,669
shifted one or i take away the last and
the rightmost one i already know a

1096
00:26:03,669 --> 00:26:03,679
the rightmost one i already know a
 

1097
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:05,990
the rightmost one i already know a
smaller the answer for a smaller problem

1098
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:06,000
smaller the answer for a smaller problem
 

1099
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,269
smaller the answer for a smaller problem
so more smaller integer right yeah and i

1100
00:26:09,269 --> 00:26:09,279
so more smaller integer right yeah and i
 

1101
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,029
so more smaller integer right yeah and i
already know that so this part i don't

1102
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:11,039
already know that so this part i don't
 

1103
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:12,789
already know that so this part i don't
need to calculate it again right this is

1104
00:26:12,789 --> 00:26:12,799
need to calculate it again right this is
 

1105
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:13,750
need to calculate it again right this is
the magic

1106
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:13,760
the magic
 

1107
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,510
the magic
this bit i already know it i memorize it

1108
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:17,520
this bit i already know it i memorize it
 

1109
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,909
this bit i already know it i memorize it
i don't need to calculate it again and

1110
00:26:19,909 --> 00:26:19,919
i don't need to calculate it again and
 

1111
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,549
i don't need to calculate it again and
then the new answer is just plus one or

1112
00:26:22,549 --> 00:26:22,559
then the new answer is just plus one or
 

1113
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,669
then the new answer is just plus one or
yeah do you see how hard it works

1114
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:25,679
yeah do you see how hard it works
 

1115
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,909
yeah do you see how hard it works
yeah okay good job today okay good job

1116
00:26:29,909 --> 00:26:29,919
yeah okay good job today okay good job
