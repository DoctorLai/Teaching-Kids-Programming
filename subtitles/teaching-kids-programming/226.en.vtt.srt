1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,030

hello hello miss larry are you all right

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:03,040
hello hello miss larry are you all right
 

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,910
hello hello miss larry are you all right
okay okay can you stand up please okay

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:05,920
okay okay can you stand up please okay
 

5
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:06,550
okay okay can you stand up please okay
so

6
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:06,560
so
 

7
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,790
so
we're talking about the lines today okay

8
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:08,800
we're talking about the lines today okay
 

9
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,830
we're talking about the lines today okay
the line

10
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:09,840
the line
 

11
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,470
the line
so look given the two points if there

12
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:12,480
so look given the two points if there
 

13
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,150
so look given the two points if there
are two points on the white space how

14
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:14,160
are two points on the white space how
 

15
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,390
are two points on the white space how
many straight lines can you draw across

16
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:16,400
many straight lines can you draw across
 

17
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:16,870
many straight lines can you draw across
the

18
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:16,880
the
 

19
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,990
the
two points how many

20
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:20,000
two points how many
 

21
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,590
two points how many
how many straight lines

22
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:23,600

 

23
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,910

just one yeah you can only draw one

24
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:25,920
just one yeah you can only draw one
 

25
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,630
just one yeah you can only draw one
right

26
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:26,640
right
 

27
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,710
right
this is the shortest distance right only

28
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:28,720
this is the shortest distance right only
 

29
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,550
this is the shortest distance right only
you can only throw away you can't draw

30
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:30,560
you can only throw away you can't draw
 

31
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,990
you can only throw away you can't draw
more than one straight line but you can

32
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:32,000
more than one straight line but you can
 

33
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,709
more than one straight line but you can
draw some some curves yeah

34
00:00:34,709 --> 00:00:34,719
draw some some curves yeah
 

35
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,590
draw some some curves yeah
oh yeah yeah okay but only one straight

36
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:37,600
oh yeah yeah okay but only one straight
 

37
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,389
oh yeah yeah okay but only one straight
line

38
00:00:38,389 --> 00:00:38,399
line
 

39
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,790
line
only one straight lens if these two

40
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:40,800
only one straight lens if these two
 

41
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,069
only one straight lens if these two
points are not the same

42
00:00:42,069 --> 00:00:42,079
points are not the same
 

43
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,910
points are not the same
right if there are these two points

44
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:43,920
right if there are these two points
 

45
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,190
right if there are these two points
collide each other

46
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:45,200
collide each other
 

47
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,110
collide each other
then you can draw as many lines as

48
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:47,120
then you can draw as many lines as
 

49
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,869
then you can draw as many lines as
possible but we are talking about two

50
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:48,879
possible but we are talking about two
 

51
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,069
possible but we are talking about two
different points

52
00:00:50,069 --> 00:00:50,079
different points
 

53
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,189
different points
also this space okay so now

54
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:53,199
also this space okay so now
 

55
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,470
also this space okay so now
this is the line so

56
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:56,480
this is the line so
 

57
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,389
this is the line so
so look given uh x-axis

58
00:01:00,389 --> 00:01:00,399
so look given uh x-axis
 

59
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,430
so look given uh x-axis
y-axis and we can represent the line

60
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:03,440
y-axis and we can represent the line
 

61
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,030
y-axis and we can represent the line
mathematically using this

62
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:05,040
mathematically using this
 

63
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,070
mathematically using this
y equals k x plus b

64
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:08,080
y equals k x plus b
 

65
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,190
y equals k x plus b
where k and b here are constants are the

66
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:11,200
where k and b here are constants are the
 

67
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,270
where k and b here are constants are the
numbers that we already know

68
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:13,280
numbers that we already know
 

69
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,749
numbers that we already know
they won't change constants and the k is

70
00:01:15,749 --> 00:01:15,759
they won't change constants and the k is
 

71
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:16,870
they won't change constants and the k is
called a slope

72
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:16,880
called a slope
 

73
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,870
called a slope
okay the line of snow what's that slope

74
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:18,880
okay the line of snow what's that slope
 

75
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,190
okay the line of snow what's that slope
mean what does it mean

76
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:21,200
mean what does it mean
 

77
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,350
mean what does it mean
what does it mean the slope

78
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:25,360

 

79
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,070

slow is okay okay so if two lanes have

80
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:28,080
slow is okay okay so if two lanes have
 

81
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,510
slow is okay okay so if two lanes have
the same slope

82
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:29,520
the same slope
 

83
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,069
the same slope
what what is it what's the relation of

84
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:32,079
what what is it what's the relation of
 

85
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,109
what what is it what's the relation of
two lands let's

86
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:33,119
two lands let's
 

87
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,710
two lands let's
have the same slope

88
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:36,720

 

89
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,950

well done good job the parallel yeah if

90
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:38,960
well done good job the parallel yeah if
 

91
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,469
well done good job the parallel yeah if
there are two two

92
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:40,479
there are two two
 

93
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,429
there are two two
lines all the lines which have the same

94
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:43,439
lines all the lines which have the same
 

95
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,389
lines all the lines which have the same
slope

96
00:01:44,389 --> 00:01:44,399
slope
 

97
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,230
slope
some k here they are in parallel okay

98
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:48,240
some k here they are in parallel okay
 

99
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,190
some k here they are in parallel okay
and b is the offset of that look for

100
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:51,200
and b is the offset of that look for
 

101
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,310
and b is the offset of that look for
example yeah

102
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:52,320
example yeah
 

103
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,749
example yeah
uh let's say y

104
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:55,759
uh let's say y
 

105
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,749
uh let's say y
equals y equals x

106
00:01:59,749 --> 00:01:59,759
equals y equals x
 

107
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,670
equals y equals x
okay k one k is one b is zero okay eric

108
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:03,680
okay k one k is one b is zero okay eric
 

109
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,870
okay k one k is one b is zero okay eric
look okay come on come on

110
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:06,880
look okay come on come on
 

111
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,070
look okay come on come on
when k is one b is zero so this function

112
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:10,080
when k is one b is zero so this function
 

113
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,309
when k is one b is zero so this function
is

114
00:02:10,309 --> 00:02:10,319
is
 

115
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,750
is
y equals x right so where is line going

116
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:13,760
y equals x right so where is line going
 

117
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,390
y equals x right so where is line going
to be

118
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:14,400
to be
 

119
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,589
to be
is it passing the number zero

120
00:02:17,589 --> 00:02:17,599
is it passing the number zero
 

121
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,350
is it passing the number zero
yeah y equals x what's the line

122
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:21,360
yeah y equals x what's the line
 

123
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,869
yeah y equals x what's the line
going to be be like so how hard we make

124
00:02:24,869 --> 00:02:24,879
going to be be like so how hard we make
 

125
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:25,830
going to be be like so how hard we make
sure you say

126
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:25,840
sure you say
 

127
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,350
sure you say
because we already know there are two

128
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:27,360
because we already know there are two
 

129
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,830
because we already know there are two
points if we can pick up two one when x

130
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:29,840
points if we can pick up two one when x
 

131
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,589
points if we can pick up two one when x
equals zero right what's why

132
00:02:33,589 --> 00:02:33,599

 

133
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,070

so it passes this one yeah when x is one

134
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:36,080
so it passes this one yeah when x is one
 

135
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,630
so it passes this one yeah when x is one
why

136
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:36,640
why
 

137
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,190
why
what's the value of y one okay so it's

138
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:39,200
what's the value of y one okay so it's
 

139
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,470
what's the value of y one okay so it's
one one yeah

140
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:40,480
one one yeah
 

141
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,550
one one yeah
so one is here one zero okay so what's

142
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:42,560
so one is here one zero okay so what's
 

143
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,550
so one is here one zero okay so what's
the line going to be

144
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:46,560

 

145
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,270

you just you just connect these two

146
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:49,280
you just you just connect these two
 

147
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,030
you just you just connect these two
lines why you connect this way

148
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,040
lines why you connect this way
 

149
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,790
lines why you connect this way
this is the length one one yeah yeah

150
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:52,800
this is the length one one yeah yeah
 

151
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,550
this is the length one one yeah yeah
yeah yeah so this line is going to be

152
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:54,560
yeah yeah so this line is going to be
 

153
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,430
yeah yeah so this line is going to be
like that right

154
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:55,440
like that right
 

155
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,190
like that right
okay this is y equals x all right yeah

156
00:02:59,190 --> 00:02:59,200
okay this is y equals x all right yeah
 

157
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,470
okay this is y equals x all right yeah
okay so look if y equals x plus

158
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:02,480
okay so look if y equals x plus
 

159
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,080
okay so look if y equals x plus
one what's line going to be

160
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,090
one what's line going to be
 

161
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,550
one what's line going to be
[Music]

162
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:08,560
[Music]
 

163
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,509
[Music]
what's the when x is zero what's the y

164
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:13,519

 

165
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,589

um x is one so here okay

166
00:03:17,589 --> 00:03:17,599
um x is one so here okay
 

167
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,149
um x is one so here okay
okay as i say it's parallel yeah so you

168
00:03:20,149 --> 00:03:20,159
okay as i say it's parallel yeah so you
 

169
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,309
okay as i say it's parallel yeah so you
should be something like that right

170
00:03:22,309 --> 00:03:22,319
should be something like that right
 

171
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,470
should be something like that right
right that's the y axis look we can we

172
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:24,480
right that's the y axis look we can we
 

173
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,270
right that's the y axis look we can we
can double check this is minus one right

174
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:27,280
can double check this is minus one right
 

175
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,430
can double check this is minus one right
when x is minus one what's the value of

176
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:29,440
when x is minus one what's the value of
 

177
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:36,309
when x is minus one what's the value of
y

178
00:03:36,309 --> 00:03:36,319

 

179
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,630

yeah minus one is zero this is y y is

180
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:38,640
yeah minus one is zero this is y y is
 

181
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,350
yeah minus one is zero this is y y is
zero right

182
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:39,360
zero right
 

183
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,470
zero right
okay so look we could prove that yeah

184
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:42,480
okay so look we could prove that yeah
 

185
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,589
okay so look we could prove that yeah
we visually we can see that when k

186
00:03:45,589 --> 00:03:45,599
we visually we can see that when k
 

187
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,630
we visually we can see that when k
is the same slope is the same the lines

188
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:48,640
is the same slope is the same the lines
 

189
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,910
is the same slope is the same the lines
are paired in parallel okay

190
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:49,920
are paired in parallel okay
 

191
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,390
are paired in parallel okay
just the different values of b okay so

192
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:52,400
just the different values of b okay so
 

193
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,470
just the different values of b okay so
now

194
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:54,480
now
 

195
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,509
now
if if k is zero if the slope is zero can

196
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:57,519
if if k is zero if the slope is zero can
 

197
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:58,070
if if k is zero if the slope is zero can
you draw

198
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:58,080
you draw
 

199
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,869
you draw
any line which it the slow e equals zero

200
00:04:00,869 --> 00:04:00,879
any line which it the slow e equals zero
 

201
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:01,110
any line which it the slow e equals zero
k

202
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:01,120
k
 

203
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,070
k
equals zero so you'll be like y equals

204
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:04,080
equals zero so you'll be like y equals
 

205
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,190
equals zero so you'll be like y equals
zero times

206
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:05,200
zero times
 

207
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,149
zero times
x plus b can you draw let's say zero

208
00:04:08,149 --> 00:04:08,159
x plus b can you draw let's say zero
 

209
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:08,869
x plus b can you draw let's say zero
plus like

210
00:04:08,869 --> 00:04:08,879
plus like
 

211
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,270
plus like
one what's the what's the big line going

212
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:11,280
one what's the what's the big line going
 

213
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,350
one what's the what's the big line going
to be if k equals zero

214
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:13,360
to be if k equals zero
 

215
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,390
to be if k equals zero
slope is zero b equals one and then that

216
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:16,400
slope is zero b equals one and then that
 

217
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,229
slope is zero b equals one and then that
would be y equals zero x plus b

218
00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:18,239
would be y equals zero x plus b
 

219
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:19,909
would be y equals zero x plus b
and we know zero times anything would be

220
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:19,919
and we know zero times anything would be
 

221
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:21,670
and we know zero times anything would be
zero so y equals one

222
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:21,680
zero so y equals one
 

223
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,670
zero so y equals one
so can you talk to me where's the y

224
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:23,680
so can you talk to me where's the y
 

225
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,310
so can you talk to me where's the y
equals one

226
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:26,320
equals one
 

227
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,430
equals one
yeah yeah yeah so you'll be like that

228
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:29,440
yeah yeah yeah so you'll be like that
 

229
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,310
yeah yeah yeah so you'll be like that
yeah no matter

230
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:30,320
yeah no matter
 

231
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,590
yeah no matter
how big how big or how small any value

232
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:33,600
how big how big or how small any value
 

233
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,310
how big how big or how small any value
arbitrarily the value of x y will be

234
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:36,320
arbitrarily the value of x y will be
 

235
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,670
arbitrarily the value of x y will be
always one right

236
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:37,680
always one right
 

237
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,510
always one right
yeah we can see from the graph yeah

238
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:39,520
yeah we can see from the graph yeah
 

239
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,870
yeah we can see from the graph yeah
that's what it means

240
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:40,880
that's what it means
 

241
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,950
that's what it means
yeah so that's very useful to a

242
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:42,960
yeah so that's very useful to a
 

243
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,469
yeah so that's very useful to a
mathematics tool

244
00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:44,479
mathematics tool
 

245
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,749
mathematics tool
to to visualize the land okay so now

246
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:47,759
to to visualize the land okay so now
 

247
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,070
to to visualize the land okay so now
today's task is very very similar

248
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,080
today's task is very very similar
 

249
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,270
today's task is very very similar
or maybe not simple but you know not

250
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:53,280
or maybe not simple but you know not
 

251
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,469
or maybe not simple but you know not
simple nothing but okay so given a few

252
00:04:56,469 --> 00:04:56,479
simple nothing but okay so given a few
 

253
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,390
simple nothing but okay so given a few
points a on any endpoints okay

254
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:00,400
points a on any endpoints okay
 

255
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,469
points a on any endpoints okay
number endpoints encoding the endpoints

256
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:04,479
number endpoints encoding the endpoints
 

257
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,350
number endpoints encoding the endpoints
on the on the whiteboard and we want to

258
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:07,360
on the on the whiteboard and we want to
 

259
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,070
on the on the whiteboard and we want to
know

260
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,080
know
 

261
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,350
know
for example

262
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:11,360
for example
 

263
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,390
for example
the number of maximum

264
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:14,400
the number of maximum
 

265
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,189
the number of maximum
okay for example here the number of max

266
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:17,199
okay for example here the number of max
 

267
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,590
okay for example here the number of max
the max number of points that are on the

268
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:19,600
the max number of points that are on the
 

269
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,790
the max number of points that are on the
same line

270
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:20,800
same line
 

271
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,350
same line
okay so so basically we want to find out

272
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:23,360
okay so so basically we want to find out
 

273
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:23,990
okay so so basically we want to find out
a line

274
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,000
a line
 

275
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,310
a line
that crosses that crosses the most point

276
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:28,320
that crosses that crosses the most point
 

277
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,270
that crosses that crosses the most point
so in this example how many how many the

278
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:31,280
so in this example how many how many the
 

279
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,189
so in this example how many how many the
maximum number of points

280
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:33,199
maximum number of points
 

281
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,270
maximum number of points
how many number of the points you can

282
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:35,280
how many number of the points you can
 

283
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,189
how many number of the points you can
get here

284
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:39,199
get here
 

285
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,990
get here
what's the line going to be and then i'm

286
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:42,000
what's the line going to be and then i'm
 

287
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,270
what's the line going to be and then i'm
thinking like

288
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:43,280
thinking like
 

289
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,430
thinking like
yeah yeah we're done it crosses one two

290
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:45,440
yeah yeah we're done it crosses one two
 

291
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,029
yeah yeah we're done it crosses one two
three four and if you can draw another

292
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:47,039
three four and if you can draw another
 

293
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,310
three four and if you can draw another
line here but you're only crossing

294
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:48,320
line here but you're only crossing
 

295
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,550
line here but you're only crossing
three point yeah that's what it means

296
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:50,560
three point yeah that's what it means
 

297
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,350
three point yeah that's what it means
okay

298
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:51,360
okay
 

299
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,270
okay
so end point how can we

300
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:55,280
so end point how can we
 

301
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,870
so end point how can we
how can we solve this problem what's

302
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:56,880
how can we solve this problem what's
 

303
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,510
how can we solve this problem what's
your idea

304
00:05:59,510 --> 00:05:59,520
your idea
 

305
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,749
your idea
what have we spent most of time

306
00:06:01,749 --> 00:06:01,759
what have we spent most of time
 

307
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,270
what have we spent most of time
discussing the

308
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:03,280
discussing the
 

309
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,310
discussing the
concept of land in the last five minutes

310
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:08,320
concept of land in the last five minutes

what's the concept you learned before

314
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:12,560
what's the concept you learned before
 

315
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,629
what's the concept you learned before
previously the line

316
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:14,639
previously the line
 

317
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:32,629
previously the line
y equals k times x plus b what's this k

318
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:32,639

 

319
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,070

so if i draw the line here these two

320
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:36,080
so if i draw the line here these two
 

321
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:42,230
so if i draw the line here these two
and if i draw the line here here

322
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:42,240

 

323
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,909

what happened what happened to these

324
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:43,919
what happened what happened to these
 

325
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,430
what happened what happened to these
these slopes any

326
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:45,440
these slopes any
 

327
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,510
these slopes any
combination of these these two leads to

328
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:47,520
combination of these these two leads to
 

329
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,550
combination of these these two leads to
these two lists to

mysteries too what happened today
 

333
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,710
mysteries too what happened today
what happened to the slogs i mean

334
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:56,720
what happened to the slogs i mean
 

335
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,830
what happened to the slogs i mean
what are the stuff it's like

336
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:00,840
what are the stuff it's like
 

337
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:07,430
what are the stuff it's like
um i'll understand

338
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:07,440

 

339
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,710

them yeah if they are on the same line

340
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:10,720
them yeah if they are on the same line
 

341
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,430
them yeah if they are on the same line
their slope

342
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:11,440
their slope
 

343
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,510
their slope
must be the same right yeah that's what

344
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:13,520
must be the same right yeah that's what
 

345
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,950
must be the same right yeah that's what
i mean okay so

346
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:14,960
i mean okay so
 

347
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,430
i mean okay so
we have n points we can prove forcing

348
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:17,440
we have n points we can prove forcing
 

349
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,550
we have n points we can prove forcing
the pairs

350
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:18,560
the pairs
 

351
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,629
the pairs
how many pairs are we talking about here

352
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:20,639
how many pairs are we talking about here
 

353
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,309
how many pairs are we talking about here
what's the term complexity if you want

354
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:22,319
what's the term complexity if you want
 

355
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:22,710
what's the term complexity if you want
to

356
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:22,720
to
 

357
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,749
to
proofread and n pairs remember

358
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:25,759
proofread and n pairs remember
 

359
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:34,550
proofread and n pairs remember
what's the time complexity oh

360
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:34,560

 

361
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,670

yeah and put so actually is n times n

362
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:37,680
yeah and put so actually is n times n
 

363
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,990
yeah and put so actually is n times n
minus 1 divided by 2 but this is o n

364
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:40,000
minus 1 divided by 2 but this is o n
 

365
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,189
minus 1 divided by 2 but this is o n
squared okay

366
00:07:41,189 --> 00:07:41,199
squared okay
 

367
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,790
squared okay
1 square pairs yeah one square

368
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:44,800
1 square pairs yeah one square
 

369
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,309
1 square pairs yeah one square
uh so we we can profit one square

370
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:48,319
uh so we we can profit one square
 

371
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,589
uh so we we can profit one square
and then we can group we can count how

372
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:51,599
and then we can group we can count how
 

373
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,110
and then we can group we can count how
many

374
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:53,120
many
 

375
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,909
many
for for each pair we know the slope yeah

376
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:55,919
for for each pair we know the slope yeah
 

377
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:56,550
for for each pair we know the slope yeah
so look

378
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:56,560
so look
 

379
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,270
so look
this slope and then this slope is the

380
00:07:59,270 --> 00:07:59,280
this slope and then this slope is the
 

381
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,350
this slope and then this slope is the
same now we increment one right and this

382
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:01,360
same now we increment one right and this
 

383
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:01,990
same now we increment one right and this
group

384
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:02,000
group
 

385
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,309
group
is the same with increment one so that

386
00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:04,319
is the same with increment one so that
 

387
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,670
is the same with increment one so that
will be look what

388
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:05,680
will be look what
 

389
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,150
will be look what
one two three that would be three this

390
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:08,160
one two three that would be three this
 

391
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,350
one two three that would be three this
counter would be three

392
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:09,360
counter would be three
 

393
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,230
counter would be three
right and then look if we if we choose

394
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:12,240
right and then look if we if we choose
 

395
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:12,950
right and then look if we if we choose
this this

396
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:12,960
this this
 

397
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,350
this this
point and then we prove us this this

398
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:15,360
point and then we prove us this this
 

399
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,309
point and then we prove us this this
pair work

400
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:16,319
pair work
 

401
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,270
pair work
yeah and this the counter will be two

402
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:19,280
yeah and this the counter will be two
 

403
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:19,909
yeah and this the counter will be two
right

404
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:19,919
right
 

405
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,550
right
so this is the maximum number so we want

406
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:22,560
so this is the maximum number so we want
 

407
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,710
so this is the maximum number so we want
to find out the maximum number of these

408
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:24,720
to find out the maximum number of these
 

409
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,230
to find out the maximum number of these
values which is the number of the

410
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:28,240
values which is the number of the
 

411
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,790
values which is the number of the
number of the pair of the lines which

412
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:30,800
number of the pair of the lines which
 

413
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,149
number of the pair of the lines which
have the same slope

414
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:32,159
have the same slope
 

415
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,469
have the same slope
and if there are three pairs of lines

416
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:34,479
and if there are three pairs of lines
 

417
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:35,670
and if there are three pairs of lines
which have the same

418
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:35,680
which have the same
 

419
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:41,110
which have the same
slope and how many points are there

420
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:41,120
slope and how many points are there
 

421
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,990
slope and how many points are there
there are three pairs one pair of okay

422
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:44,000
there are three pairs one pair of okay
 

423
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,829
there are three pairs one pair of okay
one pair of points one pair of

424
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:45,839
one pair of points one pair of
 

425
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,030
one pair of points one pair of
uh there's one pair of the

426
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:49,040
uh there's one pair of the
 

427
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,389
uh there's one pair of the
one pair how many points two two pairs

428
00:08:52,389 --> 00:08:52,399
one pair how many points two two pairs
 

429
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,509
one pair how many points two two pairs
how many points

430
00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:53,519
how many points
 

431
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,630
how many points
four

432
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:58,640

 

433
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,550

i mean okay one pair two points

434
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:02,560
i mean okay one pair two points
 

435
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,190
i mean okay one pair two points
two pairs how many points three three

436
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:05,200
two pairs how many points three three
 

437
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,630
two pairs how many points three three
pairs how many points

438
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:06,640
pairs how many points
 

439
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,470
pairs how many points
oh it's plus one okay that's what i mean

440
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:08,480
oh it's plus one okay that's what i mean
 

441
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,990
oh it's plus one okay that's what i mean
okay yeah yeah

442
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,000
okay yeah yeah
 

443
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,030
okay yeah yeah
got it yes because each

444
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:13,040
got it yes because each
 

445
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,509
got it yes because each
each pair you have got the same same

446
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:15,519
each pair you have got the same same
 

447
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,070
each pair you have got the same same
slope

448
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:16,080
slope
 

449
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,790
slope
and then first of all these three is

450
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:18,800
and then first of all these three is
 

451
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,230
and then first of all these three is
number of the times

452
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:20,240
number of the times
 

453
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,350
number of the times
of the slopes counter and we plus one

454
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:23,360
of the slopes counter and we plus one
 

455
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,389
of the slopes counter and we plus one
which is the number of points yeah okay

456
00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:26,399
which is the number of points yeah okay
 

457
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:26,949
which is the number of points yeah okay
so

458
00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:26,959
so
 

459
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,230
so
let's try this quickly okay can you

460
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:30,240
let's try this quickly okay can you
 

461
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,829
let's try this quickly okay can you
stand up please

462
00:09:34,829 --> 00:09:34,839

 

463
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,310

define a max

464
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:38,320
define a max
 

465
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,949
define a max
point and we have a coordinate

466
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:42,959
point and we have a coordinate
 

467
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,070
point and we have a coordinate
s and will be the length of

468
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:46,080
s and will be the length of
 

469
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,150
s and will be the length of
coordinates so this is the number of

470
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:48,160
coordinates so this is the number of
 

471
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,350
coordinates so this is the number of
points yeah

472
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:49,360
points yeah
 

473
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,949
points yeah
all right if n is smaller than three

474
00:09:52,949 --> 00:09:52,959
all right if n is smaller than three
 

475
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:53,910
all right if n is smaller than three
what does it mean if

476
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:53,920
what does it mean if
 

477
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,870
what does it mean if
we only have two points so how many how

478
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:56,880
we only have two points so how many how
 

479
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,350
we only have two points so how many how
many lines can we have

480
00:09:59,350 --> 00:09:59,360
many lines can we have
 

481
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,430
many lines can we have
one yeah two points if they have two

482
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:03,440
one yeah two points if they have two
 

483
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:03,990
one yeah two points if they have two
points what

484
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:04,000
points what
 

485
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,750
points what
does it mean two points then the two

486
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:05,760
does it mean two points then the two
 

487
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,190
does it mean two points then the two
points will be the lamb

488
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:07,200
points will be the lamb
 

489
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,790
points will be the lamb
let's say that so we just written two

490
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:08,800
let's say that so we just written two
 

491
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,470
let's say that so we just written two
okay yeah

492
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:10,480
okay yeah
 

493
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,949
okay yeah
and we assume that n is bigger than one

494
00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:12,959
and we assume that n is bigger than one
 

495
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:13,990
and we assume that n is bigger than one
okay

496
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:14,000
okay
 

497
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,910
okay
because that doesn't make any sense if

498
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:15,920
because that doesn't make any sense if
 

499
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,110
because that doesn't make any sense if
we only give

500
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:17,120
we only give
 

501
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,069
we only give
one nine right right uh one point right

502
00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:20,079
one nine right right uh one point right
 

503
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:20,389
one nine right right uh one point right
if

504
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:20,399
if
 

505
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,389
if
there's only one point you have can have

506
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:22,399
there's only one point you have can have
 

507
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,670
there's only one point you have can have
uh how many lines

508
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:23,680
uh how many lines
 

509
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,509
uh how many lines
across the point lots infinity okay so

510
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:27,519
across the point lots infinity okay so
 

511
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,350
across the point lots infinity okay so
if n smaller than three uh

512
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:31,360
if n smaller than three uh
 

513
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,710
if n smaller than three uh
maybe we just make it uh explicit if n

514
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:34,720
maybe we just make it uh explicit if n
 

515
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,069
maybe we just make it uh explicit if n
equals two return two right

516
00:10:38,069 --> 00:10:38,079
equals two return two right
 

517
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,389
equals two return two right
if there are two points and these two

518
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:40,399
if there are two points and these two
 

519
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,389
if there are two points and these two
points are on the same line right

520
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:42,399
points are on the same line right
 

521
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,230
points are on the same line right
that's it so now for we want to iterate

522
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:46,240
that's it so now for we want to iterate
 

523
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,670
that's it so now for we want to iterate
for i

524
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:47,680
for i
 

525
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,190
for i
in range don't do this range

526
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:51,200
in range don't do this range
 

527
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,550
in range don't do this range
we start from 1 to n

528
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:54,560
we start from 1 to n
 

529
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,069
we start from 1 to n
i'll show you why

530
00:10:58,069 --> 00:10:58,079

 

531
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,110

and then let's say x one

532
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:01,120
and then let's say x one
 

533
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,150
and then let's say x one
x two equals c o r d

534
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:04,160
x two equals c o r d
 

535
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,069
x two equals c o r d
s i okay then this is the first point

536
00:11:08,069 --> 00:11:08,079
s i okay then this is the first point
 

537
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,190
s i okay then this is the first point
yeah

538
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:09,200
yeah
 

539
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,870
yeah
there are points here and we want to

540
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:10,880
there are points here and we want to
 

541
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,310
there are points here and we want to
iterate for uh

542
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:12,320
iterate for uh
 

543
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,949
iterate for uh
uh it will it proves the pairs this is

544
00:11:14,949 --> 00:11:14,959
uh it will it proves the pairs this is
 

545
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:15,590
uh it will it proves the pairs this is
the first

546
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:15,600
the first
 

547
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,670
the first
the pair of the the first point of the

548
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:17,680
the pair of the the first point of the
 

549
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,590
the pair of the the first point of the
pair and then for

550
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:19,600
pair and then for
 

551
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,710
pair and then for
j in range

552
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:22,720
j in range
 

553
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,190
j in range
up to i okay up to i

554
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:27,200
up to i okay up to i
 

555
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,630
up to i okay up to i
after i and then uh no xb

556
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:30,640
after i and then uh no xb
 

557
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,550
after i and then uh no xb
x1 y1 okay x1 y1 and x2

558
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:34,560
x1 y1 okay x1 y1 and x2
 

559
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,670
x1 y1 okay x1 y1 and x2
y2 equals codes

560
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:37,680
y2 equals codes
 

561
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,710
y2 equals codes
so let's put i of j here come on

562
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:40,720
so let's put i of j here come on
 

563
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,190
so let's put i of j here come on
for j in range i x 2 y 2 equals

564
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:45,200
for j in range i x 2 y 2 equals
 

565
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,150
for j in range i x 2 y 2 equals
uh chords what i ordered

566
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:50,160

 

567
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,430

come on i t here this is the first point

568
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:53,440
come on i t here this is the first point
 

569
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,389
come on i t here this is the first point
j is here so what's your

570
00:11:58,389 --> 00:11:58,399

 

571
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,829

and now let's so and here at this point

572
00:12:01,829 --> 00:12:01,839
and now let's so and here at this point
 

573
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,509
and now let's so and here at this point
here we want to put a slope here in the

574
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:03,519
here we want to put a slope here in the
 

575
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,150
here we want to put a slope here in the
dictionary so when i say slow

576
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:06,160
dictionary so when i say slow
 

577
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:14,310
dictionary so when i say slow
slopes how do you define a dictionary

578
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:14,320

 

579
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,550

curly brace you can do this but let's do

580
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:16,560
curly brace you can do this but let's do
 

581
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,629
curly brace you can do this but let's do
a better way which is before dictionary

582
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:18,639
a better way which is before dictionary
 

583
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,310
a better way which is before dictionary
yeah

584
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:20,320
yeah
 

585
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,509
yeah
this particular one and in interviews

586
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:23,519
this particular one and in interviews
 

587
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,030
this particular one and in interviews
but before time yeah don't do that okay

588
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:27,040
but before time yeah don't do that okay
 

589
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,590
but before time yeah don't do that okay
okay so okay and now yeah you can do

590
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:29,600
okay so okay and now yeah you can do
 

591
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,030
okay so okay and now yeah you can do
this but look

592
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:31,040
this but look
 

593
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,030
this but look
this is a dif what's the difference

594
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:33,040
this is a dif what's the difference
 

595
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,350
this is a dif what's the difference
between these before dictionary and here

596
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:35,360
between these before dictionary and here
 

597
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,269
between these before dictionary and here
and and we open this

598
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:39,279
and and we open this
 

599
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,389
and and we open this
if a key doesn't exist in the default

600
00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:42,399
if a key doesn't exist in the default
 

601
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,430
if a key doesn't exist in the default
dictionary

602
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:43,440
dictionary
 

603
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,710
dictionary
it won't you won't throw any errors but

604
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:46,720
it won't you won't throw any errors but
 

605
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,509
it won't you won't throw any errors but
look if i said d equals this and if i

606
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:49,519
look if i said d equals this and if i
 

607
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,829
look if i said d equals this and if i
want to say

608
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:50,839
want to say
 

609
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,750
want to say
d one

610
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:53,760
d one
 

611
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,949
d one
equals zero then

612
00:12:56,949 --> 00:12:56,959
equals zero then
 

613
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,990
equals zero then
uh you know t one plus

614
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:00,000
uh you know t one plus
 

615
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,470
uh you know t one plus
equals zero one then that's that's not

616
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:02,480
equals zero one then that's that's not
 

617
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,350
equals zero one then that's that's not
going to work

618
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:03,360
going to work
 

619
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,550
going to work
right if you use this syntax because d1

620
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:06,560
right if you use this syntax because d1
 

621
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,150
right if you use this syntax because d1
is not existent

622
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:08,160
is not existent
 

623
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,069
is not existent
you know report error but for this one

624
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:10,079
you know report error but for this one
 

625
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,269
you know report error but for this one
that's okay because

626
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:11,279
that's okay because
 

627
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,990
that's okay because
it doesn't exist then it treats it as a

628
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:14,000
it doesn't exist then it treats it as a
 

629
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,990
it doesn't exist then it treats it as a
default value which is zero or default

630
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:16,000
default value which is zero or default
 

631
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,870
default value which is zero or default
dictionary so

632
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:16,880
dictionary so
 

633
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,430
dictionary so
we use this okay before additionally and

634
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:19,440
we use this okay before additionally and
 

635
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,389
we use this okay before additionally and
then

636
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:20,399
then
 

637
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,230
then
another the slow slope equals what

638
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:24,240
another the slow slope equals what
 

639
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,110
another the slow slope equals what
what's the slope what's the slope look

640
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:27,120
what's the slope what's the slope look
 

641
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,230
what's the slope what's the slope look
here

642
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:28,240
here
 

643
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,990
here
this is slow slow this this slope

644
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:32,000
this is slow slow this this slope
 

645
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,110
this is slow slow this this slope
slope equals this distance look this

646
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:35,120
slope equals this distance look this
 

647
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,550
slope equals this distance look this
decision

648
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:36,560
decision
 

649
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,910
decision
all right this distance

650
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:39,920
all right this distance
 

651
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,509
all right this distance
the y distance data divided by distance

652
00:13:43,509 --> 00:13:43,519
the y distance data divided by distance
 

653
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,710
the y distance data divided by distance
x distance so you'll be theta y delta x

654
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:48,720
x distance so you'll be theta y delta x
 

655
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,430
x distance so you'll be theta y delta x
so this is one this is one that's that's

656
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:51,440
so this is one this is one that's that's
 

657
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,230
so this is one this is one that's that's
uh

658
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:52,240
uh
 

659
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,470
uh
that the k will be one and how about

660
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:54,480
that the k will be one and how about
 

661
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,269
that the k will be one and how about
this

662
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:55,279
this
 

663
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,389
this
if i have another small slope lines this

664
00:13:58,389 --> 00:13:58,399
if i have another small slope lines this
 

665
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,350
if i have another small slope lines this
is two this is one that'll be two right

666
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:01,360
is two this is one that'll be two right
 

667
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,990
is two this is one that'll be two right
so this is y equals x this is y equals

668
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:04,000
so this is y equals x this is y equals
 

669
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,949
so this is y equals x this is y equals
2x

670
00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:04,959
2x
 

671
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,150
2x
you see how do you get a 2 delta y

672
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:08,160
you see how do you get a 2 delta y
 

673
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,710
you see how do you get a 2 delta y
divided delta x y equals x delta y

674
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:10,720
divided delta x y equals x delta y
 

675
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,790
divided delta x y equals x delta y
divided by delta x equals 1 okay

676
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:12,800
divided by delta x equals 1 okay
 

677
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,870
divided by delta x equals 1 okay
so x let's slow what's the slope

678
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:16,880
so x let's slow what's the slope
 

679
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,069
so x let's slow what's the slope
y 2 minus y 1

680
00:14:20,069 --> 00:14:20,079
y 2 minus y 1
 

681
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:24,790
y 2 minus y 1
divided by what divided by

682
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:24,800
divided by what divided by
 

683
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,550
divided by what divided by
x 2 minus 1 t minus y

684
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:28,560
x 2 minus 1 t minus y
 

685
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,350
x 2 minus 1 t minus y
x 1 come on theta theta y divided by

686
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:31,360
x 1 come on theta theta y divided by
 

687
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:31,990
x 1 come on theta theta y divided by
delta x

688
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:32,000
delta x
 

689
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,790
delta x
look if x two might equals x one

690
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:34,800
look if x two might equals x one
 

691
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,430
look if x two might equals x one
whatever n

692
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:35,440
whatever n
 

693
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,590
whatever n
we're dividing by zero right we don't

694
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:37,600
we're dividing by zero right we don't
 

695
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,790
we're dividing by zero right we don't
want to happen if

696
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:38,800
want to happen if
 

697
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,750
want to happen if
a value divided by zero what happened

698
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:41,760
a value divided by zero what happened
 

699
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,310
a value divided by zero what happened
one divided by zero

700
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:44,320
one divided by zero
 

701
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,550
one divided by zero
it's not possible it's not possible yeah

702
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:46,560
it's not possible it's not possible yeah
 

703
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,310
it's not possible it's not possible yeah
but so we want to check

704
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:48,320
but so we want to check
 

705
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,430
but so we want to check
if x1 not

706
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:51,440
if x1 not
 

707
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,189
if x1 not
equals x2 as else we give it an infinite

708
00:14:55,189 --> 00:14:55,199
equals x2 as else we give it an infinite
 

709
00:14:55,199 --> 00:15:00,069
equals x2 as else we give it an infinite
number okay mass dot what

710
00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:00,079

 

711
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,069

and then we have a slow yeah we have

712
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:02,079
and then we have a slow yeah we have
 

713
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,550
and then we have a slow yeah we have
slow we want to put it into the slope

714
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:04,560
slow we want to put it into the slope
 

715
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,750
slow we want to put it into the slope
slows s

716
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:07,760
slows s
 

717
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,870
slows s
what should we do here

718
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:10,880

 

719
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,910

slows

720
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:15,920

 

721
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,710

we want to increment it now we found a

722
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:18,720
we want to increment it now we found a
 

723
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,670
we want to increment it now we found a
line which is

724
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:19,680
line which is
 

725
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,350
line which is
plus one

726
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:23,360
plus one
 

727
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,870
plus one
plus equal one okay right and here

728
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:26,880
plus equal one okay right and here
 

729
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,949
plus equal one okay right and here
none okay i have an answer answer equals

730
00:15:28,949 --> 00:15:28,959
none okay i have an answer answer equals
 

731
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,150
none okay i have an answer answer equals
zero here

732
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:30,160
zero here
 

733
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,389
zero here
right and answer equals max

734
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:34,399
right and answer equals max
 

735
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,350
right and answer equals max
answer and then what should i put here

736
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:37,360
answer and then what should i put here
 

737
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,430
answer and then what should i put here
eric

738
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:39,440
eric
 

739
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,629
eric
all right can you listen to me so slopes

740
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:42,639
all right can you listen to me so slopes
 

741
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,509
all right can you listen to me so slopes
is at least iteration every iteration is

742
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:45,519
is at least iteration every iteration is
 

743
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,430
is at least iteration every iteration is
start a new slope right a new

744
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:47,440
start a new slope right a new
 

745
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,829
start a new slope right a new
dictionary right because we we check

746
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:49,839
dictionary right because we we check
 

747
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,509
dictionary right because we we check
this point eric

748
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:51,519
this point eric
 

749
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,189
this point eric
right so if there are two

750
00:15:55,189 --> 00:15:55,199
right so if there are two
 

751
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,590
right so if there are two
so that i have to count out i have to

752
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:57,600
so that i have to count out i have to
 

753
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,389
so that i have to count out i have to
check how

754
00:15:58,389 --> 00:15:58,399
check how
 

755
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,990
check how
what's the largest number of

756
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:02,000
what's the largest number of
 

757
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,550
what's the largest number of
what's the largest number of the most

758
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:04,560
what's the largest number of the most
 

759
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,350
what's the largest number of the most
common slope yeah so now we have the max

760
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:07,360
common slope yeah so now we have the max
 

761
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,389
common slope yeah so now we have the max
slows slow stop what

762
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:10,399
slows slow stop what
 

763
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,990
slows slow stop what
key or value

764
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:14,000

 

765
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,710

what's the key here key is the slope the

766
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:16,720
what's the key here key is the slope the
 

767
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,269
what's the key here key is the slope the
value is the number of the

768
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:19,279
value is the number of the
 

769
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,269
value is the number of the
time of the lines that have the same

770
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:21,279
time of the lines that have the same
 

771
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,230
time of the lines that have the same
slow right so is it key or values

772
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:24,240
slow right so is it key or values
 

773
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,829
slow right so is it key or values
yeah we're done values bracket

774
00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:27,839
yeah we're done values bracket
 

775
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,550
yeah we're done values bracket
and then return okay you tell me return

776
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:30,560
and then return okay you tell me return
 

777
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,670
and then return okay you tell me return
what

778
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:33,680

 

779
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,910

we also determine how many points so

780
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:35,920
we also determine how many points so
 

781
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,829
we also determine how many points so
return one

782
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:37,839
return one
 

783
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,790
return one
what's the value return answer what

784
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:40,800
what's the value return answer what
 

785
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,230
what's the value return answer what
value

786
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:42,240
value
 

787
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,350
value
answer is the value and remember the

788
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:45,360
answer is the value and remember the
 

789
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,310
answer is the value and remember the
answer if

790
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:46,320
answer if
 

791
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,829
answer if
if there are two points if there are one

792
00:16:48,829 --> 00:16:48,839
if there are two points if there are one
 

793
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:50,550
if there are two points if there are one
segment

794
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:50,560
segment
 

795
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,189
segment
one slow one slow too slow so how many

796
00:16:53,189 --> 00:16:53,199
one slow one slow too slow so how many
 

797
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:53,829
one slow one slow too slow so how many
points

798
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:53,839
points
 

799
00:16:53,839 --> 00:17:00,710
points
answer what

800
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:00,720

 

801
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,829

what

802
00:17:03,829 --> 00:17:03,839

 

803
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,870

plus one what this is the slope

804
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:06,880
plus one what this is the slope
 

805
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,630
plus one what this is the slope
that's one right and another point

806
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:08,640
that's one right and another point
 

807
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,309
that's one right and another point
another another line

808
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:10,319
another another line
 

809
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,350
another another line
two so how many points when the slope

810
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:13,360
two so how many points when the slope
 

811
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,870
two so how many points when the slope
stop value is two

812
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:14,880
stop value is two
 

813
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,429
stop value is two
yeah plus one that's what i mean yeah

814
00:17:17,429 --> 00:17:17,439
yeah plus one that's what i mean yeah
 

815
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:30,310
yeah plus one that's what i mean yeah
correct

816
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:30,320

 

817
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,990

because we are iterating the number of

818
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:32,000
because we are iterating the number of
 

819
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,669
because we are iterating the number of
pairs here i

820
00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:33,679
pairs here i
 

821
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,430
pairs here i
j right right i'm right

822
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:37,440
j right right i'm right
 

823
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,590
j right right i'm right
does it make sense

824
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:41,600

 

825
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,150

yeah okay so what's the space complexity

826
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:46,160
yeah okay so what's the space complexity
 

827
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:51,590
yeah okay so what's the space complexity
are we using any space um

828
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:51,600

 

829
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,190

we have a slope definer you see o n o

830
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:55,200
we have a slope definer you see o n o
 

831
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:04,630
we have a slope definer you see o n o
o n squared come on o n o n square

832
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:04,640

 

833
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,150

so we have an endpoint for each

834
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:08,160
so we have an endpoint for each
 

835
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,710
so we have an endpoint for each
for each pair for each point let's start

836
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:10,720
for each pair for each point let's start
 

837
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,470
for each pair for each point let's start
with this

838
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:12,480
with this
 

839
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,110
with this
and we have how many slopes the maximum

840
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:17,120
and we have how many slopes the maximum
 

841
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,510
and we have how many slopes the maximum
minus one well what minus one yeah

842
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:19,520
minus one well what minus one yeah
 

843
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,150
minus one well what minus one yeah
that's uh

844
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:20,160
that's uh
 

845
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,390
that's uh
definitely minus one yeah okay so what's

846
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:22,400
definitely minus one yeah okay so what's
 

847
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,909
definitely minus one yeah okay so what's
the thumb what's this based on residue

848
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:25,919
the thumb what's this based on residue
 

849
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,789
the thumb what's this based on residue
minus one yeah and what we don't need to

850
00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:28,799
minus one yeah and what we don't need to
 

851
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:29,909
minus one yeah and what we don't need to
line this one oh

852
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:29,919
line this one oh
 

853
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,510
line this one oh
oh what oh yes because look

854
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:33,520
oh what oh yes because look
 

855
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,470
oh what oh yes because look
the first loop is we pick we try every

856
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:36,480
the first loop is we pick we try every
 

857
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,430
the first loop is we pick we try every
point yeah

858
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:37,440
point yeah
 

859
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,909
point yeah
and at this point we find the line to

860
00:18:39,909 --> 00:18:39,919
and at this point we find the line to
 

861
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,750
and at this point we find the line to
the rest of the points

862
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:41,760
the rest of the points
 

863
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,470
the rest of the points
and how many as as long as they are

864
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:44,480
and how many as as long as they are
 

865
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,430
and how many as as long as they are
unique here

866
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:45,440
unique here
 

867
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,470
unique here
there will be n and minus one slow right

868
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:48,480
there will be n and minus one slow right
 

869
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,710
there will be n and minus one slow right
that's in the worst case so these slopes

870
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:50,720
that's in the worst case so these slopes
 

871
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,750
that's in the worst case so these slopes
contains

872
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:51,760
contains
 

873
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,510
contains
uh most at most and minus one

874
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:55,520
uh most at most and minus one
 

875
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,590
uh most at most and minus one
different values so that will be o n

876
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:57,600
different values so that will be o n
 

877
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,630
different values so that will be o n
right correct

878
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:00,640
right correct
 

879
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,830
right correct
all right okay can you tell me this one

880
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:03,840
all right okay can you tell me this one
 

881
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,630
all right okay can you tell me this one
come on how do you calculate the s slope

882
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:08,640
come on how do you calculate the s slope
 

883
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,710
come on how do you calculate the s slope
you don't need to worry about these two

884
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:10,720
you don't need to worry about these two
 

885
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,870
you don't need to worry about these two
why x equals one

886
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:12,880
why x equals one
 

887
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,310
why x equals one
what's the slope okay y equals

888
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:16,320
what's the slope okay y equals
 

889
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,669
what's the slope okay y equals
y equals k x plus b if i align

890
00:19:19,669 --> 00:19:19,679
y equals k x plus b if i align
 

891
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,150
y equals k x plus b if i align
drawing like that if i give you x what a

892
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:22,160
drawing like that if i give you x what a
 

893
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:22,789
drawing like that if i give you x what a
point here

894
00:19:22,789 --> 00:19:22,799
point here
 

895
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,710
point here
a point here what's the slope what's the

896
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:24,720
a point here what's the slope what's the
 

897
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,110
a point here what's the slope what's the
k value remember this

898
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:27,120
k value remember this
 

899
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,990
k value remember this
we can draw a triangle delta y divided

900
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:30,000
we can draw a triangle delta y divided
 

901
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,350
we can draw a triangle delta y divided
by delta x

902
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:31,360
by delta x
 

903
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:36,070
by delta x
so x equals one

904
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:36,080

 

905
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,750

think it's something like f so

906
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:39,760
think it's something like f so
 

907
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,470
think it's something like f so
i said delta y divided by delta x what's

908
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:42,480
i said delta y divided by delta x what's
 

909
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,110
i said delta y divided by delta x what's
theta y

910
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:45,120

 

911
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,150

um y y two minus y one right that's

912
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:48,160
um y y two minus y one right that's
 

913
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:48,870
um y y two minus y one right that's
theta y

914
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:48,880
theta y
 

915
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,230
theta y
come on y two minus y one

916
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:54,240

 

917
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,830

yeah minus y1

918
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:57,840
yeah minus y1
 

919
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:05,029
yeah minus y1
what y1

920
00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:05,039

 

921
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:09,669

okay and then divide it

922
00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:09,679
okay and then divide it
 

923
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,990
okay and then divide it
divided by what don't need to do

924
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:14,000
divided by what don't need to do
 

925
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,230
divided by what don't need to do
no no no not double because it's not

926
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:16,240
no no no not double because it's not
 

927
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,270
no no no not double because it's not
integer

928
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:17,280
integer
 

929
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,630
integer
right we want to get actually the

930
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:20,640
right we want to get actually the
 

931
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,430
right we want to get actually the
point yeah yeah yeah the floating point

932
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:23,440
point yeah yeah yeah the floating point
 

933
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,230
point yeah yeah yeah the floating point
yes

934
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:24,240
yes
 

935
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,590
yes
x yeah excellent two

936
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:27,600
x yeah excellent two
 

937
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,070
x yeah excellent two
yeah delta minus x times one

938
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:32,080
yeah delta minus x times one
 

939
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,270
yeah delta minus x times one
yeah if x2 not equals x1 right if

940
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:35,280
yeah if x2 not equals x1 right if
 

941
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,990
yeah if x2 not equals x1 right if
it's x2 equals x1 we want to assign the

942
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:38,000
it's x2 equals x1 we want to assign the
 

943
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,750
it's x2 equals x1 we want to assign the
slope as this infinity right

944
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:39,760
slope as this infinity right
 

945
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,710
slope as this infinity right
got it yeah okay the last question

946
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:42,720
got it yeah okay the last question
 

947
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,549
got it yeah okay the last question
what's the value of the

948
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:44,559
what's the value of the
 

949
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,350
what's the value of the
when what's the line of the slope equals

950
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:47,360
when what's the line of the slope equals
 

951
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,630
when what's the line of the slope equals
zero

952
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:48,640
zero
 

953
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,950
zero
what does it look like can you draw a

954
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:50,960
what does it look like can you draw a
 

955
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,070
what does it look like can you draw a
line what's that

956
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:52,080
line what's that
 

957
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,750
line what's that
equals now equals zero i asked you this

958
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:55,760
equals now equals zero i asked you this
 

959
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,029
equals now equals zero i asked you this
before

960
00:20:57,029 --> 00:20:57,039
before
 

961
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,590
before
i think it went like this yeah yeah yeah

962
00:20:59,590 --> 00:20:59,600
i think it went like this yeah yeah yeah
 

963
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,029
i think it went like this yeah yeah yeah
okay

964
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:01,039
okay
 

965
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,190
okay
yeah it's the horizontal line to the x

966
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:03,200
yeah it's the horizontal line to the x
 

967
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,870
yeah it's the horizontal line to the x
right yeah

968
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:04,880
right yeah
 

969
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,909
right yeah
correct yeah okay let that just makes

970
00:21:07,909 --> 00:21:07,919
correct yeah okay let that just makes
 

971
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,149
correct yeah okay let that just makes
make sense yeah so any two points yeah y

972
00:21:10,149 --> 00:21:10,159
make sense yeah so any two points yeah y
 

973
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:10,950
make sense yeah so any two points yeah y
equals k

974
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:10,960
equals k
 

975
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:18,230
equals k
x plus p what's the k come on what's k

976
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:18,240

 

977
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,789

what's the what's what do we call this k

978
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:22,799

 

979
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,149

slope okay key okay slope okay yeah and

980
00:21:26,149 --> 00:21:26,159
slope okay key okay slope okay yeah and
 

981
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,470
slope okay key okay slope okay yeah and
if let's take two lines have present

982
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:28,480
if let's take two lines have present
 

983
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,070
if let's take two lines have present
y equals two x plus one and y equals two

984
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:32,080
y equals two x plus one and y equals two
 

985
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,669
y equals two x plus one and y equals two
x plus two

986
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:33,679
x plus two
 

987
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:38,789
x plus two
what's the relation of these two lines

988
00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:38,799

 

989
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,390

yeah because they have the same tape

990
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:40,400
yeah because they have the same tape
 

991
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,149
yeah because they have the same tape
right same slope so you'll be

992
00:21:42,149 --> 00:21:42,159
right same slope so you'll be
 

993
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:43,909
right same slope so you'll be
something like that it will be parallel

994
00:21:43,909 --> 00:21:43,919
something like that it will be parallel
 

995
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,669
something like that it will be parallel
yeah okay yeah

996
00:21:45,669 --> 00:21:45,679
yeah okay yeah
 

997
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,990
yeah okay yeah
yeah that that's the most important

998
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:48,000
yeah that that's the most important
 

999
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,190
yeah that that's the most important
takeaway okay

1000
