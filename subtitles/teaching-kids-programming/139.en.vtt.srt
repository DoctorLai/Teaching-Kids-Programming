00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,470
go hello hello mr marion how are you
today

00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,590
today
good okay so can you remind me what is a

6
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:07,600
good okay so can you remind me what is a
 

7
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,390
good okay so can you remind me what is a
binary

8
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:08,400
binary
 

9
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,669
binary
search tree okay so on the left side

10
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:11,679
search tree okay so on the left side
 

11
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,470
search tree okay so on the left side
it just right now is such a it's like a

12
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:14,480
it just right now is such a it's like a
 

13
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:14,910
it just right now is such a it's like a
fun

14
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:14,920
fun
 

15
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,980
fun
fun

16
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:19,990

[Music]

18
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:25,680

 

19
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,390

okay i'll do

20
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:30,400
okay i'll do
 

21
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,910
okay i'll do
you don't need to draw that perfectly

22
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:31,920
you don't need to draw that perfectly
 

23
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,470
you don't need to draw that perfectly
just draw a roughly a binary search tree

24
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:34,480
just draw a roughly a binary search tree
 

25
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,110
just draw a roughly a binary search tree
okay

26
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:35,120
okay
 

27
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,190
okay
but the final research tree is a binary

28
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:37,200
but the final research tree is a binary
 

29
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,150
but the final research tree is a binary
tree right

30
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:38,160
tree right
 

31
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,229
tree right
but it has to be he has to satisfy

32
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:42,239
but it has to be he has to satisfy
 

33
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,270
but it has to be he has to satisfy
some requirements to be a binary search

34
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:45,280
some requirements to be a binary search
 

35
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,150
some requirements to be a binary search
tree

36
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:46,160
tree
 

37
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,190
tree
and the notes on the left hand side are

38
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:49,200
and the notes on the left hand side are
 

39
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,510
and the notes on the left hand side are
strictly smaller than the parent

40
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:51,520
strictly smaller than the parent
 

41
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,750
strictly smaller than the parent
and the notes on the right hand side on

42
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:53,760
and the notes on the right hand side on
 

43
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,270
and the notes on the right hand side on
the right subtree are

44
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:55,280
the right subtree are
 

45
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,470
the right subtree are
strictly bigger than the

46
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:58,480
strictly bigger than the
 

47
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,310
strictly bigger than the
parent right okay

48
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:02,320

 

49
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,670

and why why do we need a binary surgery

50
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:05,680
and why why do we need a binary surgery
 

51
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,149
and why why do we need a binary surgery
so in

52
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:06,159
so in
 

53
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,550
so in
what what travels the order does the

54
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:08,560
what what travels the order does the
 

55
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,390
what what travels the order does the
binary search tree

56
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:10,400
binary search tree
 

57
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,190
binary search tree
produce assorted order

58
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:15,200
produce assorted order
 

59
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,749
produce assorted order
saltiness uh yes that's very nice look

60
00:01:19,749 --> 00:01:19,759
saltiness uh yes that's very nice look
 

61
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,710
saltiness uh yes that's very nice look
this note even it's on the left hand

62
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:22,720
this note even it's on the left hand
 

63
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,429
this note even it's on the left hand
side

64
00:01:23,429 --> 00:01:23,439
side
 

65
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,350
side
but it has to be strictly larger than

66
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:25,360
but it has to be strictly larger than
 

67
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,190
but it has to be strictly larger than
the parent this parent right

68
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:27,200
the parent this parent right
 

69
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,069
the parent this parent right
it can't be like three if this is three

70
00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:30,079
it can't be like three if this is three
 

71
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:30,950
it can't be like three if this is three
it's not

72
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:30,960
it's not
 

73
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,670
it's not
but bst doesn't make sense even it's

74
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:33,680
but bst doesn't make sense even it's
 

75
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,749
but bst doesn't make sense even it's
smaller than a but it has to be bigger

76
00:01:35,749 --> 00:01:35,759
smaller than a but it has to be bigger
 

77
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:36,069
smaller than a but it has to be bigger
than

78
00:01:36,069 --> 00:01:36,079
than
 

79
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,190
than
five hey i mean i know yeah that's

80
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:39,200
five hey i mean i know yeah that's
 

81
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,870
five hey i mean i know yeah that's
that's right that's right yes

82
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:40,880
that's right that's right yes
 

83
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,749
that's right that's right yes
okay so what what what kind of order

84
00:01:43,749 --> 00:01:43,759
okay so what what what kind of order
 

85
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,510
okay so what what what kind of order
what we have what kind of order we have

86
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:45,520
what we have what kind of order we have
 

87
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,789
what we have what kind of order we have
in order pre-order and and

88
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:48,799
in order pre-order and and
 

89
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,670
in order pre-order and and
yeah professors is five to eight level

90
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:53,680
yeah professors is five to eight level
 

91
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,749
yeah professors is five to eight level
so which order produce a salted beast

92
00:01:57,749 --> 00:01:57,759
so which order produce a salted beast
 

93
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,990
so which order produce a salted beast
which order do we apply i mean if we

94
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:00,000
which order do we apply i mean if we
 

95
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,149
which order do we apply i mean if we
apply it to the binary surgery

96
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:02,159
apply it to the binary surgery
 

97
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,350
apply it to the binary surgery
we'll make a salty mist left

98
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:05,360
we'll make a salty mist left
 

99
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,550
we'll make a salty mist left
the one we've left tonight and

100
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:08,560
the one we've left tonight and
 

101
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,469
the one we've left tonight and
i know what what's that called i think

102
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:10,479
i know what what's that called i think
 

103
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,910
i know what what's that called i think
it's post

104
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:11,920
it's post
 

105
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,630
it's post
in order because the new note is in the

106
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:14,640
in order because the new note is in the
 

107
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,750
in order because the new note is in the
middle so let's

108
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:15,760
middle so let's
 

109
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,190
middle so let's
let's let's put in order so it's one

110
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:19,200
let's let's put in order so it's one
 

111
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,030
let's let's put in order so it's one
left note right right because look

112
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,040
left note right right because look
 

113
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,830
left note right right because look
left node is strictly smaller than loot

114
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:25,840
left node is strictly smaller than loot
 

115
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,630
left node is strictly smaller than loot
right

116
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:26,640
right
 

117
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,110
right
and the right now is strictly smaller

118
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:29,120
and the right now is strictly smaller
 

119
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,550
and the right now is strictly smaller
than the

120
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:30,560
than the
 

121
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,949
than the
metal root so if i go with this that's

122
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:32,959
metal root so if i go with this that's
 

123
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,070
metal root so if i go with this that's
in order yeah

124
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:34,080
in order yeah
 

125
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,390
in order yeah
in order in order because this is in the

126
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:36,400
in order in order because this is in the
 

127
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,070
in order in order because this is in the
middle if it's this in order let me

128
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:38,080
middle if it's this in order let me
 

129
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,670
middle if it's this in order let me
produce a sort of list right

130
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:39,680
produce a sort of list right
 

131
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,790
produce a sort of list right
am right does that make sense okay so

132
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:42,800
am right does that make sense okay so
 

133
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,350
am right does that make sense okay so
today we are given this final research

134
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:45,360
today we are given this final research
 

135
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,750
today we are given this final research
tree and i if i tell you

136
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:47,760
tree and i if i tell you
 

137
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,790
tree and i if i tell you
what's the successor you know successor

138
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:52,800

 

139
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,350

so the next one next one what's the

140
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:55,360
so the next one next one what's the
 

141
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,710
so the next one next one what's the
successor

142
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:56,720
successor
 

143
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,750
successor
if it if uh of the note

144
00:02:59,750 --> 00:02:59,760
if it if uh of the note
 

145
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,390
if it if uh of the note
for example if if i give you the node

146
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:02,400
for example if if i give you the node
 

147
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:02,869
for example if if i give you the node
five

148
00:03:02,869 --> 00:03:02,879
five
 

149
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,030
five
and you want i want you to tell i want

150
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,040
and you want i want you to tell i want
 

151
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,990
and you want i want you to tell i want
you to tell me that

152
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:06,000
you to tell me that
 

153
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,869
you to tell me that
the successor of five is eight right

154
00:03:08,869 --> 00:03:08,879
the successor of five is eight right
 

155
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:09,190
the successor of five is eight right
which

156
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:09,200
which
 

157
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,470
which
is the the smallest number

158
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:12,480
is the the smallest number
 

159
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,110
is the the smallest number
no no the success of the successor of

160
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:15,120
no no the success of the successor of
 

161
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,190
no no the success of the successor of
the

162
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:17,200
the
 

163
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,270
the
five is six sorry five is six

164
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:21,280
five is six sorry five is six
 

165
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,670
five is six sorry five is six
because it's it's in order

166
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:25,680
because it's it's in order
 

167
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,830
because it's it's in order
yeah it is what two five

168
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:29,840
yeah it is what two five
 

169
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,270
yeah it is what two five
six a right yeah let's start it so

170
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:33,280
six a right yeah let's start it so
 

171
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,710
six a right yeah let's start it so
let's try what's the other fact six okay

172
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:36,720
let's try what's the other fact six okay
 

173
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,509
let's try what's the other fact six okay
yeah that's all right so now

174
00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:41,519

 

175
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,110

yeah we're done that's a good question

176
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:43,120
yeah we're done that's a good question
 

177
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,630
yeah we're done that's a good question
you just written nothing no

178
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:44,640
you just written nothing no
 

179
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,869
you just written nothing no
you can't find anyone but let's yeah

180
00:03:46,869 --> 00:03:46,879
you can't find anyone but let's yeah
 

181
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:47,910
you can't find anyone but let's yeah
that's one

182
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:47,920
that's one
 

183
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,030
that's one
education good question so basically

184
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:51,040
education good question so basically
 

185
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,149
education good question so basically
you're finding

186
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:52,159
you're finding
 

187
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,190
you're finding
the large the smallest number

188
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:55,200
the large the smallest number
 

189
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,309
the large the smallest number
like is bigger than five right the

190
00:03:58,309 --> 00:03:58,319
like is bigger than five right the
 

191
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,110
like is bigger than five right the
successor

192
00:03:59,110 --> 00:03:59,120
successor
 

193
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,949
successor
of five is that i want you to find the

194
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:02,959
of five is that i want you to find the
 

195
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,350
of five is that i want you to find the
smallest number which is bigger than

196
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:05,360
smallest number which is bigger than
 

197
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,309
smallest number which is bigger than
five right

198
00:04:06,309 --> 00:04:06,319
five right
 

199
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,550
five right
so it's six not eight right because six

200
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:08,560
so it's six not eight right because six
 

201
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,309
so it's six not eight right because six
is smaller than eight which is

202
00:04:10,309 --> 00:04:10,319
is smaller than eight which is
 

203
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,429
is smaller than eight which is
these two are bigger than five do you

204
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:13,439
these two are bigger than five do you
 

205
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,630
these two are bigger than five do you
have a

206
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:14,640
have a
 

207
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:20,710
have a
i mean how do we solve this

208
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:20,720

 

209
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,749

in order yeah you know that yes

210
00:04:23,749 --> 00:04:23,759
in order yeah you know that yes
 

211
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,110
in order yeah you know that yes
and then you just do the next one over

212
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:27,120
and then you just do the next one over
 

213
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,670
and then you just do the next one over
thingy that's what i think so so yeah

214
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:31,680
thingy that's what i think so so yeah
 

215
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,030
thingy that's what i think so so yeah
we we can traverse by the final search

216
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:35,040
we we can traverse by the final search
 

217
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,350
we we can traverse by the final search
tree and then put all the nodes

218
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:37,360
tree and then put all the nodes
 

219
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,510
tree and then put all the nodes
in a list and then we look for the node

220
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:41,520
in a list and then we look for the node
 

221
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,990
in a list and then we look for the node
right the index usually in that song

222
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,000
right the index usually in that song
 

223
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,629
right the index usually in that song
here yeah

224
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:44,639
here yeah
 

225
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,550
here yeah
and then we return the next one right

226
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:46,560
and then we return the next one right
 

227
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,230
and then we return the next one right
does that make sense

228
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:48,240
does that make sense
 

229
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,189
does that make sense
yeah okay let's let's do this okay let's

230
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:51,199
yeah okay let's let's do this okay let's
 

231
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,790
yeah okay let's let's do this okay let's
do this

232
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:52,800
do this
 

233
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,070
do this
okay so define uh

234
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:56,080
okay so define uh
 

235
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,550
okay so define uh
in all the successor

236
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:00,560
in all the successor
 

237
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,469
in all the successor
and then loot i know we have a target

238
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:04,479
and then loot i know we have a target
 

239
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,590
and then loot i know we have a target
this is the this is the target good

240
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:07,600
this is the this is the target good
 

241
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,550
this is the this is the target good
good okay so yeah so now look we have a

242
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:10,560
good okay so yeah so now look we have a
 

243
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,310
good okay so yeah so now look we have a
list of us let's call it data

244
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:12,320
list of us let's call it data
 

245
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,430
list of us let's call it data
okay equals this yeah

246
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:15,440
okay equals this yeah
 

247
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,469
okay equals this yeah
yeah and then we do this define

248
00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:18,479
yeah and then we do this define
 

249
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,469
yeah and then we do this define
definition we define the function which

250
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:20,479
definition we define the function which
 

251
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:21,909
definition we define the function which
take a animal

252
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:21,919
take a animal
 

253
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,390
take a animal
that is tremendous the binaural street

254
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:24,400
that is tremendous the binaural street
 

255
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,510
that is tremendous the binaural street
okay look

256
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:25,520
okay look
 

257
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,189
okay look
if look is now

258
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:29,199
if look is now
 

259
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,909
if look is now
we just return yeah okay we can just

260
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:31,919
we just return yeah okay we can just
 

261
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,830
we just return yeah okay we can just
pretend

262
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:33,840
pretend
 

263
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,469
pretend
then then what we travel a lot we travel

264
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:36,479
then then what we travel a lot we travel
 

265
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:37,510
then then what we travel a lot we travel
uh

266
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:37,520
uh
 

267
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,830
uh
which number first the left note right

268
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:39,840
which number first the left note right
 

269
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,550
which number first the left note right
yes

270
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:40,560
yes
 

271
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,350
yes
so d f s one

272
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:45,360
so d f s one
 

273
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:51,510
so d f s one
and then what we travel the left

274
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:51,520

 

275
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,510

look is is recursive we are calling it

276
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:53,520
look is is recursive we are calling it
 

277
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,550
look is is recursive we are calling it
and what

278
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:54,560
and what
 

279
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,590
and what
what should we do we we add the the note

280
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:57,600
what should we do we we add the the note
 

281
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:03,430
what should we do we we add the the note
do the value data dot add

282
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:03,440

 

283
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,870

no append right a pen

284
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:06,880
no append right a pen
 

285
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,909
no append right a pen
apparently value yeah i want you i do

286
00:06:09,909 --> 00:06:09,919
apparently value yeah i want you i do
 

287
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,790
apparently value yeah i want you i do
after next

288
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:10,800
after next
 

289
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,070
after next
what should i do after the next

290
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,080

 

291
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,430

what should i remember i travel

292
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:17,440

 

293
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,790

no and now what should i do what's

294
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:18,800
no and now what should i do what's
 

295
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,950
no and now what should i do what's
missing here

296
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:20,960
missing here
 

297
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,590
missing here
what did i do i visited that i reached

298
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:23,600
what did i do i visited that i reached
 

299
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,189
what did i do i visited that i reached
the left tree i visited

300
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:25,199
the left tree i visited
 

301
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,670
the left tree i visited
i i put that note you visited the right

302
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:27,680
i i put that note you visited the right
 

303
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,230
i i put that note you visited the right
tree

304
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:28,240
tree
 

305
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,790
tree
yeah the way down

306
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:32,800

 

307
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,270

after that i have this data yeah this

308
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:35,280
after that i have this data yeah this
 

309
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,629
after that i have this data yeah this
data thing yeah

310
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:36,639
data thing yeah
 

311
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,830
data thing yeah
yes yeah let's take that thingy

312
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:39,840
yes yeah let's take that thingy
 

313
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,710
yes yeah let's take that thingy
uh i think i have to put this non-local

314
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:42,720
uh i think i have to put this non-local
 

315
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,309
uh i think i have to put this non-local
thing remember

316
00:06:44,309 --> 00:06:44,319
thing remember
 

317
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,150
thing remember
yeah because this is not in the scope i

318
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:46,160
yeah because this is not in the scope i
 

319
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,390
yeah because this is not in the scope i
have to reference it here right

320
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:48,400
have to reference it here right
 

321
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,309
have to reference it here right
and then here i have say the mspfs

322
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:52,319
and then here i have say the mspfs
 

323
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,029
and then here i have say the mspfs
load okay and after that data will

324
00:06:55,029 --> 00:06:55,039
load okay and after that data will
 

325
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:55,830
load okay and after that data will
contain the

326
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:55,840
contain the
 

327
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,230
contain the
sorted resulting list right yeah and

328
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:58,240
sorted resulting list right yeah and
 

329
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,309
sorted resulting list right yeah and
then now what do i do and then look

330
00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:00,319
then now what do i do and then look
 

331
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,070
then now what do i do and then look
i will have this i equals

332
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:04,080
i will have this i equals
 

333
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,710
i will have this i equals
theta dot i find it look index

334
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:08,720
theta dot i find it look index
 

335
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,749
theta dot i find it look index
i find the index of the t

336
00:07:11,749 --> 00:07:11,759
i find the index of the t
 

337
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,870
i find the index of the t
right yes then if i

338
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:14,880
right yes then if i
 

339
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,670
right yes then if i
is smaller than length theta yeah if

340
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:17,680
is smaller than length theta yeah if
 

341
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,430
is smaller than length theta yeah if
there is a

342
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:19,440
there is a
 

343
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,550
there is a
if it's the in the smallest data i

344
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:22,560
if it's the in the smallest data i
 

345
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,790
if it's the in the smallest data i
then plot minus one yeah because we if

346
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:24,800
then plot minus one yeah because we if
 

347
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,309
then plot minus one yeah because we if
it's not the

348
00:07:26,309 --> 00:07:26,319
it's not the
 

349
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,430
it's not the
second to the next and i can return one

350
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:29,440
second to the next and i can return one
 

351
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,589
second to the next and i can return one
return theta

352
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:33,599
return theta
 

353
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,950
return theta
i will return the i plus one right yeah

354
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:36,960
i will return the i plus one right yeah
 

355
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,790
i will return the i plus one right yeah
because this is the next one yeah what's

356
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:38,800
because this is the next one yeah what's
 

357
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,830
because this is the next one yeah what's
the time complexity

358
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:42,840

 

359
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,830

what and something yes

360
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:45,840
what and something yes
 

361
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,749
what and something yes
because we're traversing the final

362
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:47,759
because we're traversing the final
 

363
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,350
because we're traversing the final
street if there are n notes there will

364
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:49,360
street if there are n notes there will
 

365
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,550
street if there are n notes there will
be

366
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:50,560
be
 

367
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,510
be
n times i i have to visit the nodes each

368
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:53,520
n times i i have to visit the nodes each
 

369
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,950
n times i i have to visit the nodes each
node and put it in the data

370
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:54,960
node and put it in the data
 

371
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:01,909
node and put it in the data
list there what's the space complexity

372
00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:01,919

 

373
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,029

can we can we do it better i mean if if

374
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:05,039
can we can we do it better i mean if if
 

375
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,029
can we can we do it better i mean if if
if the binary search tree is highly

376
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:07,039
if the binary search tree is highly
 

377
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,950
if the binary search tree is highly
balanced okay it's very balanced still

378
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:08,960
balanced okay it's very balanced still
 

379
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,189
balanced okay it's very balanced still
on right because we have to visit

380
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:11,199
on right because we have to visit
 

381
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,309
on right because we have to visit
exactly at

382
00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:12,319
exactly at
 

383
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,869
exactly at
every node in the binary search tree we

384
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:14,879
every node in the binary search tree we
 

385
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:15,670
every node in the binary search tree we
don't

386
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:15,680
don't
 

387
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,510
don't
use the fact that the left nodes are

388
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:17,520
use the fact that the left nodes are
 

389
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,189
use the fact that the left nodes are
smaller this then

390
00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:19,199
smaller this then
 

391
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,670
smaller this then
yeah the the note and the right notes

392
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:21,680
yeah the the note and the right notes
 

393
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,469
yeah the the note and the right notes
are bigger than

394
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:22,479
are bigger than
 

395
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,589
are bigger than
that right we have to visit all at once

396
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:25,599
that right we have to visit all at once
 

397
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,350
that right we have to visit all at once
can we do better we can

398
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:29,360
can we do better we can
 

399
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,469
can we do better we can
maybe we can okay so so

400
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:32,479
maybe we can okay so so
 

401
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,709
maybe we can okay so so
this is clear yeah eric this is clear

402
00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:34,719
this is clear yeah eric this is clear
 

403
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,070
this is clear yeah eric this is clear
yeah

404
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:36,080
yeah
 

405
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,269
yeah
look if if ice we find a t the index of

406
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:39,279
look if if ice we find a t the index of
 

407
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,149
look if if ice we find a t the index of
t

408
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:40,159
t
 

409
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,190
t
if it's next one if i plus one is still

410
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:43,200
if it's next one if i plus one is still
 

411
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,070
if it's next one if i plus one is still
then smaller than the length theta then

412
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:46,080
then smaller than the length theta then
 

413
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,030
then smaller than the length theta then
we can return the

414
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,040
we can return the
 

415
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,230
we can return the
next one right otherwise if this doesn't

416
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:50,240
next one right otherwise if this doesn't
 

417
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,550
next one right otherwise if this doesn't
if this if condition doesn't satisfy

418
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:52,560
if this if condition doesn't satisfy
 

419
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,230
if this if condition doesn't satisfy
what does it mean

420
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:54,240
what does it mean
 

421
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,630
what does it mean
what does it mean it means that

422
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:58,640
what does it mean it means that
 

423
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,550
what does it mean it means that
it means what it's the which of which

424
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:00,560
it means what it's the which of which
 

425
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,310
it means what it's the which of which
element and you can't find the next one

426
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:02,320
element and you can't find the next one
 

427
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,269
element and you can't find the next one
which element

428
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:03,279
which element
 

429
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,110
which element
the last one yeah if it's the last one

430
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:05,120
the last one yeah if it's the last one
 

431
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,710
the last one yeah if it's the last one
it doesn't go in there right because if

432
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:06,720
it doesn't go in there right because if
 

433
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,990
it doesn't go in there right because if
the last one theta i plus

434
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:08,000
the last one theta i plus
 

435
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,110
the last one theta i plus
one is out of boundary you can't find i

436
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:11,120
one is out of boundary you can't find i
 

437
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,150
one is out of boundary you can't find i
plus one right

438
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:12,160
plus one right
 

439
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,110
plus one right
yes doesn't make sense look this in this

440
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:15,120
yes doesn't make sense look this in this
 

441
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,310
yes doesn't make sense look this in this
array

442
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:16,320
array
 

443
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,870
array
uh is one two three right four is

444
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:18,880
uh is one two three right four is
 

445
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,430
uh is one two three right four is
exactly okay

446
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:21,440
exactly okay
 

447
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:27,509
exactly okay
zero is what are zero is one

448
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:27,519

 

449
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,670

one yeah and ar one is one

450
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:31,680
one yeah and ar one is one
 

451
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,269
one yeah and ar one is one
two ah three is one i don't know

452
00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:35,279
two ah three is one i don't know
 

453
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:40,550
two ah three is one i don't know
two is one are you gonna ask me

454
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:40,560
two is one are you gonna ask me
 

455
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,870
two is one are you gonna ask me
no no it would be the computer will

456
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:42,880
no no it would be the computer will
 

457
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,150
no no it would be the computer will
complain

458
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:44,160
complain
 

459
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,470
complain
because look ar only has three elements

460
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:46,480
because look ar only has three elements
 

461
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,630
because look ar only has three elements
you're asking for the fourth

462
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:48,640
you're asking for the fourth
 

463
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,110
you're asking for the fourth
okay and then that would be a runtime

464
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:51,120
okay and then that would be a runtime
 

465
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,990
okay and then that would be a runtime
error

466
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:52,000
error
 

467
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,269
error
so the computer will complain and and

468
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:55,279
so the computer will complain and and
 

469
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,110
so the computer will complain and and
we are throwing exception and then you

470
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,120
we are throwing exception and then you
 

471
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,630
we are throwing exception and then you
left you can't do that

472
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:58,640
left you can't do that
 

473
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,630
left you can't do that
okay there's a problem there's a bug

474
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:00,640
okay there's a problem there's a bug
 

475
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,829
okay there's a problem there's a bug
yeah doesn't make sense

476
00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:01,839
yeah doesn't make sense
 

477
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,150
yeah doesn't make sense
so that's why we have to check if if i

478
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:04,160
so that's why we have to check if if i
 

479
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,310
so that's why we have to check if if i
plus one is smaller it's still within

480
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:06,320
plus one is smaller it's still within
 

481
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,430
plus one is smaller it's still within
the boundary

482
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:07,440
the boundary
 

483
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,509
the boundary
then i can return the next one right

484
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:09,519
then i can return the next one right
 

485
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,509
then i can return the next one right
otherwise it's the last element and we

486
00:10:11,509 --> 00:10:11,519
otherwise it's the last element and we
 

487
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,069
otherwise it's the last element and we
can

488
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:12,079
can
 

489
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,110
can
we can find the successor okay we can't

490
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:15,120
we can find the successor okay we can't
 

491
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,829
we can find the successor okay we can't
find the

492
00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:15,839
find the
 

493
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,750
find the
smallest element that is larger

494
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:19,760
smallest element that is larger
 

495
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,949
smallest element that is larger
than the last element right yeah

496
00:10:22,949 --> 00:10:22,959
than the last element right yeah
 

497
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,069
than the last element right yeah
okay so another agreement

498
00:10:26,069 --> 00:10:26,079
okay so another agreement
 

499
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:30,829
okay so another agreement
another angle look look let's do this

500
00:10:30,829 --> 00:10:30,839

 

501
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,590

two

502
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:33,600
two
 

503
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,710
two
one

504
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:36,720

 

505
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,910

four three okay

506
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:39,920
four three okay
 

507
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,990
four three okay
this is the final first three right yeah

508
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:42,000
this is the final first three right yeah
 

509
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,630
this is the final first three right yeah
what can you do

510
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:44,640
what can you do
 

511
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,150
what can you do
oh you can do three or four it's the

512
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:46,160
oh you can do three or four it's the
 

513
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,990
oh you can do three or four it's the
same yeah

514
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:48,000
same yeah
 

515
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,590
same yeah
you know that would be what zero one

516
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:51,600
you know that would be what zero one
 

517
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,030
you know that would be what zero one
two three four yeah okay

518
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,040
two three four yeah okay
 

519
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,829
two three four yeah okay
zero one three it's a thought

520
00:10:58,829 --> 00:10:58,839
zero one three it's a thought
 

521
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:02,150
zero one three it's a thought
so look if i just tell you if i want to

522
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:02,160
so look if i just tell you if i want to
 

523
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,150
so look if i just tell you if i want to
look for number two

524
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:04,160
look for number two
 

525
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,110
look for number two
it will be number four yeah yeah i know

526
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:07,120
it will be number four yeah yeah i know
 

527
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,110
it will be number four yeah yeah i know
if i want to look for number four

528
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:09,120
if i want to look for number four
 

529
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,829
if i want to look for number four
for example okay i want to find the

530
00:11:11,829 --> 00:11:11,839
for example okay i want to find the
 

531
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:20,710
for example okay i want to find the
success that

532
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:20,720

 

533
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,590

next to one zero there will be one right

534
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:23,600
next to one zero there will be one right
 

535
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,590
next to one zero there will be one right
okay so

536
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:25,600
okay so
 

537
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,190
okay so
if one is zero smaller than two

538
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:29,200
if one is zero smaller than two
 

539
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,710
if one is zero smaller than two
yeah yeah i go this way yeah is zero

540
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:32,720
yeah yeah i go this way yeah is zero
 

541
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,829
yeah yeah i go this way yeah is zero
is ecl smaller than zero

542
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:35,839
is ecl smaller than zero
 

543
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,590
is ecl smaller than zero
no no i go to the low right so

544
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:39,600
no no i go to the low right so
 

545
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,310
no no i go to the low right so
what does it mean it means that what

546
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:42,320
what does it mean it means that what
 

547
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,670
what does it mean it means that what
does it mean

548
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:45,680

 

549
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,430

look if so we can we when we are given

550
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:49,440
look if so we can we when we are given
 

551
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,230
look if so we can we when we are given
this t

552
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:50,240
this t
 

553
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,590
this t
we can traverse the tree by comparing

554
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:53,600
we can traverse the tree by comparing
 

555
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,350
we can traverse the tree by comparing
the value to that node yeah

556
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:55,360
the value to that node yeah
 

557
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,470
the value to that node yeah
when the value is smaller when this

558
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:58,480
when the value is smaller when this
 

559
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,949
when the value is smaller when this
value is smaller than the root value

560
00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:00,959
value is smaller than the root value
 

561
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,430
value is smaller than the root value
like if i want to find it zero and then

562
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:03,440
like if i want to find it zero and then
 

563
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,069
like if i want to find it zero and then
i i

564
00:12:04,069 --> 00:12:04,079
i i
 

565
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,110
i i
will update the answer the note

566
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:07,120
will update the answer the note
 

567
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:19,350
will update the answer the note
because look if if i

568
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:19,360

 

569
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,870

this is the answer we're looking for

570
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:20,880
this is the answer we're looking for
 

571
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,990
this is the answer we're looking for
right at the beginning it's none right

572
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:24,000
right at the beginning it's none right
 

573
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,350
right at the beginning it's none right
yeah and this target t is

574
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:27,360
yeah and this target t is
 

575
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,750
yeah and this target t is
equal to zero right it's the number

576
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:29,760
equal to zero right it's the number
 

577
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,910
equal to zero right it's the number
where we are trying to find like next

578
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:31,920
where we are trying to find like next
 

579
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,550
where we are trying to find like next
bigger than t the smallest number bigger

580
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:34,560
bigger than t the smallest number bigger
 

581
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,150
bigger than t the smallest number bigger
than t which is one right

582
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:36,160
than t which is one right
 

583
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,509
than t which is one right
okay so if t is smaller than the lude is

584
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:39,519
okay so if t is smaller than the lude is
 

585
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:40,470
okay so if t is smaller than the lude is
here right

586
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:40,480
here right
 

587
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,750
here right
yeah it's smaller than 2 so

588
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:43,760
yeah it's smaller than 2 so
 

589
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,269
yeah it's smaller than 2 so
i should i should update the answer to

590
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:47,279
i should i should update the answer to
 

591
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:51,030
i should i should update the answer to
2 and go to the left why is that because

592
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:51,040
2 and go to the left why is that because
 

593
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,949
2 and go to the left why is that because
if if this number is smaller than 2

594
00:12:54,949 --> 00:12:54,959
if if this number is smaller than 2
 

595
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,470
if if this number is smaller than 2
then 2 is bigger than

596
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:58,480

 

597
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,310

the 2 is bigger than the answer right

598
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:00,320
the 2 is bigger than the answer right
 

599
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,750
the 2 is bigger than the answer right
all right

600
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:01,760
all right
 

601
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,230
all right
yeah look look you need to think about

602
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:04,240
yeah look look you need to think about
 

603
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,430
yeah look look you need to think about
these logic okay

604
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:05,440
these logic okay
 

605
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,430
these logic okay
if if if this number if this number we

606
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:09,440
if if if this number if this number we
 

607
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,310
if if if this number if this number we
are looking for

608
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:10,320
are looking for
 

609
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,910
are looking for
t is smaller than a 2 so

610
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:13,920
t is smaller than a 2 so
 

611
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,870
t is smaller than a 2 so
so 2 is is bigger than the t is bigger

612
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:16,880
so 2 is is bigger than the t is bigger
 

613
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,350
so 2 is is bigger than the t is bigger
than t

614
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:17,360
than t
 

615
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,710
than t
right right so we we set this to answer

616
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:20,720
right right so we we set this to answer
 

617
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,389
right right so we we set this to answer
to two now because we're gonna find a

618
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:22,399
to two now because we're gonna find a
 

619
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,870
to two now because we're gonna find a
number which is bigger than t

620
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:24,880
number which is bigger than t
 

621
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,310
number which is bigger than t
doesn't make sense so i go here okay is

622
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:28,320
doesn't make sense so i go here okay is
 

623
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,629
doesn't make sense so i go here okay is
if zero is smaller than zero

624
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:32,639
if zero is smaller than zero
 

625
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,150
if zero is smaller than zero
no no i go to the right right then i

626
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:36,160
no no i go to the right right then i
 

627
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,470
no no i go to the right right then i
i don't get it i don't i don't need to

628
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:38,480
i don't get it i don't i don't need to
 

629
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,150
i don't get it i don't i don't need to
do anything but look

630
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:40,160
do anything but look
 

631
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,230
do anything but look
if zero is smaller than

632
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:44,240
if zero is smaller than
 

633
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,710
if zero is smaller than
one yes smaller than one so i

634
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:48,720
one yes smaller than one so i
 

635
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,829
one yes smaller than one so i
every time it's smaller i i update it to

636
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:51,839
every time it's smaller i i update it to
 

637
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,069
every time it's smaller i i update it to
this right and i go to the right left

638
00:13:54,069 --> 00:13:54,079
this right and i go to the right left
 

639
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:55,509
this right and i go to the right left
which is not nothing and

640
00:13:55,509 --> 00:13:55,519
which is not nothing and
 

641
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,550
which is not nothing and
i end it so look the answer is one yeah

642
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:58,560
i end it so look the answer is one yeah
 

643
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,590
i end it so look the answer is one yeah
does that make sense yeah when you go to

644
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:01,600
does that make sense yeah when you go to
 

645
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,790
does that make sense yeah when you go to
the left

646
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:02,800
the left
 

647
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,430
the left
what does it mean it means that the root

648
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:05,440
what does it mean it means that the root
 

649
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,030
what does it mean it means that the root
the current node

650
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:07,040
the current node
 

651
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,949
the current node
is bigger than the value you're looking

652
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:08,959
is bigger than the value you're looking
 

653
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,150
is bigger than the value you're looking
for then

654
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:10,160
for then
 

655
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,069
for then
it's possibly the answer right it's

656
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:12,079
it's possibly the answer right it's
 

657
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,910
it's possibly the answer right it's
possibly answer i have to update the

658
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:13,920
possibly answer i have to update the
 

659
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,030
possibly answer i have to update the
answer what happens

660
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:15,040
answer what happens
 

661
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,829
answer what happens
is we read the answer if you do the

662
00:14:17,829 --> 00:14:17,839
is we read the answer if you do the
 

663
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,750
is we read the answer if you do the
answer okay how about

664
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:19,760
answer okay how about
 

665
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,670
answer okay how about
uh okay so good question how about if i

666
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:23,680
uh okay so good question how about if i
 

667
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,910
uh okay so good question how about if i
put zero and then i erase that one thing

668
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:25,920
put zero and then i erase that one thing
 

669
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,710
put zero and then i erase that one thing
okay

670
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:26,720
okay
 

671
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,710
okay
okay at the beginning we are still

672
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:28,720
okay at the beginning we are still
 

673
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,990
okay at the beginning we are still
looking for zero which is

674
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,000
looking for zero which is
 

675
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,189
looking for zero which is
the next one will be two right yeah if

676
00:14:33,189 --> 00:14:33,199
the next one will be two right yeah if
 

677
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,990
the next one will be two right yeah if
zero is smaller than two yeah yes then

678
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:36,000
zero is smaller than two yeah yes then
 

679
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,629
zero is smaller than two yeah yes then
it means two is bigger than zero right

680
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:38,639
it means two is bigger than zero right
 

681
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,389
it means two is bigger than zero right
yeah and then that absolute answer this

682
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:40,399
yeah and then that absolute answer this
 

683
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,230
yeah and then that absolute answer this
is the candidate it doesn't mean

684
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:42,240
is the candidate it doesn't mean
 

685
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,069
is the candidate it doesn't mean
it's a final answer right it just means

686
00:14:44,069 --> 00:14:44,079
it's a final answer right it just means
 

687
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,150
it's a final answer right it just means
that two is bigger than t

688
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:46,160
that two is bigger than t
 

689
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,829
that two is bigger than t
but we are not sure if it's the smallest

690
00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:47,839
but we are not sure if it's the smallest
 

691
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,550
but we are not sure if it's the smallest
right okay now i go to the left

692
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:50,560
right okay now i go to the left
 

693
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,150
right okay now i go to the left
okay is zero smaller than zero

694
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:54,160
okay is zero smaller than zero
 

695
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,350
okay is zero smaller than zero
no i go to the right which ends nothing

696
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:57,360
no i go to the right which ends nothing
 

697
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,189
no i go to the right which ends nothing
ends and then the answer is two

698
00:14:59,189 --> 00:14:59,199
ends and then the answer is two
 

699
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,590
ends and then the answer is two
the last one yeah okay so we try another

700
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:01,600
the last one yeah okay so we try another
 

701
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,870
the last one yeah okay so we try another
example like

702
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:02,880
example like
 

703
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,310
example like
what happens one there sorry which one

704
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:06,320
what happens one there sorry which one
 

705
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,590
what happens one there sorry which one
it is okay

706
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:09,600
it is okay
 

707
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,670
it is okay
let's be somebody just i just show you

708
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:11,680
let's be somebody just i just show you
 

709
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,949
let's be somebody just i just show you
right remember yeah

710
00:15:12,949 --> 00:15:12,959
right remember yeah
 

711
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,030
right remember yeah
how about let's take this example three

712
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:15,040
how about let's take this example three
 

713
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,150
how about let's take this example three
three and then

714
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:16,160
three and then
 

715
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,230
three and then
you give me the answer for right yeah

716
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:18,240
you give me the answer for right yeah
 

717
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,629
you give me the answer for right yeah
let's let's do this number three

718
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:20,639
let's let's do this number three
 

719
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,110
let's let's do this number three
the at the beginning is nothing is three

720
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:23,120
the at the beginning is nothing is three
 

721
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,230
the at the beginning is nothing is three
bigger than two

722
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:24,240
bigger than two
 

723
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,870
bigger than two
smaller than two nine go to the right

724
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:26,880
smaller than two nine go to the right
 

725
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,949
smaller than two nine go to the right
when you go to the right you do nothing

726
00:15:28,949 --> 00:15:28,959
when you go to the right you do nothing
 

727
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,749
when you go to the right you do nothing
what is three smaller than four yeah

728
00:15:31,749 --> 00:15:31,759
what is three smaller than four yeah
 

729
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:32,230
what is three smaller than four yeah
yeah

730
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:32,240
yeah
 

731
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,790
yeah
i go to the left but i also update the

732
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:34,800
i go to the left but i also update the
 

733
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,150
i go to the left but i also update the
answer to four right

734
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:36,160
answer to four right
 

735
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,230
answer to four right
because four is bigger than three it's

736
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:38,240
because four is bigger than three it's
 

737
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,269
because four is bigger than three it's
possibly one them

738
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:39,279
possibly one them
 

739
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,269
possibly one them
right okay it's three smaller than three

740
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:43,279
right okay it's three smaller than three
 

741
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:47,110
right okay it's three smaller than three
i go no and i i just go right

742
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:47,120
i go no and i i just go right
 

743
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,590
i go no and i i just go right
and and let's let's end it and the

744
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:49,600
and and let's let's end it and the
 

745
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,189
and and let's let's end it and the
answer is well doesn't make sense

746
00:15:51,189 --> 00:15:51,199
answer is well doesn't make sense
 

747
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,310
answer is well doesn't make sense
yeah okay so it's a bit tricky right but

748
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:54,320
yeah okay so it's a bit tricky right but
 

749
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,350
yeah okay so it's a bit tricky right but
it works yeah

750
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:55,360
it works yeah
 

751
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,430
it works yeah
it's a bit tricky right so the thing is

752
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:57,440
it's a bit tricky right so the thing is
 

753
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,870
it's a bit tricky right so the thing is
that when you turn to the right when you

754
00:15:58,870 --> 00:15:58,880
that when you turn to the right when you
 

755
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,509
that when you turn to the right when you
compare

756
00:15:59,509 --> 00:15:59,519
compare
 

757
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,069
compare
10 to the right it also means that the

758
00:16:02,069 --> 00:16:02,079
10 to the right it also means that the
 

759
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:03,509
10 to the right it also means that the
load

760
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:03,519
load
 

761
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,509
load
is possibly one of the answer right

762
00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:05,519
is possibly one of the answer right
 

763
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:06,949
is possibly one of the answer right
because it's bigger than the thing

764
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:06,959
because it's bigger than the thing
 

765
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:07,990
because it's bigger than the thing
you're looking for

766
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:08,000
you're looking for
 

767
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,069
you're looking for
but we are not sure if it's the smallest

768
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:10,079
but we are not sure if it's the smallest
 

769
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:11,030
but we are not sure if it's the smallest
right

770
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:11,040
right
 

771
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,230
right
then we keep visiting we keep updating

772
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:14,240
then we keep visiting we keep updating
 

773
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,670
then we keep visiting we keep updating
right when you go to the right you do

774
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:15,680
right when you go to the right you do
 

775
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,509
right when you go to the right you do
nothing when you go to the left

776
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:17,519
nothing when you go to the left
 

777
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,350
nothing when you go to the left
you you are you are

778
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:21,360
you you are you are
 

779
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,389
you you are you are
making you you are towards in your air

780
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:24,399
making you you are towards in your air
 

781
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:25,829
making you you are towards in your air
towards the answer right

782
00:16:25,829 --> 00:16:25,839
towards the answer right
 

783
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,470
towards the answer right
because you are you are making these

784
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:28,480
because you are you are making these
 

785
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,910
because you are you are making these
answers smaller right

786
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:29,920
answers smaller right
 

787
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,269
answers smaller right
yeah right when you go to the left

788
00:16:33,269 --> 00:16:33,279
yeah right when you go to the left
 

789
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,430
yeah right when you go to the left
it's bigger than the answer but we

790
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:35,440
it's bigger than the answer but we
 

791
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,749
it's bigger than the answer but we
smaller so we are getting close

792
00:16:37,749 --> 00:16:37,759
smaller so we are getting close
 

793
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,870
smaller so we are getting close
to the final answer in this way yeah

794
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:40,880
to the final answer in this way yeah
 

795
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,470
to the final answer in this way yeah
define okay look answer yeah equals

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,110
it's bigger if it's not smaller what
else should i do

828
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:51,120
else should i do
 

829
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,190
else should i do
low equals root or what we do

830
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:55,200
low equals root or what we do
 

831
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,669
low equals root or what we do
yeah we're done and then what's missing

832
00:17:57,669 --> 00:17:57,679
yeah we're done and then what's missing
 

833
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:03,190
yeah we're done and then what's missing
return what

834
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:03,200

 

835
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,909

okay you see this is shorter right

836
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:05,919
okay you see this is shorter right
 

837
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,190
okay you see this is shorter right
compared to the previous one the

838
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:07,200
compared to the previous one the
 

839
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,950
compared to the previous one the
definition right remember you still

840
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:08,960
definition right remember you still
 

841
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,070
definition right remember you still
remember yeah

842
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:10,080
remember yeah
 

843
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:20,789
remember yeah
what's the term complexity

844
00:18:20,789 --> 00:18:20,799

 

845
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,150

yes and what's h equals you can say o h

846
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:24,160
yes and what's h equals you can say o h
 

847
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:29,110
yes and what's h equals you can say o h
and h equals one if it's a balance

848
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:29,120
and h equals one if it's a balance
 

849
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,430
and h equals one if it's a balance
if it's a highly balanced finance stream

850
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:31,440
if it's a highly balanced finance stream
 

851
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,350
if it's a highly balanced finance stream
what's h

852
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:33,360
what's h
 

853
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,990
what's h
o h h is the height you can say okay and

854
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:36,000
o h h is the height you can say okay and
 

855
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,270
o h h is the height you can say okay and
also if i want to say

856
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:37,280
also if i want to say
 

857
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,190
also if i want to say
n is the number of the nodes in the load

858
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:39,200
n is the number of the nodes in the load
 

859
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,830
n is the number of the nodes in the load
one

860
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:40,840
one
 

861
00:18:40,840 --> 00:19:04,310
one
and

862
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:04,320

 

863
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,669

how many notes are there uh

864
00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:07,679
how many notes are there uh
 

865
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,630
how many notes are there uh
seven seven notes okay height is worth

866
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:10,640
seven seven notes okay height is worth
 

867
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,830
seven seven notes okay height is worth
three yeah yeah

868
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:11,840
three yeah yeah
 

869
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,870
three yeah yeah
high equals three and no equals seven so

870
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:14,880
high equals three and no equals seven so
 

871
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,510
high equals three and no equals seven so
it's roughly eight okay so log

872
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:17,520
it's roughly eight okay so log
 

873
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,789
it's roughly eight okay so log
log eight which is three all right does

874
00:19:20,789 --> 00:19:20,799
log eight which is three all right does
 

875
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:21,990
log eight which is three all right does
it make sense

876
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:22,000
it make sense
 

877
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,710
it make sense
yeah because look 2 to the power 0 2 to

878
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:24,720
yeah because look 2 to the power 0 2 to
 

879
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,390
yeah because look 2 to the power 0 2 to
the power 1 2 to the power 3.

880
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:26,400
the power 1 2 to the power 3.
 

881
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,390
the power 1 2 to the power 3.
in the reverse it will be locked right

882
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:28,400
in the reverse it will be locked right
 

883
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,909
in the reverse it will be locked right
that's why in the final

884
00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:29,919
that's why in the final
 

885
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,070
that's why in the final
3 when you are every time look every

886
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:32,080
3 when you are every time look every
 

887
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,310
3 when you are every time look every
time i go to the left or right

888
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:34,320
time i go to the left or right
 

889
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,230
time i go to the left or right
right so every time i cut i

890
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:38,240
right so every time i cut i
 

891
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,710
right so every time i cut i
i abandoned another half right am right

892
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:42,720
i abandoned another half right am right
 

893
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,909
i abandoned another half right am right
so every time i abandon half so let's

894
00:19:45,909 --> 00:19:45,919
so every time i abandon half so let's
 

895
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:46,549
so every time i abandon half so let's
lock

896
00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:46,559
lock
 

897
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,669
lock
lock n does it make sense or you can say

898
00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:49,679
lock n does it make sense or you can say
 

899
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:49,990
lock n does it make sense or you can say
o

900
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:50,000
o
 

901
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,270
o
o h because h is the height does it make

902
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:53,280
o h because h is the height does it make
 

903
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,070
o h because h is the height does it make
sense

904
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:54,080
sense
 

905
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,590
sense
what's the space complexity i uh

906
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:57,600
what's the space complexity i uh
 

907
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,549
what's the space complexity i uh
oh what come on do we use any space here

908
00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:00,559
oh what come on do we use any space here
 

909
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:01,510
oh what come on do we use any space here
one

00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:09,840
previous one we have a list right
 

919
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,669
previous one we have a list right
i'll answer this that's why it's aware

we go to the left or right left yeah
 

955
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,830
we go to the left or right left yeah
because it's smaller we go to the left

956
00:20:59,830 --> 00:20:59,840
because it's smaller we go to the left
 

957
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:18,870
because it's smaller we go to the left
bigger go to the right yeah

958
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:18,880

 

959
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:25,840

okay that's it for today
