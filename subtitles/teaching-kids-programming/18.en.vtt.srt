00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,150

hello

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:06,160

 

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,430

hello hello guys

4
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:09,440
hello hello guys
 

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,310
hello hello guys
hello everyone ryan hello hello guys

6
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:12,320
hello everyone ryan hello hello guys
 

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,270
hello everyone ryan hello hello guys
okay so today

8
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:13,280
okay so today
 

9
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,990
okay so today
we'll talk about the something that's

10
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:16,000
we'll talk about the something that's
 

11
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,870
we'll talk about the something that's
very interesting

12
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:16,880
very interesting
 

13
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,340
very interesting
is called equilibrium

14
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:19,350
is called equilibrium
 

15
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,630
is called equilibrium

complexity complexity algorithm

18
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:26,320
complexity complexity algorithm
 

19
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:41,830
complexity complexity algorithm
complexity complex yeah

20
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:41,840

 

21
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,630

why do we need this because that it's a

22
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:44,640
why do we need this because that it's a
 

23
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,029
why do we need this because that it's a
way

24
00:00:45,029 --> 00:00:45,039
way
 

25
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,350
way
that we analyze how efficient an

26
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:47,360
that we analyze how efficient an
 

27
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,229
that we analyze how efficient an
equilibrium is

28
00:00:48,229 --> 00:00:48,239
equilibrium is
 

29
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,910
equilibrium is
okay so yeah okay so for example like

30
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:51,920
okay so yeah okay so for example like
 

31
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,150
okay so yeah okay so for example like
if i have a number at least a number

32
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:54,160
if i have a number at least a number
 

33
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:54,950
if i have a number at least a number
like three

34
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:54,960
like three
 

35
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,150
like three
two one five seven

36
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:58,160
two one five seven
 

37
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,029
two one five seven
so this is the computer uh this is the

38
00:01:01,029 --> 00:01:01,039
so this is the computer uh this is the
 

39
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,630
so this is the computer uh this is the
list of computer input

40
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:02,640
list of computer input
 

41
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,789
list of computer input
so if we want to know the maximum

42
00:01:06,789 --> 00:01:06,799
so if we want to know the maximum
 

43
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,429
so if we want to know the maximum
in the in the in this in this case

44
00:01:11,429 --> 00:01:11,439
in the in the in this in this case
 

45
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,510
in the in the in this in this case
how um what do you think how many times

46
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:13,520
how um what do you think how many times
 

47
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,870
how um what do you think how many times
the computer needs to

48
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:14,880
the computer needs to
 

49
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,149
the computer needs to
check like this is the numbers this is

50
00:01:18,149 --> 00:01:18,159
check like this is the numbers this is
 

51
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,070
check like this is the numbers this is
the list of numbers what are we doing

52
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:20,080
the list of numbers what are we doing
 

53
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,710
the list of numbers what are we doing
so finding the maximum maximum

54
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:24,720
so finding the maximum maximum
 

55
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,789
so finding the maximum maximum
yeah i know the human can just look it's

56
00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:26,799
yeah i know the human can just look it's
 

57
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,109
yeah i know the human can just look it's
seven right but the computer don't know

58
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:29,119
seven right but the computer don't know
 

59
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,830
seven right but the computer don't know
he has to check the first number okay it

60
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:31,840
he has to check the first number okay it
 

61
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,950
he has to check the first number okay it
has to keep a

62
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:32,960
has to keep a
 

63
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,270
has to keep a
maximum current maximum for example is

64
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:35,280
maximum current maximum for example is
 

65
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,230
maximum current maximum for example is
three

66
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:36,240
three
 

67
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,550
three
is two bigger than three no is one

68
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:38,560
is two bigger than three no is one
 

69
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,429
is two bigger than three no is one
bigger than three

70
00:01:39,429 --> 00:01:39,439
bigger than three
 

71
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,670
bigger than three
no is five bigger than three yes let me

72
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:41,680
no is five bigger than three yes let me
 

73
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,109
no is five bigger than three yes let me
upload this

74
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:43,119
upload this
 

75
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,270
upload this
yes yeah is seven second and three yes

76
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:47,280
yes yeah is seven second and three yes
 

77
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,830
yes yeah is seven second and three yes
together five yes okay and then now he

78
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:49,840
together five yes okay and then now he
 

79
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,630
together five yes okay and then now he
found that

80
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:50,640
found that
 

81
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,590
found that
so the computer needs to scan once right

82
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:53,600
so the computer needs to scan once right
 

83
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,910
so the computer needs to scan once right
if there are any items and elements in

84
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:55,920
if there are any items and elements in
 

85
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,550
if there are any items and elements in
the list

86
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:56,560
the list
 

87
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,389
the list
he needs to check n times right

88
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:00,399
he needs to check n times right
 

89
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,670
he needs to check n times right
yeah so in so

90
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:03,680
yeah so in so
 

91
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,310
yeah so in so
you know how to do this yeah define yeah

92
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:06,320
you know how to do this yeah define yeah
 

93
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,749
you know how to do this yeah define yeah
max

94
00:02:07,749 --> 00:02:07,759
max
 

95
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,510
max
n right yes yeah you can just do this uh

96
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:11,520
n right yes yeah you can just do this uh
 

97
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,110
n right yes yeah you can just do this uh
if this answer is a very small number

98
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:15,120
if this answer is a very small number
 

99
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,589
if this answer is a very small number
let's say uh let's say put in the first

100
00:02:17,589 --> 00:02:17,599
let's say uh let's say put in the first
 

101
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:18,710
let's say uh let's say put in the first
number at the beginning

102
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:18,720
number at the beginning
 

103
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,309
number at the beginning
and zero okay and then those four i

104
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:22,319
and zero okay and then those four i
 

105
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,070
and zero okay and then those four i
in answer uh in n

106
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:26,080
in answer uh in n
 

107
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,470
in answer uh in n
what do we know if i bigger than

108
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:30,480
what do we know if i bigger than
 

109
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,589
what do we know if i bigger than
answer right then answer equals i all

110
00:02:33,589 --> 00:02:33,599
answer right then answer equals i all
 

111
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,790
answer right then answer equals i all
right

112
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:34,800
right
 

113
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,910
right
you see chicken chicken is least

114
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:37,920
you see chicken chicken is least
 

115
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,509
you see chicken chicken is least
and if it's the number it's bigger than

116
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:39,519
and if it's the number it's bigger than
 

117
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,030
and if it's the number it's bigger than
the color maximum and i

118
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:41,040
the color maximum and i
 

119
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,350
the color maximum and i
update it right this is the method i

120
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:43,360
update it right this is the method i
 

121
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,110
update it right this is the method i
just told you right give me the maximum

122
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:45,120
just told you right give me the maximum
 

123
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,670
just told you right give me the maximum
so

124
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:45,680
so
 

125
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,990
so
if i update it and it kind of maximizes

126
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:48,000
if i update it and it kind of maximizes
 

127
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,830
if i update it and it kind of maximizes
right

128
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:49,840
right
 

129
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,229
right
updated is seven okay

130
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:54,239

 

131
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,270

okay so so look the computer needs the

132
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:57,280
okay so so look the computer needs the
 

133
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:57,910
okay so so look the computer needs the
in

134
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:57,920
in
 

135
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,949
in
needs to check and items so it turns

136
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:00,959
needs to check and items so it turns
 

137
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,830
needs to check and items so it turns
each time it needs to end right so this

138
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:03,840
each time it needs to end right so this
 

139
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,550
each time it needs to end right so this
leads to

140
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:04,560
leads to
 

141
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,070
leads to
our complexity we use the big o

142
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:08,080
our complexity we use the big o
 

143
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,190
our complexity we use the big o
which is n okay this is called linear

144
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:11,200
which is n okay this is called linear
 

145
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,470
which is n okay this is called linear
because the computer need

146
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:12,480
because the computer need
 

147
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,990
because the computer need
influence n if if that 100 items

148
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,000
influence n if if that 100 items
 

149
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,790
influence n if if that 100 items
yeah if n is 100 then computer needs to

150
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:18,800
yeah if n is 100 then computer needs to
 

151
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,750
yeah if n is 100 then computer needs to
check how many times

152
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:19,760
check how many times
 

153
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,869
check how many times
100 yes exactly how a thousand

154
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:22,879
100 yes exactly how a thousand
 

155
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,149
100 yes exactly how a thousand
a thousand yes you see the as this grows

156
00:03:26,149 --> 00:03:26,159
a thousand yes you see the as this grows
 

157
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,750
a thousand yes you see the as this grows
and then the computer needs to check

158
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:27,760
and then the computer needs to check
 

159
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,990
and then the computer needs to check
that the number yeah so

160
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:30,000
that the number yeah so
 

161
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,350
that the number yeah so
basically this is n this is t and then

162
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:33,360
basically this is n this is t and then
 

163
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,430
basically this is n this is t and then
basically it needs to check this is

164
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:35,440
basically it needs to check this is
 

165
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,430
basically it needs to check this is
called initial yeah this is 100 and then

166
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:37,440
called initial yeah this is 100 and then
 

167
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,630
called initial yeah this is 100 and then
what it

168
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:38,640
what it
 

169
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,990
what it
corresponds is 100 here got it this is

170

corresponds is 100 here got it this is
 

171
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,910
corresponds is 100 here got it this is
called linear yeah

172
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:43,920
called linear yeah
 

173
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,229
called linear yeah
okay so this is convenient okay so

174
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:48,239

 

175
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,149

yeah yeah you remember okay so i put it

and this is called linear yeah linear
 

183
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,429
and this is called linear yeah linear
so how about let's say if i remember

184
00:03:59,429 --> 00:03:59,439
so how about let's say if i remember
 

185
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,190
so how about let's say if i remember
yesterday we talk about mathematic

186
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:01,200
yesterday we talk about mathematic
 

187
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,229
yesterday we talk about mathematic
induction right

188
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:02,239
induction right
 

189
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,990
induction right
remember can you remind me for the sum

190
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:06,000
remember can you remind me for the sum
 

191
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,110
remember can you remind me for the sum
of the first and positive numbers

192
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:09,120
of the first and positive numbers
 

193
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,630
of the first and positive numbers
what do you mean remember

194
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:12,640
what do you mean remember
 

195
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,150
what do you mean remember
one two three four over n remember

196
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:16,160
one two three four over n remember
 

197
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,430
one two three four over n remember
yes this equals n times m

198
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:19,440
yes this equals n times m
 

199
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,629
yes this equals n times m
plus one divided by two right yes

200
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:22,639
plus one divided by two right yes
 

201
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,070
plus one divided by two right yes
yes yes

202
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:26,080
yes yes
 

203
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,270
yes yes
yes okay so tell me if there are

204
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:29,280
yes okay so tell me if there are
 

205
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,150
yes okay so tell me if there are
if n is a thousand how many terms does

206
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,160
if n is a thousand how many terms does
 

207
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,310
if n is a thousand how many terms does
the computer need

208
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:34,320
the computer need
 

209
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,550
the computer need
no because the computer can just work

210
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:36,560
no because the computer can just work
 

211
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,790
no because the computer can just work
out by this mathematic formula

212
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:38,800
out by this mathematic formula
 

213
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,830
out by this mathematic formula
right you can just plug in the a

214
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:41,840
right you can just plug in the a
 

215
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,270
right you can just plug in the a
thousand here

216
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:43,280
thousand here
 

217
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,710
thousand here
right and then you can get the

218
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:46,720
right and then you can get the
 

219
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,390
right and then you can get the
equations you can turn the number

220
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:48,400
equations you can turn the number
 

221
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,909
equations you can turn the number
immediately right what

222
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:49,919
immediately right what
 

223
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,510
immediately right what
even it's ten million it's one time yeah

224
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:53,520
even it's ten million it's one time yeah
 

225
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,469
even it's ten million it's one time yeah
or one time yeah if it's one million

226
00:04:56,469 --> 00:04:56,479
or one time yeah if it's one million
 

227
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:57,350
or one time yeah if it's one million
it's still

228
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:57,360
it's still
 

229
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,350
it's still
instant right computer can just work out

230
00:04:59,350 --> 00:04:59,360
instant right computer can just work out
 

231
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,070
instant right computer can just work out
the formula basically

232
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:02,080
the formula basically
 

233
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,710
the formula basically
so it means that the complexity does not

234
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:04,720
so it means that the complexity does not
 

235
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,909
so it means that the complexity does not
grow

236
00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:05,919
grow
 

237
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,150
grow
as the size of the input so what does it

238
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:08,160
as the size of the input so what does it
 

239
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,029
as the size of the input so what does it
mean is the

240
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:09,039
mean is the
 

241
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,310
mean is the
complexity is one o

242
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:12,320
complexity is one o
 

243
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,510
complexity is one o
one which is called constant

244
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:15,520
one which is called constant
 

245
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,790
one which is called constant
do you get it zero oh no

246
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:18,800
do you get it zero oh no
 

247
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,830
do you get it zero oh no
big big o oh oh like

248
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:22,840
big big o oh oh like
 

249
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,830
big big o oh oh like
oh

250
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:25,840
oh
 

251
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,990
oh
okay so this is another way okay

252
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:28,000
okay so this is another way okay
 

253
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,310
okay so this is another way okay

looking if this is
 

265
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,189
looking if this is
zero this is a

266
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:49,199
zero this is a
 

267
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,550
zero this is a
okay if this is zero is eight how many

268
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:52,560
okay if this is zero is eight how many
 

269
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,749
okay if this is zero is eight how many
times

270
00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:53,759
times
 

271
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,870
times
i need to for the computer needs to

272
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:56,880
i need to for the computer needs to
 

273
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,390
i need to for the computer needs to
check

274
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:58,400
check
 

275
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,309
check
if i want to look for the number like

276
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:00,319
if i want to look for the number like
 

277
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,230
if i want to look for the number like
seven how many times the

278
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:02,240
seven how many times the
 

279
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,309
seven how many times the
seven yeah the computer needs to find

280
00:06:04,309 --> 00:06:04,319
seven yeah the computer needs to find
 

281
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,150
seven yeah the computer needs to find
the number seven here and

282
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:06,160
the number seven here and
 

283
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,390
the number seven here and
in final research remember how do we do

284
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:08,400
in final research remember how do we do
 

285
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,350
in final research remember how do we do
it

286
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:09,360
it
 

287
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,950
it
how do we do this final research do you

288
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:10,960
how do we do this final research do you
 

289
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,550
how do we do this final research do you
still remember how do we do the final

290
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:12,560
still remember how do we do the final
 

291
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,550
still remember how do we do the final
research

292
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:14,560
research
 

293
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,830
research
we change now we check in the middle

294
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:17,840
we change now we check in the middle
 

295
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,360
we change now we check in the middle
right the meter is four right yes

296
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:21,370
right the meter is four right yes
 

297
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:25,350
right the meter is four right yes
[Music]

298

299
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,790

it doesn't matter you just pick a

300
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:26,800
it doesn't matter you just pick a
 

301
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,469
it doesn't matter you just pick a
dominant number it doesn't have to be

302
00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:28,479
dominant number it doesn't have to be
 

303
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,950
dominant number it doesn't have to be
exactly the meter you just have to be

304
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:30,960
exactly the meter you just have to be
 

305
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,350
exactly the meter you just have to be
around meter so it's seven bigger than

306
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:33,360
around meter so it's seven bigger than
 

307
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:33,990
around meter so it's seven bigger than
four

308
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:34,000
four
 

309
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,230
four
yes so it's it's definitely in this side

310
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:36,240
yes so it's it's definitely in this side
 

311
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,110
yes so it's it's definitely in this side
right

312
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:37,120
right
 

313
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,350
right
and then an a and four the middle

314
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:41,360
and then an a and four the middle
 

315
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,350
and then an a and four the middle
what four and eight six six okay so here

316
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:45,360
what four and eight six six okay so here
 

317
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,550
what four and eight six six okay so here
and is it six seven bigger than six yeah

318
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:48,560
and is it six seven bigger than six yeah
 

319
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,070
and is it six seven bigger than six yeah
okay so i don't need to consider this

320
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:50,080
okay so i don't need to consider this
 

321
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,629
okay so i don't need to consider this
yeah so the answer is here right

322
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:52,639
yeah so the answer is here right
 

323
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,990
yeah so the answer is here right
seven and six meter seven yeah we find

324
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,000
seven and six meter seven yeah we find
 

325
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,670
seven and six meter seven yeah we find
it you see so how many times

326
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:57,680
it you see so how many times
 

327
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,110
it you see so how many times
maximum it needs it needs two

328
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:01,120
maximum it needs it needs two
 

329
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,430
maximum it needs it needs two
three times right three three times so

330
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:03,440
three times right three three times so
 

331
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,270
three times right three three times so
what do we know is three times

332
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:05,280
what do we know is three times
 

333
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,950
what do we know is three times
is that two times two times two

334
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:08,960
is that two times two times two
 

335
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,029
is that two times two times two
bigger or equal than eight right there

336
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:11,039
bigger or equal than eight right there
 

337
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,790
bigger or equal than eight right there
only three twos right

338
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:12,800
only three twos right
 

339
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,150
only three twos right
yeah so this is called rock

340
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:16,160
yeah so this is called rock
 

341
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,070
yeah so this is called rock
so you probably don't i don't know the

342
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:18,080
so you probably don't i don't know the
 

343
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,990
so you probably don't i don't know the
function yeah that's equal

344
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,000
function yeah that's equal
 

345
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,070
function yeah that's equal
yeah so we can write this way look if if

346
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:24,080
yeah so we can write this way look if if
 

347
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,350
yeah so we can write this way look if if
2 times 2 times 2 equals

348
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:27,360
2 times 2 times 2 equals
 

349
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,110
2 times 2 times 2 equals
a right yeah 2 to the power of 3 equals

350
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:31,120
a right yeah 2 to the power of 3 equals
 

351
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,550
a right yeah 2 to the power of 3 equals
am right

352
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:32,560
am right
 

353
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,390
am right
yes yes so we can write it this way

354
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:36,400
yes yes so we can write it this way
 

355
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,870
yes yes so we can write it this way
3 look at this number look look it's

356
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:38,880
3 look at this number look look it's
 

357
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,430
3 look at this number look look it's
very

358
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:39,440
very
 

359
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,710
very
look this yes 3 equals log 2

360
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:44,720
look this yes 3 equals log 2
 

361
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,830
look this yes 3 equals log 2
8

362
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:47,840

 

363
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,629

this is log function so basically look

364
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:50,639
this is log function so basically look
 

365
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,909
this is log function so basically look
log

366
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:51,919
log
 

367
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,710
log
a b equals c what can we do that

368
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:56,720
a b equals c what can we do that
 

369
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,589
a b equals c what can we do that
a to the power of c equals b okay this

370
00:07:59,589 --> 00:07:59,599
a to the power of c equals b okay this
 

371
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:00,390
a to the power of c equals b okay this
is

372
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:00,400
is
 

373
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,309
is
you basically can transform to each

374
00:08:02,309 --> 00:08:02,319
you basically can transform to each
 

375
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,589
you basically can transform to each
other okay

376
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:03,599
other okay
 

377
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,390
other okay
do you understand so 2 to the power of 3

378
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:06,400
do you understand so 2 to the power of 3
 

379
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,589
do you understand so 2 to the power of 3
equals a so we can

380
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:07,599
equals a so we can
 

381
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,029
equals a so we can
write 3 equals log 2a okay so log

382
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:11,039
write 3 equals log 2a okay so log
 

383
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,390
write 3 equals log 2a okay so log
log 2 is a function it takes the n

384
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:14,400
log 2 is a function it takes the n
 

385
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,469
log 2 is a function it takes the n
x y equals log to x so we can transform

386
00:08:18,469 --> 00:08:18,479
x y equals log to x so we can transform
 

387
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:19,589
x y equals log to x so we can transform
2 to the power of x

388
00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:19,599
2 to the power of x
 

389
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,990
2 to the power of x
equals 1 okay so the complexity for this

390
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:24,000
equals 1 okay so the complexity for this
 

391
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,189
equals 1 okay so the complexity for this
is o log

392
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:27,199
is o log
 

393
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,710
is o log
n right we call it log

394
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:30,720
n right we call it log
 

395
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,469
n right we call it log

00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:57,760
uh three no so he's eight sixteen
 

419
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,910
uh three no so he's eight sixteen
four four yes because it's one more step

to k right we can write it this way log
2 128 equals a

432
00:09:25,829 --> 00:09:25,839
2 128 equals a
 

433
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,990
2 128 equals a
so basically it's 2 to the power of a

434
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:28,000
so basically it's 2 to the power of a

probably write this first
 

445
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,269
probably write this first
constant is the most efficient right and

00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,470
do the other way two one three one three
two right

504
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:58,480
two right
 

505
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,670
two right
so six right yeah whoa

506
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:01,680
so six right yeah whoa
 

507
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:07,590
so six right yeah whoa
you can just times it by about two uh

508
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:07,600

 

509
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:15,030

number by two yeah yeah yeah um

510
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,040
number by two yeah yeah yeah um
 

511
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,630
number by two yeah yeah yeah um
yeah so look so how many how many

512
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:18,640
yeah so look so how many how many
 

513
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,630
yeah so look so how many how many
if i how many how many solutions would

514
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:20,640
if i how many how many solutions would
 

515
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,509
if i how many how many solutions would
that be

516
00:11:23,509 --> 00:11:23,519

 

517
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,710

how many so if i uh if i pick

518
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:26,720
how many so if i uh if i pick
 

519
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,710
how many so if i uh if i pick
n here right so i can i need to

520
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:30,720
n here right so i can i need to
 

521
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,069
n here right so i can i need to
go to n minus one right n minus one

522
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:34,079
go to n minus one right n minus one
 

523
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,949
go to n minus one right n minus one
so basically the solution is left right

524
00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:36,959
so basically the solution is left right
 

525
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:37,509
so basically the solution is left right
yes

526
00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:37,519
yes
 

527
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,069
yes
divided we need to divide it three times

528
00:11:40,069 --> 00:11:40,079
divided we need to divide it three times
 

529
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:40,870
divided we need to divide it three times
two six

530
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:40,880
two six
 

531
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:47,269
two six
right

532
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:47,279

 

533
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,269

always they're smaller to the biggest

534
00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:49,279
always they're smaller to the biggest
 

535
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,629
always they're smaller to the biggest
one if you want to and

536
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:50,639
one if you want to and
 

537
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,710
one if you want to and
to one is the same then you probably

538
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:52,720
to one is the same then you probably
 

539
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,310
to one is the same then you probably
need to divide entire two

540
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:54,320
need to divide entire two
 

541
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,069
need to divide entire two
right so okay all right all right

542
00:11:58,069 --> 00:11:58,079
right so okay all right all right
 

543
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,150
right so okay all right all right
all right so we haven't talked about

544
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:00,160
all right so we haven't talked about
 

545
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,310
all right so we haven't talked about
another one is called the

546
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:02,320
another one is called the
 

547
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,190
another one is called the
boundary no no no these look linear

548
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:05,200
boundary no no no these look linear
 

549
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,150
boundary no no no these look linear
first yeah

550
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:06,160
first yeah
 

551
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,110
first yeah
uh i just put it here for a while this

552
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:09,120
uh i just put it here for a while this
 

553
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,150
uh i just put it here for a while this
is n square right

554
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:10,160
is n square right
 

555
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,990
is n square right
n square like uh this is called

556
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:12,000
n square like uh this is called
 

557
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,230
n square like uh this is called
quadratic

558
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:16,240

 

559
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,150

okay so how about if a list

560
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:20,160
okay so how about if a list
 

561
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,190
okay so how about if a list
yeah and items if i want to search only

562
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:23,200
yeah and items if i want to search only
 

563
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,310
yeah and items if i want to search only
half of it

564
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:24,320
half of it
 

565
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,190
half of it
so uh these eggs if i told you i want to

566
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:27,200
so uh these eggs if i told you i want to
 

567
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:27,590
so uh these eggs if i told you i want to
just

568
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:27,600
just
 

569
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,350
just
to do half of it what's the complexity

570
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:31,360
to do half of it what's the complexity
 

571
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:38,949
to do half of it what's the complexity
is the anemia then you search

572
00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:38,959

 

573
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,670

look there are n items but i want to i

574
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:41,680
look there are n items but i want to i
 

575
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,990
look there are n items but i want to i
only need to scan half of it

576
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:44,000
only need to scan half of it
 

577
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,990
only need to scan half of it
right previously it's linear yeah

578
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:46,000
right previously it's linear yeah
 

579
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,190
right previously it's linear yeah
because

580
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:47,200
because
 

581
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,310
because
this time the t is to end to that

582
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:50,320
this time the t is to end to that
 

583
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,350
this time the t is to end to that
oh well two right but still we we

584
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:53,360
oh well two right but still we we
 

585
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,790
oh well two right but still we we
if o n the the complexity is on y

586
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:56,800
if o n the the complexity is on y
 

587
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,509
if o n the the complexity is on y
because we drop the constant if it's

588
00:12:59,509 --> 00:12:59,519
because we drop the constant if it's
 

589
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,269
because we drop the constant if it's
constant we drop it

590
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:01,279
constant we drop it
 

591
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,910
constant we drop it
yeah because the constant don't change

592
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:03,920
yeah because the constant don't change
 

593
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,710
yeah because the constant don't change
am i right

594
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:04,720
am i right
 

595
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,470
am i right
yeah so for like equilibrium analysis

596
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:08,480
yeah so for like equilibrium analysis
 

597
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,430
yeah so for like equilibrium analysis
if that evaluates a constant if even is

598
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:11,440
if that evaluates a constant if even is
 

599
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,550
if that evaluates a constant if even is
two times

600
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:12,560
two times
 

601
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,910
two times
and a hundred times n yeah if it needs

602
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:15,920
and a hundred times n yeah if it needs
 

603
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,990
and a hundred times n yeah if it needs
to go through a hundred times

604
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:18,000
to go through a hundred times
 

605
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,470
to go through a hundred times
this approach is tier me is still

606
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:20,480
this approach is tier me is still
 

607
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,910
this approach is tier me is still
scouting as

608
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:21,920
scouting as
 

609
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,190
scouting as
linear right am right

610
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:25,200
linear right am right
 

611
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,550
linear right am right
okay so the quadratic is uh let's go

612
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:28,560
okay so the quadratic is uh let's go
 

613
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,990
okay so the quadratic is uh let's go
back to the consensus okay

614
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:30,000
back to the consensus okay
 

615
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,949
back to the consensus okay
we haven't talked about that closer good

616
00:13:32,949 --> 00:13:32,959
we haven't talked about that closer good
 

617
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:46,949
we haven't talked about that closer good
job

618
00:13:46,949 --> 00:13:46,959

 

619
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,509

don't touch it okay uh because look eric

620
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:49,519
don't touch it okay uh because look eric
 

621
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,310
don't touch it okay uh because look eric
three numbers

622
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:50,320
three numbers
 

623
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,750
three numbers
three four two if you want to sort it

624
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:55,760
three four two if you want to sort it
 

625
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,389
three four two if you want to sort it
two three four yes i know but computer

626
00:13:58,389 --> 00:13:58,399
two three four yes i know but computer
 

627
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,670
two three four yes i know but computer
look computer easily

628
00:13:59,670 --> 00:13:59,680
look computer easily
 

629
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,829
look computer easily
n is three yeah and three numbers how do

630
00:14:01,829 --> 00:14:01,839
n is three yeah and three numbers how do
 

631
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,750
n is three yeah and three numbers how do
we solve it computer here

632
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:03,760
we solve it computer here
 

633
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,189
we solve it computer here
and then another this is i this is j

634
00:14:07,189 --> 00:14:07,199
and then another this is i this is j
 

635
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,949
and then another this is i this is j
yeah the two okay compare right

636
00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:10,959
yeah the two okay compare right
 

637
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,189
yeah the two okay compare right
and then compare if two if if two is

638
00:14:13,189 --> 00:14:13,199
and then compare if two if if two is
 

639
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,470
and then compare if two if if two is
smaller than three

640
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:14,480
smaller than three
 

641
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,230
smaller than three
okay i stop it okay and then j is here

642
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:18,240
okay i stop it okay and then j is here
 

643
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,030
okay i stop it okay and then j is here
yeah

644
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:19,040
yeah
 

645
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,230
yeah
this is three smaller than four

646
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:22,240
this is three smaller than four
 

647
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,269
this is three smaller than four
right okay so basically

648
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:25,279
right okay so basically
 

649
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,470
right okay so basically
basically if the i needs to go through n

650
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:28,480
basically if the i needs to go through n
 

651
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,670
basically if the i needs to go through n
step right

652
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:29,680
step right
 

653
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,389
step right
and for every i the j needs to go

654
00:14:32,389 --> 00:14:32,399
and for every i the j needs to go
 

655
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:33,110
and for every i the j needs to go
through

656
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:33,120
through
 

657
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,389
through
n minus one and minus two step

658
00:14:36,389 --> 00:14:36,399
n minus one and minus two step
 

659
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,310
n minus one and minus two step
right and etc so the complexity

660
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:40,320
right and etc so the complexity
 

661
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,990
right and etc so the complexity
is is the checking is around

662
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:44,000
is is the checking is around
 

663
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,790
is is the checking is around
n times n minus 1 divided by 2 okay so

664
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:46,800
n times n minus 1 divided by 2 okay so
 

665
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,910
n times n minus 1 divided by 2 okay so
this is still

666
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:47,920
this is still
 

667
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,790
this is still
quadratic right look because this is a

668
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:50,800
quadratic right look because this is a
 

669
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,590
quadratic right look because this is a
constant

670
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:51,600
constant
 

671
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,230
constant
all right this is constant this is

672
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:54,240
all right this is constant this is
 

673
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,230
all right this is constant this is
constant so this

674
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:56,240
constant so this
 

675
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,750
constant so this
this timing is still

676
00:14:59,750 --> 00:14:59,760
this timing is still
 

677
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,790
this timing is still
approaching me to cons to project it

678
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:02,800
approaching me to cons to project it
 

679
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,990
approaching me to cons to project it
okay so we all know we all so

680
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:06,000
okay so we all know we all so
 

681
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,550
okay so we all know we all so
when the aggregate gets more complex we

682
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:08,560
when the aggregate gets more complex we
 

683
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,829
when the aggregate gets more complex we
also have these

684
00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:09,839
also have these
 

685
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,670
also have these
yeah we call it cubic right cubic

686
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:13,680
yeah we call it cubic right cubic
 

687
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,790
yeah we call it cubic right cubic
and we have we have something

688
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:16,800
and we have we have something
 

689
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,310
and we have we have something
in between here yeah we call it o n log

690
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:20,320
in between here yeah we call it o n log
 

691
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,150
in between here yeah we call it o n log
n in the future we come

692
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:24,160
n in the future we come
 

693
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,590
n in the future we come
all this will not see in the future we

694
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:27,600
all this will not see in the future we
 

695
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,310
all this will not see in the future we
come across

696
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:28,320
come across
 

697
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,310
come across
some quick thoughts okay maybe i talk

698
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:30,320
some quick thoughts okay maybe i talk
 

699
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,230
some quick thoughts okay maybe i talk
about a quick sorting agreement

700
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:32,240
about a quick sorting agreement
 

701
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,509
about a quick sorting agreement
tomorrow and so look

702
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:35,519
tomorrow and so look
 

703
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,230
tomorrow and so look
one constant is the most efficient yeah

704
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:38,240
one constant is the most efficient yeah
 

705
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,230
one constant is the most efficient yeah
if you can solve a problem using a one

706
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:40,240
if you can solve a problem using a one
 

707
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,069
if you can solve a problem using a one
we prefer the one right

708
00:15:42,069 --> 00:15:42,079
we prefer the one right
 

709
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,550
we prefer the one right
and then we and then this is the second

710
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:46,560
and then we and then this is the second
 

711
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,069
and then we and then this is the second
rotherland yeah and then

712
00:15:50,069 --> 00:15:50,079
rotherland yeah and then
 

713
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:54,150
rotherland yeah and then
positive anemia linear than this one

714
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:54,160
positive anemia linear than this one
 

715
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,430
positive anemia linear than this one
and quadratic and cubic and then we have

716
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:57,440
and quadratic and cubic and then we have
 

717
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,110
and quadratic and cubic and then we have
also the exponential 2 to the power of n

718
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:01,120
also the exponential 2 to the power of n
 

719
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,269
also the exponential 2 to the power of n
and we also have n bacteria remember

720
00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:05,279
and we also have n bacteria remember
 

721
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,470
and we also have n bacteria remember
bacteria yes

722
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:08,480
bacteria yes
 

723
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,990
bacteria yes
oh we also have l squared

724
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:12,000
oh we also have l squared
 

725
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,110
oh we also have l squared
square n what's this square root

726
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:15,120
square n what's this square root
 

727
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,269
square n what's this square root
square root remember we we want to check

00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:17,279
square root remember we we want to check
 

729
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,550
square root remember we we want to check
if our number

730
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:18,560
if our number
 

731
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,230
if our number
we want to check if a number is a prime

732
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:20,240
we want to check if a number is a prime
 

733
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,629
we want to check if a number is a prime
number or not right we only need to go

734
00:16:22,629 --> 00:16:22,639
number or not right we only need to go
 

735
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,150
number or not right we only need to go
through the square root of

736
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:24,160
through the square root of
 

737
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,110
through the square root of
integer to check if it's divided by that

738
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:27,120
integer to check if it's divided by that
 

739
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:27,590
integer to check if it's divided by that
right

740
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:27,600
right
 

741
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,470
right
divisible and uh

742
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:32,480

 

743
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,829

yeah so

yeah so
 

745
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,110
yeah so
can you give me an example of the

746
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:39,120
can you give me an example of the
 

747
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,590
can you give me an example of the
factorial remember so if if this one two

748
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:41,600
factorial remember so if if this one two
 

749
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,110

permutation

774
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:14,240
permutation
 

775
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,069
permutation
permutation yeah permutation of n items

776
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:18,079
permutation yeah permutation of n items
 

777
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,270
permutation yeah permutation of n items
is n factorial do you do not

778
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:21,280
is n factorial do you do not
 

779
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,429
is n factorial do you do not
understand why if there are n numbers

780
00:17:23,429 --> 00:17:23,439
understand why if there are n numbers
 

781
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,189
understand why if there are n numbers
how do we know is n factorial

782
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:25,199
how do we know is n factorial
 

783
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,029
how do we know is n factorial
how many away these three numbers three

784
00:17:27,029 --> 00:17:27,039
how many away these three numbers three
 

785
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,230
how many away these three numbers three
factorial equals six

786
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:28,240
factorial equals six
 

787
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,909
factorial equals six
so there are six solutions do you know

788
00:17:29,909 --> 00:17:29,919
so there are six solutions do you know
 

789
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,630
so there are six solutions do you know
why okay if i put n numbers

i just told you one two three how many

816
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:05,919
i just told you one two three how many
 

817
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,350
i just told you one two three how many
more months are gonna put

818
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:07,360
more months are gonna put
 

819
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,070
more months are gonna put
yes we yeah i can put one two three yeah

820
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:10,080
yes we yeah i can put one two three yeah
 

821
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,430
yes we yeah i can put one two three yeah
the first one yeah

822
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:11,440
the first one yeah
 

823
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,990
the first one yeah
if i pick one numbers how many numbers

824
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:14,000
if i pick one numbers how many numbers
 

825
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,750
if i pick one numbers how many numbers
can i put in the second place

826
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:17,760

 

827
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,830

yeah because i only put one right yeah

828
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:19,840
yeah because i only put one right yeah
 

829
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,750
yeah because i only put one right yeah
okay two and how many numbers i can put

830
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:21,760
okay two and how many numbers i can put
 

831
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,870
okay two and how many numbers i can put
for one

832
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:22,880
for one
 

833
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,590
for one
you see so if there are n numbers i can

834
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:25,600
you see so if there are n numbers i can
 

835
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,549
you see so if there are n numbers i can
do it this way

836
00:18:26,549 --> 00:18:26,559
do it this way
 

837
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,669
do it this way
n times n times n minus 1

838
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:29,679
n times n times n minus 1
 

839
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,909
n times n times n minus 1
times 3 look at the n minus 2 right

840
00:18:33,909 --> 00:18:33,919
times 3 look at the n minus 2 right
 

841
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,549
times 3 look at the n minus 2 right
and until 1 so this is exactly the n

842
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:36,559
and until 1 so this is exactly the n
 

843
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:37,990
and until 1 so this is exactly the n
factorial look at it

844
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:38,000
factorial look at it
 

845
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,390
factorial look at it
so if i tell you if the 4 numbers 1 2 3

846
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:40,400
so if i tell you if the 4 numbers 1 2 3
 

847
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,750
so if i tell you if the 4 numbers 1 2 3
4 how many permutations are there

848
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:43,760
4 how many permutations are there
 

849
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,789
4 how many permutations are there
uh

850
00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:46,799

 

851
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,909

24 yes exactly you get it so this is

852
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:49,919
24 yes exactly you get it so this is
 

853
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:50,470
24 yes exactly you get it so this is
called

854
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:50,480
called
 

855
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,310
called
bacteria right

856
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:54,320

 

857
00:18:54,320 --> 00:19:00,480

okay so

858
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:00,490

 

859
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:01,669

[Music]

860
00:19:01,669 --> 00:19:01,679
[Music]
 

861
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,390
[Music]
yeah and then you put whatever number

862
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:04,400
yeah and then you put whatever number
 

863
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:04,870
yeah and then you put whatever number
here

864
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:04,880
here
 

865
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,150
here
i choose one and then two

866
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:08,160
i choose one and then two
 

867
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,590
i choose one and then two
and then okay

868
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:11,600
and then okay
 

869
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,950
and then okay
okay so so let's do the sorting now

870
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:14,960
okay so so let's do the sorting now
 

871
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,029
okay so so let's do the sorting now
for for this fully sorting okay so

872
00:19:19,029 --> 00:19:19,039
for for this fully sorting okay so
 

873
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,750
for for this fully sorting okay so
look this is the first one yeah first

874
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:21,760
look this is the first one yeah first
 

875
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,190
look this is the first one yeah first
the fastest

876
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:23,200
the fastest
 

877
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,070
the fastest
thoughtful fact is to slow this constant

878
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:26,080
thoughtful fact is to slow this constant
 

879
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,590
thoughtful fact is to slow this constant
is the 40th

880
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:27,600
is the 40th
 

881
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,870
is the 40th
and then log n

882
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:30,880
and then log n
 

883
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:36,070
and then log n
second square root third

884
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:36,080

 

885
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,830

linear fourth factorial

886
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:39,840
linear fourth factorial
 

887
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,950
linear fourth factorial
and eight block and five i know what's

888
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:42,960
and eight block and five i know what's
 

889
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,669
and eight block and five i know what's
next

890
00:19:43,669 --> 00:19:43,679
next

seven right and
 

895
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,230
seven right and
these two which one is first i don't

896
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:52,240
these two which one is first i don't
 

897
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,549
these two which one is first i don't
know i have to check maybe this is

898
00:19:54,549 --> 00:19:54,559
know i have to check maybe this is
 

899
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,990
know i have to check maybe this is
next and this is yeah this is the slow

test
 

903
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,950
test
okay do you get it

904
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:02,960

 

905
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:10,090

what the is oh yeah contact

906

909
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,110
[Music]
we need to analyze the complexity okay

910
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:15,120
we need to analyze the complexity okay
 

911
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,070
we need to analyze the complexity okay
right

912
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:16,080
right
 

913
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,310
right
and another way this is called runtime

914
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:18,320
and another way this is called runtime
 

915
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,149
and another way this is called runtime
complexity and also we have

916
00:20:20,149 --> 00:20:20,159
complexity and also we have
 

917
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,549
complexity and also we have
another similar approach similar

918
00:20:22,549 --> 00:20:22,559
another similar approach similar
 

919
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,789
another similar approach similar
analysis called space complexity

920
00:20:24,789 --> 00:20:24,799
analysis called space complexity
 

921
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:28,070
analysis called space complexity
space is we can also use leads to

922
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:28,080
space is we can also use leads to
 

923
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,230
space is we can also use leads to
analyze the space it means how many

924
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:30,240
analyze the space it means how many
 

925
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,830
analyze the space it means how many
space do you need right

926
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:31,840
space do you need right
 

927
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,029
space do you need right
if you if you need another n i'd

928
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:35,039
if you if you need another n i'd
 

929
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,789
if you if you need another n i'd
m items if you if the size is n and you

930
00:20:38,789 --> 00:20:38,799
m items if you if the size is n and you
 

931
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:39,190
m items if you if the size is n and you
need

932
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:39,200
need
 

933
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,830
need
to allocate another n space for this

934
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:41,840
to allocate another n space for this
 

935
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,390
to allocate another n space for this
equilibrium

936
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:42,400
equilibrium
 

937
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,390
equilibrium
and the complexity is o n right the

938
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:44,400
and the complexity is o n right the
 

939
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,390
and the complexity is o n right the
first space okay

940
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:46,400
first space okay
 

941
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,669
first space okay
yes okay good job today
