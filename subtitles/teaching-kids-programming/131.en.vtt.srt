00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,030

oh hello hello mr

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:03,040
oh hello hello mr
 

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,990
oh hello hello mr
mr lauren how are you today good good

4
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:08,000

 

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,390

so okay so i've never drawn a tree okay

6
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:10,400
so okay so i've never drawn a tree okay
 

7
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,110
so okay so i've never drawn a tree okay
finally

8
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:11,120
finally
 

9
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,110
finally
yeah we know the price of the chip what

10
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:13,120
yeah we know the price of the chip what
 

11
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,629
yeah we know the price of the chip what
does binary mean

12
00:00:14,629 --> 00:00:14,639
does binary mean
 

13
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,670
does binary mean
k okay

14
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:17,680
k okay
 

15
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,470
k okay
it means that any notes in the binary

16
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:20,480
it means that any notes in the binary
 

17
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,189
it means that any notes in the binary
tree

18
00:00:21,189 --> 00:00:21,199
tree
 

19
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,790
tree
can have mmos how many kids two kids

20
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:24,800
can have mmos how many kids two kids
 

21
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,070
can have mmos how many kids two kids
and every note except that which no

22
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:28,080
and every note except that which no
 

23
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,189
and every note except that which no
has does not have parents wait okay how

24
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:31,199
has does not have parents wait okay how
 

25
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,510
has does not have parents wait okay how
many parents does one now have

26
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:33,520
many parents does one now have
 

27
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,310
many parents does one now have
except for good uh one yes okay and then

28
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:36,320
except for good uh one yes okay and then
 

29
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,709
except for good uh one yes okay and then
a final retreat is also a graph yeah

30
00:00:38,709 --> 00:00:38,719
a final retreat is also a graph yeah
 

31
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,750
a final retreat is also a graph yeah
a graph and it doesn't finally treat is

32
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:41,760
a graph and it doesn't finally treat is
 

33
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,869
a graph and it doesn't finally treat is
actually

34
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:42,879
actually
 

35
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,950
actually
how do you call it a cyclist a cyclic

36
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:46,960
how do you call it a cyclist a cyclic
 

37
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,270
how do you call it a cyclist a cyclic
a cyclic diuretic undirected one

38
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:51,280
a cyclic diuretic undirected one
 

39
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,670
a cyclic diuretic undirected one
undirected graph another negative yeah

40
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:55,680
undirected graph another negative yeah
 

41
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,110
undirected graph another negative yeah
okay ti

42
00:00:59,110 --> 00:00:59,120
okay ti
 

43
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,029
okay ti
a cycling means does not have cycle it

44
00:01:01,029 --> 00:01:01,039
a cycling means does not have cycle it
 

45
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,590
a cycling means does not have cycle it
does not have this kind of cycle okay

46
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:03,600
does not have this kind of cycle okay
 

47
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,950
does not have this kind of cycle okay
yeah and directly means the the age does

48
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:06,960
yeah and directly means the the age does
 

49
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,550
yeah and directly means the the age does
not have direction okay

50
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:08,560
not have direction okay
 

51
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,590
not have direction okay
so it does not have a direction yeah

52
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:13,600

 

53
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,190

a and directed graph

54
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:17,200
a and directed graph
 

55
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,149
a and directed graph
okay and direct graph and directly about

56
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:20,159
okay and direct graph and directly about
 

57
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,749
okay and direct graph and directly about
probably aug okay i don't know what's

58
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:21,759
probably aug okay i don't know what's
 

59
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,910
probably aug okay i don't know what's
the initials okay but anyway

60
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:23,920
the initials okay but anyway
 

61
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,350
the initials okay but anyway
so this is a binary tree so how about if

62
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:27,360
so this is a binary tree so how about if
 

63
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,510
so this is a binary tree so how about if
i tell you what what kind of binary is

64
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:29,520
i tell you what what kind of binary is
 

65
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,510
i tell you what what kind of binary is
this one

66
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:31,520
this one
 

67
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,950
this one
every no every level is the first note

68
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:34,960
every no every level is the first note
 

69
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,749
every no every level is the first note
first level has one note which is two to

70
00:01:37,749 --> 00:01:37,759
first level has one note which is two to
 

71
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,109
first level has one note which is two to
the power zero the

72
00:01:39,109 --> 00:01:39,119
the power zero the
 

73
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,149
the power zero the
second level has 2 no which is 2 to the

74
00:01:42,149 --> 00:01:42,159
second level has 2 no which is 2 to the
 

75
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,030
second level has 2 no which is 2 to the
power 1

76
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,040
power 1
 

77
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,109
power 1
the third level which is 2 to the power

78
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:45,119
the third level which is 2 to the power
 

79
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,310
the third level which is 2 to the power
2 yeah

80
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:46,320
2 yeah
 

81
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,630
2 yeah
yeah so that's how many when you add it

82
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:48,640
yeah so that's how many when you add it
 

83
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,789
yeah so that's how many when you add it
together 2 to the power of 0 plus 2 to

84
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:50,799
together 2 to the power of 0 plus 2 to
 

85
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,109
together 2 to the power of 0 plus 2 to
the power 1 plus 2 to the power 2

86
00:01:53,109 --> 00:01:53,119
the power 1 plus 2 to the power 2
 

87
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,310
the power 1 plus 2 to the power 2
equals one two to the power

88
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:56,320
equals one two to the power
 

89
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,590
equals one two to the power
of three minus one okay so basically if

90
00:01:59,590 --> 00:01:59,600
of three minus one okay so basically if
 

91
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,910
of three minus one okay so basically if
there are n

92
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:01,920
there are n
 

93
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,749
there are n
n levels how many nodes does these

94
00:02:05,749 --> 00:02:05,759
n levels how many nodes does these
 

95
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,949
n levels how many nodes does these
three we call it full binary yeah

96
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:08,959
three we call it full binary yeah
 

97
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,190
three we call it full binary yeah
because it's full yeah you can't even

98
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:11,200
because it's full yeah you can't even
 

99
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,390
because it's full yeah you can't even
for level three

100
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:12,400
for level three
 

101
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,110
for level three
you can't have any more notes right the

102
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:15,120
you can't have any more notes right the
 

103
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,229
you can't have any more notes right the
maximum

104
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:16,239
maximum
 

105
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,589
maximum
binary uh the maximum

00:02:19,589 --> 00:02:19,599
binary uh the maximum
 

107
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,229
binary uh the maximum
nodes of a binary tree which has three

108
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:22,239
nodes of a binary tree which has three
 

109
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,350
nodes of a binary tree which has three

00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:36,080
about how about four four
 

119
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,070
about how about four four
n equals four how many notes uh

133
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,949

yeah because it's 2 to the power of 6

134
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:14,959
yeah because it's 2 to the power of 6
 

135
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,470
yeah because it's 2 to the power of 6
minus 1 yeah so look

136
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:16,480
minus 1 yeah so look
 

137
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,550
minus 1 yeah so look
2 to the power of 0 plus 2 to the power

138
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:18,560
2 to the power of 0 plus 2 to the power
 

139
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,670
2 to the power of 0 plus 2 to the power
1 plus

140
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:19,680
1 plus
 

141
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,030
1 plus
here plus 2 to the power of

142
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,040
here plus 2 to the power of
 

143
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,470
here plus 2 to the power of
n equals equals 1

144
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:26,480
n equals equals 1
 

145
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,589
n equals equals 1
equals 2 to the power n plus 1 minus 1.

146
00:03:29,589 --> 00:03:29,599
equals 2 to the power n plus 1 minus 1.
 

147
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,190
equals 2 to the power n plus 1 minus 1.
okay yeah yeah look when n is 2

148
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:33,200
okay yeah yeah look when n is 2
 

149
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,789
okay yeah yeah look when n is 2
this added together equals 2 to the

150
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:34,799
this added together equals 2 to the
 

151
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,789
this added together equals 2 to the
power 3 minus 1 does it make sense yeah

152
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:36,799
power 3 minus 1 does it make sense yeah
 

153
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,789
power 3 minus 1 does it make sense yeah
this is called 4 minus 3. yeah

154
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:38,799
this is called 4 minus 3. yeah
 

155
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,630
this is called 4 minus 3. yeah
how about how about if not particular of

156
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:42,640
how about how about if not particular of
 

157
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,509
how about how about if not particular of
a value you can have a few nodes missing

158
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:45,519
a value you can have a few nodes missing
 

159
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,509
a value you can have a few nodes missing
particularly on the right okay so

160
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:47,519
particularly on the right okay so
 

161
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,830
particularly on the right okay so
if i erase that what what does this call

162
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:51,840
if i erase that what what does this call
 

163
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,309
if i erase that what what does this call
on and uh uh okay okay it complete final

164
00:03:56,309 --> 00:03:56,319
on and uh uh okay okay it complete final
 

165
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:56,869
on and uh uh okay okay it complete final
string

166
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:56,879
string
 

167
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,270
string
so it's complete but not four one is

168
00:03:59,270 --> 00:03:59,280
so it's complete but not four one is
 

169
00:03:59,280 --> 00:03:59,990
so it's complete but not four one is
four is every

170
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,000
four is every
 

171
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,869
four is every
node is four but you can erase some of

172
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:02,879
node is four but you can erase some of
 

173
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:03,429
node is four but you can erase some of
these

174
00:04:03,429 --> 00:04:03,439
these
 

175
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,509
these
look this is also a complete binary

176
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:07,519
look this is also a complete binary
 

177
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,750
look this is also a complete binary
but this is not right if

178
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:11,760
but this is not right if
 

179
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,470
but this is not right if
a node is missing it has to be on the

180
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:14,480
a node is missing it has to be on the
 

181
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,910
a node is missing it has to be on the
right hand side right

182
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:15,920
right hand side right
 

183
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,310
right hand side right
look this is not this is not a complete

184
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:18,320
look this is not this is not a complete
 

185
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,830
look this is not this is not a complete
binary okay

186
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:19,840
binary okay
 

187
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,189
binary okay
all right so okay the question is

188
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:23,199
all right so okay the question is
 

189
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,749
all right so okay the question is
how given the binary tree how do we

190
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:25,759
how given the binary tree how do we
 

191
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:26,230
how given the binary tree how do we
check

192
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:26,240
check
 

193
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,270
check
it's a complete financing okay so let me

194
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:29,280
it's a complete financing okay so let me
 

195
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,469
it's a complete financing okay so let me
do this okay

196
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:30,479
do this okay
 

197
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,110
do this okay
so look this is the finance this is the

198
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:33,120
so look this is the finance this is the
 

199
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,749
so look this is the finance this is the
complete biology also for binary and

200
00:04:35,749 --> 00:04:35,759
complete biology also for binary and
 

201
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,629
complete biology also for binary and
is at least a complete biology

202
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:40,639

 

203
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:46,150

yeah is this incomplete yeah

204
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:46,160
yeah is this incomplete yeah
 

205
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,909
yeah is this incomplete yeah
yes yes is this no

206
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:49,919
yes yes is this no
 

207
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,950
yes yes is this no
yeah yes is this no no

208
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:54,960
yeah yes is this no no
 

209
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,950
yeah yes is this no no
is this no yeah no because look there's

210
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:58,960
is this no yeah no because look there's
 

211
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,749
is this no yeah no because look there's
nothing here

212
00:04:59,749 --> 00:04:59,759
nothing here
 

213
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,870
nothing here
come on yeah yeah so if they're missing

214
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:02,880
come on yeah yeah so if they're missing
 

215
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,150
come on yeah yeah so if they're missing
no it has to be on the

216
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:04,160
no it has to be on the
 

217
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,909
no it has to be on the
on the right hand side right you'll get

218
00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:05,919
on the right hand side right you'll get
 

219
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,830
on the right hand side right you'll get
it yeah okay okay another one

220
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:08,840
it yeah okay okay another one
 

221
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,590
it yeah okay okay another one
uh oh wait okay

222
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:11,600
uh oh wait okay
 

223
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,430
uh oh wait okay
uh

224
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:15,440

 

225
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,629

is this no

226
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:18,639
is this no
 

227
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,990
is this no
no because every every level has to be

228
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:22,000
no because every every level has to be
 

229
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,310
no because every every level has to be
full

230
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:22,320
full
 

231
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,990
full
except the last one yeah yeah these

232
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:26,000
except the last one yeah yeah these
 

233
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,749
except the last one yeah yeah these
n minus n minus one it has to be

234
00:05:29,749 --> 00:05:29,759
n minus n minus one it has to be
 

235
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,070
n minus n minus one it has to be
all the notes have to be occupied except

236
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,080
all the notes have to be occupied except
 

237
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,110
all the notes have to be occupied except
the last one

238
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:33,120
the last one
 

239
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,629
the last one
and even the last one it has to be on

240
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:34,639
and even the last one it has to be on
 

241
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,950
and even the last one it has to be on
the left hand side as left as possible

242
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:36,960
the left hand side as left as possible
 

243
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,550
the left hand side as left as possible
okay yeah okay

244
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:38,560
okay yeah okay
 

245
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,790
okay yeah okay
so do you any idea how can we do this

246
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:42,800

 

247
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,350

what kind of the what is that well where

248
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:45,360
what kind of the what is that well where
 

249
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,070
what kind of the what is that well where
are the first ones

250
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:46,080
are the first ones
 

251
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,469
are the first ones
what's the price masters mean level

252
00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:48,479
what's the price masters mean level
 

253
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,390
what's the price masters mean level
level by level and how are we using this

254
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:50,400
level by level and how are we using this
 

255
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,830
level by level and how are we using this
breast

256
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:51,840
breast
 

257
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,390
breast
how are we using this breakfast search

258
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:54,400
how are we using this breakfast search
 

259
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,029
how are we using this breakfast search
uh

260
00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:55,039
uh
 

261
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,469
uh
it's key yeah yeah so

262
00:05:58,469 --> 00:05:58,479
it's key yeah yeah so
 

263
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,590
it's key yeah yeah so
yeah we're using a cube so in

264
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:01,600
yeah we're using a cube so in
 

265
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,590
yeah we're using a cube so in
in python what kind of data structure

266
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:03,600
in python what kind of data structure
 

267
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,070
in python what kind of data structure
are we using i mean what kind of eq

268
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,080
are we using i mean what kind of eq
 

269
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,309
are we using i mean what kind of eq
what does d2 double ended yes

270
00:06:10,309 --> 00:06:10,319
what does d2 double ended yes
 

271
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,909
what does d2 double ended yes
okay so yeah we're using the key of

272
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:11,919
okay so yeah we're using the key of
 

273
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,150
okay so yeah we're using the key of
binary search level by level so

274
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:14,160
binary search level by level so
 

275
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,909
binary search level by level so
what's that's a thought how how can we

276
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:15,919
what's that's a thought how how can we
 

277
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,189
what's that's a thought how how can we
check if it's a complete binary tree

278
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:19,199
check if it's a complete binary tree
 

279
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,830
check if it's a complete binary tree
oh we just look at the last one look at

280
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:21,840
oh we just look at the last one look at

but how how are we checking how are we
 

303
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,510

validating level one
 

305
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,629
validating level one
yeah how do we check the level by level

306
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:50,639
yeah how do we check the level by level
 

307
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,550
yeah how do we check the level by level
for example if this is not

308
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:52,560
for example if this is not
 

309
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,270
for example if this is not
this is not a complete binary tree so

310
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:55,280
this is not a complete binary tree so
 

311
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,950
this is not a complete binary tree so
you travel here right

312
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:56,960
you travel here right

six so how do you know it's not a
 

317
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,270

and the last one is not so that's
okay the second one is for which second

332
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:33,360
okay the second one is for which second
 

333
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,029
okay the second one is for which second
one

334
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:35,039
one
 

335
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,350
one
this one the second one is one

336
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:39,360
this one the second one is one
 

337
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,430
this one the second one is one
it's four yes okay yeah but the last one

338
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:41,440
it's four yes okay yeah but the last one
 

339
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,029
it's four yes okay yeah but the last one
look how do you know it

340
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:43,039
look how do you know it
 

341
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,790
look how do you know it
it's last level yeah yeah

342
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:46,800
it's last level yeah yeah
 

343
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:54,469
it's last level yeah yeah
okay then

344
00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:54,479

 

345
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,589

any idea any idea just any idea

346
00:07:57,589 --> 00:07:57,599
any idea any idea just any idea
 

347
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,350
any idea any idea just any idea
this is a bit tricky think about it

348
00:07:59,350 --> 00:07:59,360
this is a bit tricky think about it
 

349
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,749
this is a bit tricky think about it
preparing ryan i mean

350
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:01,759
preparing ryan i mean
 

351
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,350
preparing ryan i mean
think about it how are we dealing with

352
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:03,360
think about it how are we dealing with
 

353
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,189
think about it how are we dealing with
that yeah it's breakfast search but how

354
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:05,199
that yeah it's breakfast search but how
 

355
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,390
that yeah it's breakfast search but how
do we know

356
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:06,400
do we know
 

357
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,390
do we know
if a no i mean so basically we want to

358
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:10,400
if a no i mean so basically we want to
 

359
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:10,790
if a no i mean so basically we want to
look

360
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:10,800
look
 

361
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,029
look
for the empty hole there yeah right yeah

362
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:13,039
for the empty hole there yeah right yeah
 

363
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:13,909
for the empty hole there yeah right yeah
am i right

364
00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:13,919
am i right
 

365
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,270
am i right
if it is an empty hole yeah if

366
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:17,280
if it is an empty hole yeah if
 

367
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,189
if it is an empty hole yeah if
this should be empty this is empty yeah

368
00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:19,199
this should be empty this is empty yeah
 

369
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,430
this should be empty this is empty yeah
if it's an empty hole before

370
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:21,440
if it's an empty hole before
 

371
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,990
if it's an empty hole before
we reaching the last one then it's not a

372
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:24,000
we reaching the last one then it's not a
 

373
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,550
we reaching the last one then it's not a
complete

374
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:24,560
complete
 

375
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,189
complete
financing so look with level by level

376
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:27,199
financing so look with level by level
 

377
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:27,990
financing so look with level by level
but look

378
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:28,000
but look
 

379
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,029
but look
when we visit here it's not empty yeah

380
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:31,039
when we visit here it's not empty yeah
 

381
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:31,990
when we visit here it's not empty yeah
but it's

382
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:32,000
but it's
 

383
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,230
but it's
it's not supposed to be empty right all

384
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:34,240
it's not supposed to be empty right all
 

385
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,190
it's not supposed to be empty right all
right

386
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:35,200
right
 

387
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,990
right
look for a complete binary tree complete

388
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:38,000
look for a complete binary tree complete
 

389
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,509
look for a complete binary tree complete
binary

390
00:08:39,509 --> 00:08:39,519
binary
 

391
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,550
binary
you walk level by level yeah and it's

392
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:42,560
you walk level by level yeah and it's
 

393
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,670
you walk level by level yeah and it's
always very

394
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:43,680
always very
 

395
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,790
always very
not empty when you reach the end that's

396
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:46,800
not empty when you reach the end that's
 

397
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,430
not empty when you reach the end that's
fine

398
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:47,440
fine
 

399
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,990
fine
right all right but look if there's a

400
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:50,000
right all right but look if there's a
 

401
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,430
right all right but look if there's a
hole somewhere in between

402
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:51,440
hole somewhere in between
 

403
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,470
hole somewhere in between
between look look

404
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:54,480
between look look
 

405
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,350
between look look
one two three four and then look these

406
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:57,360
one two three four and then look these
 

407
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,389
one two three four and then look these
are holes

408
00:08:58,389 --> 00:08:58,399
are holes
 

409
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,190
are holes
holes yeah then it's not completely

410
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:01,200
holes yeah then it's not completely
 

411
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,790
holes yeah then it's not completely
binary

412
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:02,800
binary
 

413
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,550
binary
does it make sense yeah so we need to

414
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:06,560
does it make sense yeah so we need to
 

415
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,590
does it make sense yeah so we need to
have a

416
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:09,600
have a
 

417
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,509
have a
we need to have a pulling you know

418
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:11,519
we need to have a pulling you know
 

419
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,430
we need to have a pulling you know
what's pulling

420
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:13,440
what's pulling
 

421
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,350
what's pulling
pudding pulling what does this mean

422
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:17,360
pudding pulling what does this mean
 

423
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:25,700
pudding pulling what does this mean
yeah pull it

424
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:25,710

 

425
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:28,470

[Music]

426
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:28,480
[Music]
 

427
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,829
[Music]
yeah we have a hole we we set the hole

428
00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:31,839
yeah we have a hole we we set the hole
 

429
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:32,630
yeah we have a hole we we set the hole
to first

430
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:32,640
to first
 

431
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,790
to first
then we if we meet the empty hole we set

432
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:34,800
then we if we meet the empty hole we set
 

433
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,910
then we if we meet the empty hole we set
it to f two

434
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:35,920
it to f two
 

435
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,310
it to f two
right yeah and we when we mean the

436
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:38,320
right yeah and we when we mean the
 

437
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,590
right yeah and we when we mean the
middle

438
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:39,600
middle
 

439
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,710
middle
node if the whole has even as a whole

440
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:42,720
node if the whole has even as a whole
 

441
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,070
node if the whole has even as a whole
before then it's not a complete binary

442
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:46,080
before then it's not a complete binary
 

443
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,110
before then it's not a complete binary
am i right

444
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:47,120
am i right
 

445
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,230
am i right
does it make sense

446
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:52,240

 

447
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,150

so look if i i will perform this binary

448
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:56,160
so look if i i will perform this binary
 

449
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:56,710
so look if i i will perform this binary
search

450
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:56,720
search
 

451
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,509
search
uh by breakfast level by level but when

452
00:09:59,509 --> 00:09:59,519
uh by breakfast level by level but when
 

453
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,269
uh by breakfast level by level but when
i meet the whole

454
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:01,279
i meet the whole
 

455
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,430
i meet the whole
i notice okay i have already met the

456
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:03,440
i notice okay i have already met the
 

457
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,269
i notice okay i have already met the
hold yeah

458
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:05,279
hold yeah
 

459
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,110
hold yeah
and then the next time when i keep going

460
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:09,120
and then the next time when i keep going
 

461
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,710
and then the next time when i keep going
if i meet a note what does it mean

462
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:12,720
if i meet a note what does it mean
 

463
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,269
if i meet a note what does it mean
there's a hope before the end then it's

464
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:15,279
there's a hope before the end then it's
 

465
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,110
there's a hope before the end then it's
not a complete binary

466
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:17,120
not a complete binary
 

467
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,870
not a complete binary
right doesn't make sense yeah

468
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:20,880
right doesn't make sense yeah
 

469
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,750
right doesn't make sense yeah
okay so look look i i'll give you an

470
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:23,760
okay so look look i i'll give you an
 

471
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,069
okay so look look i i'll give you an
example okay

472
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:28,079

 

473
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,670

okay let's let's label it let's label it

474
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:31,680
okay let's let's label it let's label it
 

475
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,190
okay let's let's label it let's label it
one two three four five

476
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:35,200

479
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,230

q yeah q what's what's kill first thing

480
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:42,240
q yeah q what's what's kill first thing
 

481
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,150
q yeah q what's what's kill first thing
first out first thing first and what's

482
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:44,160
first out first thing first and what's
 

483
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,990
first out first thing first and what's
the first thing lasso

484
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:46,000
the first thing lasso
 

485
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,269
the first thing lasso
stack okay good look

486
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:49,279
stack okay good look
 

487
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,389
stack okay good look
that kill we initialize which we snow

488
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:52,399
that kill we initialize which we snow
 

489
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,430
that kill we initialize which we snow
root which is one one

490
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:55,440
root which is one one
 

491
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,269
root which is one one
okay so we repeat wire

492
00:10:59,269 --> 00:10:59,279
okay so we repeat wire
 

493
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,150
okay so we repeat wire
y and the q is not empty okay yeah all

494
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:02,160
y and the q is not empty okay yeah all
 

495
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,269
y and the q is not empty okay yeah all
right i mean look

496
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:03,279
right i mean look
 

497
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,790
right i mean look

what's next here the next element of the
queue

588
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:20,399
queue
 

589
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,430

593
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,670
i mean a meter not empty now but look
it's true

594
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:27,680
it's true
 

595
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,750
it's true
what does it mean it means that there's

596
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:29,760
what does it mean it means that there's
 

597
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,350
what does it mean it means that there's
a hope before six

a hope before six
 

599
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,550
a hope before six
and i return fourth right yeah it's not

600
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:34,560
and i return fourth right yeah it's not
 

601
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,870
and i return fourth right yeah it's not
complete financially all right

602
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:36,880
complete financially all right
 

603
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,750
complete financially all right
yeah so i will i can keep doing if if

604
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:39,760
yeah so i will i can keep doing if if
 

605
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,790
yeah so i will i can keep doing if if
there

606
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:40,800
there
 

607
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,509
there
if there are five here right this is

608
00:13:43,509 --> 00:13:43,519
if there are five here right this is
 

609
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:44,550
if there are five here right this is
still false right

610
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:44,560
still false right
 

611
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,470
still false right
because and then you put another five

612
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:46,480
because and then you put another five
 

613
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,470
because and then you put another five
right it doesn't matter so you have

614
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:48,480
right it doesn't matter so you have
 

615
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,790
right it doesn't matter so you have
plenty of leads empty by which which you

616
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:50,800
plenty of leads empty by which which you
 

617
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,310
plenty of leads empty by which which you
take it out but

618
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:52,320
take it out but
 

619
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,069
take it out but
but you don't expend any kids and

620
00:13:54,069 --> 00:13:54,079
but you don't expend any kids and
 

621
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:55,829
but you don't expend any kids and
eventually the queue will be empty

622
00:13:55,829 --> 00:13:55,839
eventually the queue will be empty
 

623
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,030
eventually the queue will be empty
and at last you return what

624
00:13:59,030 --> 00:13:59,040
and at last you return what
 

625
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,710
and at last you return what
it will turn on in in the happy pay

626
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:02,720
it will turn on in in the happy pay
 

627
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,389
it will turn on in in the happy pay
happy case true yes does it make sense

628
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:06,399
happy case true yes does it make sense
 

629
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,670
happy case true yes does it make sense
yeah okay so then the key thing here is

630
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:09,680
yeah okay so then the key thing here is
 

631
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,470
yeah okay so then the key thing here is
we expand we push the empty note in that

632
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:12,480
we expand we push the empty note in that
 

633
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,389
we expand we push the empty note in that
as a placeholder to

634
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:14,399
as a placeholder to
 

635
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,269
as a placeholder to
for next time if we meet the empty hole

636
00:14:17,269 --> 00:14:17,279
for next time if we meet the empty hole
 

637
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,350
for next time if we meet the empty hole
we send this out to

638
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:19,360
we send this out to
 

639
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,550
we send this out to
true right am right

640
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:22,560
true right am right
 

641
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,990
true right am right
yeah yeah i know when we meet the note

642
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:26,000
yeah yeah i know when we meet the note
 

643
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,550
yeah yeah i know when we meet the note
if we have no end there's a whole before

644
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:30,560
if we have no end there's a whole before
 

645
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,470
if we have no end there's a whole before
then we return force immediately right

646
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:34,480
then we return force immediately right
 

647
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,230
then we return force immediately right
does it make sense

648
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:38,240

 

649
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,829

should we do it defy

650
00:14:42,829 --> 00:14:42,839
should we do it defy
 

651
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:46,870
should we do it defy
complete final three okay finally three

652
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:46,880
complete final three okay finally three
 

653
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,189
complete final three okay finally three
is complete final three okay load

654
00:14:51,189 --> 00:14:51,199
is complete final three okay load
 

655
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,470
is complete final three okay load
and the column

656
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:54,480
and the column
 

657
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:00,870
and the column
yeah if if loot is empty what happened

658
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:00,880

 

659
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,189

if our empty tree we we call it

660
00:15:05,189 --> 00:15:05,199

 

661
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,590

we can we say it's a complete binary

662
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:07,600
we can we say it's a complete binary
 

663
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,030
we can we say it's a complete binary
yeah doesn't make sense

664
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:09,040
yeah doesn't make sense
 

665
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,550
yeah doesn't make sense
okay it's a very special case so if if

666
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:12,560
okay it's a very special case so if if
 

667
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,990
okay it's a very special case so if if
if it's a mt3 empty tree we we

668
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:18,000
if it's a mt3 empty tree we we
 

669
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,430
if it's a mt3 empty tree we we
uh we call it the complete binary yeah

670
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:21,440
uh we call it the complete binary yeah
 

671
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,949
uh we call it the complete binary yeah
yeah yeah okay okay so now

672
00:15:26,949 --> 00:15:26,959
yeah yeah okay okay so now
 

673
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,269
yeah yeah okay okay so now
what should we do next what should we do

674
00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:29,279
what should we do next what should we do
 

675
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,790
what should we do next what should we do
next

676
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:32,800

 

677
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,990

okay so q equals dq yeah

678
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:38,000

 

679
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,310

and at least of the beginning we put the

680
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:40,320
and at least of the beginning we put the
 

681
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,030
and at least of the beginning we put the
root in

682
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:41,040
root in
 

683
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,150
root in
right and we also have a hole which i

684
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:44,160
right and we also have a hole which i
 

685
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,030
right and we also have a hole which i
said to

686
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:45,040
said to
 

687
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,389
said to
two of us so false yeah whatever

688
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:48,399
two of us so false yeah whatever
 

689
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,350
two of us so false yeah whatever
so now i keep doing this twice yeah

690
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:51,360
so now i keep doing this twice yeah
 

691
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,230
so now i keep doing this twice yeah
quite q

692
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:52,240
quite q
 

693
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,670
quite q
yeah or y lens q bigger than zero it's

694
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:55,680
yeah or y lens q bigger than zero it's
 

695
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,389
yeah or y lens q bigger than zero it's
the same thing yeah

696
00:15:58,389 --> 00:15:58,399

 

697
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,230

i take a q our p current okay

698
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:02,240
i take a q our p current okay
 

699
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,269
i take a q our p current okay
current now p okay equals

700
00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:05,279
current now p okay equals
 

701
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:19,910
current now p okay equals
q dot one

702
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:19,920

 

703
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,189

so if if p

704
00:16:23,189 --> 00:16:23,199
so if if p
 

705
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,470
so if if p
is num if cannot know is like what

706
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:26,480
is num if cannot know is like what
 

707
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,749
is num if cannot know is like what
we do we should we do

708
00:16:29,749 --> 00:16:29,759
we do we should we do
 

709
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:34,829
we do we should we do
we set a hole to okay

710
00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:34,839
we set a hole to okay
 

711
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:40,230
we set a hole to okay
yes as well

712
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:40,240

 

713
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,790

as one that's what so as we need to push

714
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:44,800
as one that's what so as we need to push
 

715
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,670
as one that's what so as we need to push
the

716
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:45,680
the
 

717
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,069
the
kids um

718
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:50,079
kids um
 

719
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,710
kids um
so look if p is not noun it means we

720
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:52,720
so look if p is not noun it means we
 

721
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,470
so look if p is not noun it means we
currently know we have meter counter

722
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:54,480
currently know we have meter counter
 

723
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,670
currently know we have meter counter
but in this case if ho is hot if there

724
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:57,680
but in this case if ho is hot if there
 

725
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,389
but in this case if ho is hot if there
is a hole

726
00:16:58,389 --> 00:16:58,399
is a hole
 

727
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,829
is a hole
what should we return should we

728
00:17:02,829 --> 00:17:02,839
what should we return should we
 

729
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,829
what should we return should we
take

730
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:05,839
take
 

731
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,429
take
look remember if we we meet the whole

732
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:09,439
look remember if we we meet the whole
 

733
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,630
look remember if we we meet the whole
and and now this is the valid note

734
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:12,640
and and now this is the valid note
 

735
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,549
and and now this is the valid note
we about left there was previously i

736
00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:14,559
we about left there was previously i
 

737
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,150
we about left there was previously i
hope before i know we return first and

738
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:16,160
hope before i know we return first and
 

739
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,429
hope before i know we return first and
then now next we need to

740
00:17:17,429 --> 00:17:17,439
then now next we need to
 

741
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,710
then now next we need to
append what p dot append one

742
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:20,720
append what p dot append one
 

743
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:26,309
append what p dot append one
key no no no

749
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,990

in the binary tree yeah what's the space

750
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:48,000
in the binary tree yeah what's the space
 

751
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,110
in the binary tree yeah what's the space
complexity

752
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:49,120
complexity
 

753
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,669
complexity
oh n what's why are we using a cube

754
00:17:53,669 --> 00:17:53,679
oh n what's why are we using a cube
 

755
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,710
oh n what's why are we using a cube
additional additional space

756
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:56,720
additional additional space
 

757
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:02,170
additional additional space
to store the notes yeah

758
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:02,180

okay pop left left okay and what's next
ep is long what do we do if

780
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:43,520
ep is long what do we do if
 

781
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:48,230
ep is long what do we do if
p is now if p is not what you will do

782
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:48,240
p is now if p is not what you will do
 

783
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,549
p is now if p is not what you will do
we sell how to false

784
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:52,559
we sell how to false
 

785
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,590
we sell how to false
yeah yeah

786
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:55,600

 

787
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,310

come on i understand it come on why yeah

788
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:58,320
come on i understand it come on why yeah
 

789
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:58,870
come on i understand it come on why yeah
and

790
00:18:58,870 --> 00:18:58,880
and
 

791
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,710
and
equal false no and how this is different

792
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:02,720
equal false no and how this is different
 

793
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,750
equal false no and how this is different
than what i wrote

794
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:03,760
than what i wrote
 

795
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,310
than what i wrote
in the notes i'm just checking if you

796
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:06,320
in the notes i'm just checking if you
 

797
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:15,029
in the notes i'm just checking if you
understand okay not copying my notes

798
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:15,039

 

799
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,590

yeah yeah does that make sense yeah

800
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:17,600
yeah yeah does that make sense yeah
 

801
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,150
yeah yeah does that make sense yeah
right

802
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:18,160
right
 

803
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,390
right
yeah because at the beginning hole is

804
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:20,400
yeah because at the beginning hole is
 

805
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,230
yeah because at the beginning hole is
false we haven't met the whole

806
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:22,240
false we haven't met the whole
 

807
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,870
false we haven't met the whole
and now if p is now it means we have a

808
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:24,880
and now if p is now it means we have a
 

809
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,909
and now if p is now it means we have a
middle

810
00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:25,919
middle
 

811
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,230
middle
and if p is not empty if there is a hole

812
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:28,240
and if p is not empty if there is a hole
 

813
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,350
and if p is not empty if there is a hole
we return force yeah

814
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:29,360
we return force yeah
 

815
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,350
we return force yeah
otherwise we'll push the kids to the

816
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:31,360
otherwise we'll push the kids to the
 

817
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,390
otherwise we'll push the kids to the
back of kill

818
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:32,400
back of kill
 

819
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,230
back of kill
and every when the kill is not empty we

820
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:34,240
and every when the kill is not empty we
 

821
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,909
and every when the kill is not empty we
need to kill yeah we take an animal at

822
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:35,919
need to kill yeah we take an animal at
 

823
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,830
need to kill yeah we take an animal at
the beginning of the kill yeah for the

824
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:37,840
the beginning of the kill yeah for the
 

825
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,789
the beginning of the kill yeah for the
next time

826
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:38,799
next time
 

827
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,110
