so first of all we incur root and then

128
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:35,440
so first of all we incur root and then
 

129
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,150
so first of all we incur root and then
now

130
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:36,160
now
 

131
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,309
now
okay then let's go while loop why do i

132
00:02:38,309 --> 00:02:38,319
okay then let's go while loop why do i
 

133
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,509
okay then let's go while loop why do i
yeah why the q

134
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:39,519
yeah why the q
 

135
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,470
yeah why the q
is not empty yeah y q is not empty this

136
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:42,480
is not empty yeah y q is not empty this
 

137
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:42,949
is not empty yeah y q is not empty this
is the

138
00:02:42,949 --> 00:02:42,959
is the
 

139
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,470
is the
basic it's not empty

140
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:46,480

 

141
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,190

so what do we do we take we we dq we

142
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:49,200
so what do we do we take we we dq we
 

143
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,350
so what do we do we take we we dq we
take this one out yeah

144
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:51,360
take this one out yeah
 

145
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,750
take this one out yeah
yes we take this one now and

146
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:55,760
yes we take this one now and

of it so which is
two and three okay yeah so

152
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:05,680
two and three okay yeah so
 

153
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,869
two and three okay yeah so
because we push uh we take a for one

154
00:03:08,869 --> 00:03:08,879
because we push uh we take a for one
 

155
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,990
because we push uh we take a for one
hour and then we visit

156
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:12,000
hour and then we visit
 

157
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,869
hour and then we visit
now yeah when we visit the no we need to

158
00:03:14,869 --> 00:03:14,879
now yeah when we visit the no we need to
 

159
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:15,350
now yeah when we visit the no we need to
check

160
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:15,360
check
 

161
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,550
check
if if it's the first time of this level

162
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:18,560
if if it's the first time of this level
 

163
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,430
if if it's the first time of this level
so when we

164
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:19,440
so when we
 

165
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,190
so when we
eq it when we decrease we take basically

166
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:23,200
eq it when we decrease we take basically
 

167
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,190
eq it when we decrease we take basically
take all elements of the queue

168
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:25,200
take all elements of the queue
 

169
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,869
take all elements of the queue
because they belong to the same level

170
00:03:26,869 --> 00:03:26,879
because they belong to the same level
 

171
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,789
because they belong to the same level
which is level one okay and then i push

172
00:03:28,789 --> 00:03:28,799
which is level one okay and then i push
 

173
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:29,670
which is level one okay and then i push
two and three

174
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:29,680
two and three
 

175
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,229
two and three
and now next time how many elements are

176
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:32,239
and now next time how many elements are
 

177
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:32,789
and now next time how many elements are
in the queue

178
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:32,799
in the queue
 

179
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,309
in the queue
two right yeah yeah no

180
00:03:36,309 --> 00:03:36,319
two right yeah yeah no
 

181
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,270
two right yeah yeah no
two so these two elements belongs to the

182
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:39,280
two so these two elements belongs to the
 

183
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,789
two so these two elements belongs to the
same level yeah

184
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:40,799
same level yeah
 

185
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,550
same level yeah
i'm right yes so i take a two

186
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:44,560
i'm right yes so i take a two
 

187
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,630
i'm right yes so i take a two
i take the two and i put put a result

188
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:46,640
i take the two and i put put a result
 

189
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,309
i take the two and i put put a result
okay let's without one and

190
00:03:48,309 --> 00:03:48,319
okay let's without one and
 

191
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,750
okay let's without one and
these are two okay but and i push like

192
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:51,760
these are two okay but and i push like
 

193
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,789
these are two okay but and i push like
in kill of its kids nothing right it

194
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:54,799
in kill of its kids nothing right it
 

195
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,789
in kill of its kids nothing right it
doesn't have any kids okay

196
00:03:56,789 --> 00:03:56,799
doesn't have any kids okay
 

197
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,149
doesn't have any kids okay
yes yeah and i take the three

198
00:04:00,149 --> 00:04:00,159
yes yeah and i take the three
 

199
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,670
yes yeah and i take the three
what's which

200
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:03,680
what's which
 

201
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,030
what's which
uh what kids does it have four and five

202
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,040
uh what kids does it have four and five
 

203
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,229
uh what kids does it have four and five
so i take it out

204
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:08,239
so i take it out
 

205
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,869
so i take it out
and push four inside there okay okay

206
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:12,879
and push four inside there okay okay
 

207
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,390
and push four inside there okay okay
okay then again now we look at this four

208
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:16,400
okay then again now we look at this four
 

209
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,270
okay then again now we look at this four
and five

210
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:17,280
and five
 

211
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,550
and five
belongs to some level you see yeah and i

212
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:20,560
belongs to some level you see yeah and i
 

213
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,469
belongs to some level you see yeah and i
i need to in this loop i need to

214
00:04:24,469 --> 00:04:24,479
i need to in this loop i need to
 

215
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,230
i need to in this loop i need to
expand these two kids but it doesn't

216
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:26,240
expand these two kids but it doesn't
 

217
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,310
expand these two kids but it doesn't
have any look by the fall

218
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:28,320
have any look by the fall
 

219
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,430
have any look by the fall
the first time so i put it put it in the

220
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:31,440
the first time so i put it put it in the
 

221
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:31,830
the first time so i put it put it in the
ball

222
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:31,840
ball
 

223
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,990
ball
okay and that's it and take it for four

224
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:34,000
okay and that's it and take it for four
 

225
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,350
okay and that's it and take it for four
i'll take the fire out let's see

226
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:35,360
i'll take the fire out let's see
 

227
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:43,110
i'll take the fire out let's see
so there's one four one two four okay

228
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:43,120
so there's one four one two four okay
 

229
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:49,510
so there's one four one two four okay
what's the time complexity

230
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:49,520

 

231
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,469

leaflet and elements in the financing

232
00:04:52,469 --> 00:04:52,479
leaflet and elements in the financing
 

233
00:04:52,479 --> 00:05:09,350
leaflet and elements in the financing
what's the space complexity

234
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:09,360

 

235
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,629

uh we call it left left left view

236
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:14,639
uh we call it left left left view
 

237
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,150
uh we call it left left left view
and then loop and what's missing here

238
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:18,160
and then loop and what's missing here
 

239
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,390
and then loop and what's missing here
okay so look if first of all we need to

240
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:20,400
okay so look if first of all we need to
 

241
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,790
okay so look if first of all we need to
check if the root is empty or all right

242
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:22,800
check if the root is empty or all right
 

243
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,150
check if the root is empty or all right
if loot is numb we can walk

244
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:28,160
if loot is numb we can walk
 

245
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,909
if loot is numb we can walk
we can what if loot is now

246
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:31,919
we can what if loot is now
 

247
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,110
we can what if loot is now
what we're going to return return

248
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:35,120
what we're going to return return
 

249
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,670
what we're going to return return
a list of empty things yeah at least

250
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:37,680
a list of empty things yeah at least
 

251
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,749
a list of empty things yeah at least
empty this it means that a list

252
00:05:39,749 --> 00:05:39,759
empty this it means that a list
 

253
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,790
empty this it means that a list
but has no elements in it okay

254
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:42,800
but has no elements in it okay
 

255
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,150
but has no elements in it okay
now remember we talked about

256
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:46,160
now remember we talked about
 

257
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,390
now remember we talked about
dq d-e-q-u-e what was that

258
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:50,400
dq d-e-q-u-e what was that
 

259
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:57,029
dq d-e-q-u-e what was that
q equals t e q u e what's this

260
00:05:57,029 --> 00:05:57,039

 

261
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,469

p e q u e what's that

262
00:06:00,469 --> 00:06:00,479
p e q u e what's that
 

263
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,309
p e q u e what's that
uh double k double ndq yeah

264
00:06:04,309 --> 00:06:04,319
uh double k double ndq yeah
 

265
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,189
uh double k double ndq yeah
we can push and pop from the both sides

266
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:07,199
we can push and pop from the both sides
 

267
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,270
we can push and pop from the both sides
and now we need to push

268
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:09,280
and now we need to push
 

269
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,110
and now we need to push
we need to first of all initialize the

270
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:11,120
we need to first of all initialize the
 

271
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,270
we need to first of all initialize the
double ndq with only one anime in it

272
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:13,280
double ndq with only one anime in it
 

273
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,590
double ndq with only one anime in it
which is what

274
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:15,600
which is what
 

275
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,150
which is what
the first boot okay so but it takes the

276
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:18,160
the first boot okay so but it takes the
 

277
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,909
the first boot okay so but it takes the
parameter of this so put up

278
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:19,919
parameter of this so put up
 

279
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,110
parameter of this so put up
put a load in the list yeah basically

280
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:23,120
put a load in the list yeah basically
 

281
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,629
put a load in the list yeah basically
this parameter means that

282
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:24,639
this parameter means that
 

283
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,749
this parameter means that
this could should be enumerated

284
00:06:27,749 --> 00:06:27,759
this could should be enumerated
 

285
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,790
this could should be enumerated
to be iterable so the loop is the should

286
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:30,800
to be iterable so the loop is the should
 

287
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,270
to be iterable so the loop is the should
be put

288
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:31,280
be put
 

289
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,950
be put
inside a list now how do we check if the

290
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:34,960
inside a list now how do we check if the
 

291
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,350
inside a list now how do we check if the
queue

292
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:35,360
queue
 

293
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,029
queue
has no has uh has any one at least one

294
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:39,039
has no has uh has any one at least one
 

295
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,430
has no has uh has any one at least one
element in it

296
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:41,440
element in it
 

297
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,790
element in it
wire why what

298
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:44,800
wire why what
 

299
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,990
wire why what
the lens how do we check the lens

300
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,000
the lens how do we check the lens
 

301
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,550
the lens how do we check the lens
lens yeah this is basically the same

302
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:50,560
lens yeah this is basically the same
 

303
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,510
lens yeah this is basically the same
segment

304
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:51,520
segment
 

305
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,870
segment
bigger than what

306
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:54,880
bigger than what
 

307
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,909
bigger than what
zero yeah okay

308
00:06:57,909 --> 00:06:57,919
zero yeah okay
 

309
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,629
zero yeah okay
so now uh okay i forgot this i need to

310
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:00,639
so now uh okay i forgot this i need to
 

311
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,629
so now uh okay i forgot this i need to
put this answer here in the list

312
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:02,639
put this answer here in the list
 

313
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,270
put this answer here in the list
yeah and this is a list there okay so

314
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:05,280
yeah and this is a list there okay so
 

315
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,430
yeah and this is a list there okay so
now

316
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:07,440
now
 

317
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,629
now
now what now what i i say this

318
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:10,639
now what now what i i say this
 

319
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,629
now what now what i i say this
size yeah current element now the

320
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:12,639
size yeah current element now the
 

321
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,749
size yeah current element now the
current elements

322
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:13,759
current elements
 

323
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,870
current elements
s z equals length key here so this

324
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:16,880
s z equals length key here so this
 

325
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,469
s z equals length key here so this
basically this is the lens

326
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:18,479
basically this is the lens
 

327
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,749
basically this is the lens
so it means that they are s z

328
00:07:21,749 --> 00:07:21,759
so it means that they are s z
 

329
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,629
so it means that they are s z
notes in the q right and they belong to

330
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:24,639
notes in the q right and they belong to
 

331
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,309
notes in the q right and they belong to
the same level do you get it

332

which is q dot
q zero only bracket zero okay you can

350
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:50,400
q zero only bracket zero okay you can
 

351
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,710
q zero only bracket zero okay you can
use this index yeah so means the first

use this index yeah so means the first
 

353
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,790
use this index yeah so means the first
element okay so which is the left side

354
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:54,800
element okay so which is the left side
 

355
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,270

so look length skill now is one right

364
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:05,840
so look length skill now is one right
 

365
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,390
so look length skill now is one right
look

366
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:06,400
look
 

367
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,749
look
yeah and sz is one right

368
00:08:09,749 --> 00:08:09,759
yeah and sz is one right
 

369
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,510
yeah and sz is one right
all right and answer put q0 which is one

370
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:13,520
all right and answer put q0 which is one
 

371
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,510
all right and answer put q0 which is one
right yes now i need to go through

372
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:17,520
right yes now i need to go through
 

373
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,550
right yes now i need to go through
this for i in

374
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:20,560
this for i in
 

375
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,990
this for i in
range actually

376
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:24,000
range actually
 

377
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,430
range actually
because we're not using the io we can

378
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:25,440
because we're not using the io we can
 

379
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,070
because we're not using the io we can
use underscore means that we don't care

380
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,080
use underscore means that we don't care
 

381
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,990
use underscore means that we don't care
yeah for we just want to iterate

382
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:32,000
yeah for we just want to iterate
 

383
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,110
yeah for we just want to iterate
as z times because they are s z

384
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:35,120
as z times because they are s z
 

385
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,230
as z times because they are s z
s z number of elements

386
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:38,240
s z number of elements
 

387
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,589
s z number of elements
in the in the queue and then we need to

388
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:41,599
in the in the queue and then we need to
 

389
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,509
in the in the queue and then we need to
pop it right pop it so look current

390
00:08:45,509 --> 00:08:45,519
pop it right pop it so look current
 

391
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,550
pop it right pop it so look current
equals q

392
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:48,560
equals q
 

393
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,750

00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:55,200
left right pop left
 

397
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,630
left right pop left
and then we need to push it on top

398
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:58,640
and then we need to push it on top
 

399
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:04,389
and then we need to push it on top
easier if current got left

400
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:04,399

 

401
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:11,509

we push it to the qx a pen

402

element from the key you take it from
 

499
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,990
element from the key you take it from
the beginning of the game

500
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:16,000
the beginning of the game
 

501
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,350
the beginning of the game
first thing what

502
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:19,360
first thing what
 

503
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,310
first thing what
first out yeah first thing like a queue

504
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:22,320
first out yeah first thing like a queue
 

505
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:22,630
first out yeah first thing like a queue
yeah

506
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:22,640
yeah
 

507
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,990
yeah
like like you right like you you are

508
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:26,000
like like you right like you you are
 

509
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,710
like like you right like you you are
look

510
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:26,720
look
 

511
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,310
look
this is uh this is the shop okay

512
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:30,320
this is uh this is the shop okay
 

513
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,590
this is uh this is the shop okay
this is a shop okay and then when the

514
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:33,600
this is a shop okay and then when the
 

515
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,389
this is a shop okay and then when the
people come

516
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:34,399
people come
 

517
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,030
people come
they join at the end of the queue yeah

518
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:37,040
they join at the end of the queue yeah
 

519
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,670
they join at the end of the queue yeah
but when these people get served

520
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:39,680
but when these people get served
 

521
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,509
but when these people get served
it serves from the beginning of q that

522
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:41,519
it serves from the beginning of q that
 

523
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,030
it serves from the beginning of q that
doesn't make sense yes

524
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,040
doesn't make sense yes
 

525
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,350
doesn't make sense yes
so first thing first off okay so this is

526
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:45,360
so first thing first off okay so this is
 

527
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,509
so first thing first off okay so this is
basically the data structure of that

528
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:47,519
basically the data structure of that
 

529
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,949
basically the data structure of that
so if i want to

530
00:11:50,949 --> 00:11:50,959
so if i want to
 

531
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,069
so if i want to
to change it to right y view

532
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:54,079
to change it to right y view
 

533
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,670
to change it to right y view
so what should we do there's only one

534
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:57,680
so what should we do there's only one
 

535
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,949
so what should we do there's only one
thing you need to change look

536
00:11:58,949 --> 00:11:58,959
thing you need to change look
 

537
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,829
thing you need to change look
if i want to change this agreement to

538
00:12:01,829 --> 00:12:01,839
if i want to change this agreement to
 

539
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,750
if i want to change this agreement to
standing from the right hand side

540
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:03,760
standing from the right hand side
 

541
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,470
standing from the right hand side
and looking this way so you return 1 2 5

542
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:06,480
and looking this way so you return 1 2 5
 

543
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,150
and looking this way so you return 1 2 5
instead of 1 2 4.

544
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:08,160
instead of 1 2 4.
 

545
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,230
instead of 1 2 4.
so which one which one

546
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:12,240
so which one which one
 

547
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,910
so which one which one
you need to change make a guess

548
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:17,920

 

549
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,590

so how do you deal with this problem now

550
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:19,600
so how do you deal with this problem now
 

551
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,030
so how do you deal with this problem now
this this code this bit of code

552
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:23,040
this this code this bit of code
 

553
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,990
this this code this bit of code
a calculator of the left side area one

554
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:26,000
a calculator of the left side area one
 

555
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,190
a calculator of the left side area one
three one two four

556
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:27,200
three one two four
 

557
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,389
three one two four
now with a little bit change then

558
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:30,399
now with a little bit change then
 

559
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,509
now with a little bit change then
i will return right right view so

560
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:33,519
i will return right right view so
 

561
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,350
i will return right right view so
from the right hand side so looking this

562
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:35,360
from the right hand side so looking this
 

563
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,430
from the right hand side so looking this
way will be one three four

564
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:37,440
way will be one three four
 

565
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,389
way will be one three four
okay so which one which one deal with

566
00:12:40,389 --> 00:12:40,399
okay so which one which one deal with
 

567
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,470
okay so which one which one deal with
appending the result into the answer

568
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:44,480

 

569
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,710

and instead of so any idea how to

570
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:48,720
and instead of so any idea how to
 

571
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:56,870
and instead of so any idea how to
yeah yeah well

572
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:56,880

 

573
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,829

which one deal with the answers so

574
00:12:59,829 --> 00:12:59,839
which one deal with the answers so
 

575
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,590
which one deal with the answers so
instead of pushing two i want to push

576
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:01,600
instead of pushing two i want to push
 

577

answer the answer is looking at you
 

585
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,230
answer the answer is looking at you
wait we can answer which bit is dealing

586
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:14,240
wait we can answer which bit is dealing
 

587
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:14,550
wait we can answer which bit is dealing
with

588
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:14,560
with
 

589
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,990
with
appending the element into the answer

590
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:18,000
appending the element into the answer
 

591
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,470
appending the element into the answer
yes what are we looking for so instead

592
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:20,480
yes what are we looking for so instead
 

593
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,150
yes what are we looking for so instead
of pushing the first element i want to

594
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:22,160
of pushing the first element i want to
 

595
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,350
of pushing the first element i want to
push what

596
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:23,360
push what
 

597
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,310
push what
the second no no no no the last number

598
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:26,320
the second no no no no the last number
 

599
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,750
the second no no no no the last number
yeah because if there are

600
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:27,760
yeah because if there are
 

601
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,590
yeah because if there are
more elements there i want to push it a

602
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:29,600
more elements there i want to push it a
 

603
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,949
more elements there i want to push it a
lot yes yeah so

lot yes yeah so
 

605
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,310
lot yes yeah so
which q 0 is the first one and q what is

606
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:34,320
which q 0 is the first one and q what is
 

607
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,710
which q 0 is the first one and q what is
the last one

608
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:36,720
the last one
 

609
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,470
the last one
q q 1 minus what

610
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:40,480
q q 1 minus what
 

611
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,710
q q 1 minus what
one we're done yeah that's that's the

612
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:42,720
one we're done yeah that's that's the
 

613
