1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
hello mr and mr wright are you right

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:07,839
yeah okay baby

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:10,000
okay so we're given an array of numbers

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,599
like 2 4 3

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,400
1 2

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,679
okay

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,199
and we're going to solve these numbers

8
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,279
using two

9
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:22,640
approach so we're going to solve the

10
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:24,480
numbers that start at the even index so

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,480
in even indexing

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,760
so let's certain these number we're

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,760
going to sort every two numbers starting

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,880
from first one

15
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,520
increasing

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:39,120
so a little bit one four and

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,200
the numbers start at the odd index okay

18
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:45,520
so the second number is actually the

19
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,680
index one so this is all indexes one two

20
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,039
three okay so that's zero one two three

21
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,879
okay

22
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,120
so

23
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,280
we're going to sort the numbers let's

24
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,840
start at the

25
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,480
even index

26
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,520
increasing and the odd index decreasing

27
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,439
so eventually the arrays will become

28
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,400
four

29
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:07,200
two

30
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,920
one

31
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,920
three okay

32
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,799
doesn't make sense yeah

33
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,560
okay i'm going to give another example

34
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:20,720
okay so you need to tell me what's the

35
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,720
array going to be like after sorting

36
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,479
all right

37
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,439
one

38
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,600
two

39
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,920
zero

40
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:36,119
five okay this is just this one so

41
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,119
what's this going to be like

42
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:43,209
[Music]

43
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,119
okay so we're down look these these two

44
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,960
numbers increasing so zero one these two

45
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,560
numbers decreasing

46
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,719
five too okay

47
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,360
so

48
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:02,079
yeah make sense yeah yeah so ho ho we're

49
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,079
going to do this

50
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:08,720
yeah anyway what's the only way you like

51
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,759
anyway well the first thing to do is to

52
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,440
do

53
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,959
it to play games

54
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,920
is to uh

55
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,160
um

56
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,959
check the

57
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,640
index check index

58
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,400
okay that could be one way how can we

59
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,080
check the index but we're going to

60
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,400
eventually we're going to

61
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,680
we yeah so the first thing to do is to

62
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,800
find the

63
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,760
just to split the array into twos right

64
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,599
once containing the numbers starting the

65
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,200
inver index the other one starting from

66
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,840
the odd index right

67
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,160
yeah and now we can sort those

68
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,920
arrays two arrays separately and then we

69
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,000
can merge them right that's the one

70
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,879
approach all right

71
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,879
okay now let's do this

72
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,560
okay

73
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,200
okay so let let's say if the if these

74
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,840
numbers is empty okay if this if the

75
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,840
numbers is

76
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,200
and we just return okay

77
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,280
now the odd index

78
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,159
or index equals how can we pick the

79
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,480
numbers only for the odd index do you

80
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:32,560
still remember how do we pick the

81
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,560
numbers let's start with the even index

82
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,400
plus

83
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,040
yeah you remember two yeah every two

84
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,200
means every other element okay so the

85
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:45,200
number remember this thing

86
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:49,040
remember listing a column b currency

87
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,799
start at a index a and the index b

88
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,080
but not including it

89
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,840
every

90
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,879
c step okay

91
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,200
so all index we start our index star

92
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,640
with the second one right so one until

93
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,840
the end

94
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,799
and every other element right even index

95
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,799
start with zero

96
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,280
ah they still remember start with zero

97
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,239
and the end every and

98
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,159
every

99
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,000
other element that's why we'll put a

100
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,239
step to here

101
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,239
right

102
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,800
do we note if they have the same number

103
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,080
of elements

104
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,800
um

105
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,440
no no yeah that's that's uh that's for

106
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,919
sure because the number could contain

107
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,880
odd numbers or all numbers and numbers

108
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,680
or even numbers of numbers right yeah

109
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,880
yeah

110
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,800
so

111
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,840
so okay so look

112
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,720
let's say

113
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,199
one two three four okay

114
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,360
so after this the odd

115
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,440
will contain

116
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,479
okay maybe we i put another five here

117
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,360
okay odd number will contain

118
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,400
two

119
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,040
four

120
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,320
right the even number

121
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,120
will contain

122
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,840
one three five okay

123
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,080
yeah let me start we start with the even

124
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,320
number right so yeah so what what do we

125
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,310
do now so we have even numbers and all

126
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,720
numbers so what do we do now we know

127
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:14,400
[Music]

128
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,800
them yeah we saw that we need to solve

129
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,960
these numbers increasing so first we

130
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,960
need to solve this number increasing so

131
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,800
the numbers

132
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,280
so so let's say we want to solve the

133
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,120
even numbers increasing and then the odd

134
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,199
number decreasing yeah so let's say we

135
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,320
put a sort here

136
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,680
sorted

137
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,560
yeah

138
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,720
even number increasing the odd number

139
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,840
decreasing started

140
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,880
we give a key we say reverse equals true

141
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,360
right

142
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,360
which means that we want to sort it in

143
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,720
reverse order which is from the largest

144
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,720
to the smallest

145
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,800
right alternatively we can solve this

146
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,639
number and we can reverse it do we still

147
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,960
remember how we reverse and a list

148
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,199
minus one yeah or whether i or if we can

149
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,560
do it is that two pointer thing

150
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,960
yeah

151
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,479
you know two points i think one two

152
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,479
three four five

153
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,479
[Music]

154
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,800
so we have that

155
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,800
now we

156
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,400
okay so we have left we have learned

157
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,639
numbers ready now the next step is to

158
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,680
merge them yeah so how do we imagine we

159
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,520
pick one number from each yeah

160
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,800
do you still remember how we merged two

161
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,520
saltines

162
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,199
i

163
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,800
bridge how do we merge two certainties

164
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,800
how do we measure two points i think

165
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,720
pick one from each other and then move

166
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,039
yeah yeah

167
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,120
so we can do this answer

168
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:03,120
because i'll empty this

169
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:07,520
and then let's say

170
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:09,280
i equals j equals you know y

171
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,520
i smaller than

172
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,680
we start from the even number length

173
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,960
even

174
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,039
and

175
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,960
j smaller than lens odd

176
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:23,520
and then we pick one from the event we

177
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,240
pick one from the other answer

178
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,240
dot append

179
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:32,720
even

180
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:34,479
i answer the append yeah we pick

181
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,400
we pick in turn

182
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,639
one we pick one even number and then we

183
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,639
pick one other number okay

184
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,120
yeah

185
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:46,720
and then we move the pointer i plus

186
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:49,840
equals 1 j plus equals 1

187
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,360
okay so now come on yeah as you can see

188
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:55,199
you can see that

189
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:57,120
possibly okay possibly the even number

190
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,879
could have one more

191
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,520
yeah could have one more

192
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,919
element than the odd number right

193
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,919
all right

194
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,000
so look at then we can we need to say if

195
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:12,000
i

196
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,160
is smaller than lens even number

197
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
okay then we append

198
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,800
the the remaining

199
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,520
even number okay so which is answer

200
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,520
dot append

201
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,800
even

202
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,560
what even i okay

203
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,840
or even minus one because it's always

204
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,080
the last one

205
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:36,320
is is it possible that the odd has more

206
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:38,080
than more element than even number

207
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,800
okay one two

208
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,800
three four

209
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,720
it means that the numbers start even

210
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,240
index so this yellow one two three it's

211
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,519
no means let's

212
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,519
okay but that's a good question

213
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,760
like okay

214
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:02,880
yeah so what the one question is a

215
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,399
little bit come on one question is that

216
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,120
if reason

217
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,480
come on if the array has five numbers so

218
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,480
we have three

219
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,480
numbers let's start with the even index

220
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,880
and two start with the

221
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,160
odds right is it possible the odd has

222
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,040
more

223
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,080
elements than the even yeah

224
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,279
no

225
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:25,519
okay let's say six numbers and if there

226
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:28,080
if that the original array has the even

227
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,320
number of numbers then both array will

228
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,120
contain the same element right if i have

229
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,200
one more element

230
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,440
if i have one more element do they have

231
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,080
a does they have to do

232
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,959
i mean does it have to be even

233
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,959
that's what i'm asking

234
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:48,959
you know yeah

235
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,560
one two three four five six

236
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,600
so that

237
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,279
yeah

238
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,120
so that that's the

239
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,440
even index

240
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,920
if i add one more

241
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:03,600
let's see

242
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:08,320
so look now even has four other has has

243
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,320
three hey you are you're saying that um

244
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,480
yeah yeah yeah okay if i put another

245
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,920
more

246
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:18,079
so look one three five seven and two

247
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,519
four six eight the same i know if i put

248
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:22,399
one more

249
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,320
one three five seven nine

250
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:28,720
okay so the even

251
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:32,160
the even array is off is always

252
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,920
more than the odd number

253
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,800
all the same yeah why is that why is

254
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,560
that

255
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,959
because the even in that start with the

256
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,200
first one right because the first index

257
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:44,720
is always even right so the event gets

258
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:47,120
to pick first that's why we only

259
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,680
we we can only uh

260
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,920
we can only have more even numbers you

261
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,360
know or equal even numbers than all

262
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,720
numbers okay

263
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,200
yeah

264
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,200
make sense

265
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:03,120
the other way of doing this okay this is

266
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,440
a bit lensing another implementation so

267
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:09,519
we can chip it

268
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,519
look what's different what's different

269
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:15,839
what's a dip

270
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,839
like what i'm wearing

271
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,040
so if we dip it right

272
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:25,680
yeah we can tip it okay so hope we can

273
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:27,040
tip it so we can rewrite this this bit

274
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,360
so we can say

275
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,440
four x y

276
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,519
in chip

277
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,920
okay

278
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,680
start with the even number yeah

279
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,680
chip longest okay

280
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,680
why is that because the

281
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,160
the even and the odd may not have the

282
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,760
same length okay so cheap long is

283
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,959
even

284
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,040
odd

285
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:51,600
and i can say answer

286
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,600
not a pen

287
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:56,399
x okay so i have to check if x answer

288
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:59,760
doesn't appear x if y

289
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,760
answer don't attend y okay

290
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,120
i know b return return answer right

291
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:13,360
baby

292
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:15,360
we have to check if the x is that it is

293
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,079
not long right because the chipmunk is

294
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,800
may produce the lung

295
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:23,600
okay so look here

296
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,120
a equals 1 2

297
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,720
b equals

298
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,440
three four

299
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,839
five so the deep longest

300
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,480
deep longest will produce

301
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,279
an array of one tree

302
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,279
right

303
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,800
look that's how it did

304
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,720
look

305
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,880
you're looking cheap

306
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,040
one three two four

307
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,200
but look there's no element here but how

308
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,680
to chip with five

309
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,040
so you have a lump

310
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,160
five okay

311
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,160
that's the cheap longest

312
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,639
if we don't have enough element at the

313
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,200
corresponding

314
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,240
five right so we use the nine so but the

315
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,279
chip

316
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,880
chip

317
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,959
if it's a chip function it will just

318
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,360
return one three two four right but if

319
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,720
it's the cheap longest yeah

320
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,440
your pet

321
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,320
will pack the actual element with the

322
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,120
number

323
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:20,800
okay let's eat that

324
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:23,279
okay actually the most uh quicker way to

325
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,600
implement this is this look because we

326
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:28,880
already have the other even here so we

327
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,639
can substitute right we can do this

328
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,040
we can just do this

329
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,040
nums

330
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:46,000
the second one every other element equal

331
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:48,240
okay so this is the tuple assignment

332
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,160
okay i want to replace

333
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,240
i want to replace the elements in the

334
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:55,040
numbers array start from the first one

335
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:58,320
every other element come on look at me

336
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:00,720
and i want to replace the elements

337
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,880
start with the second element every

338
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,040
other element skip one

339
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,120
equals what equals this this is the

340
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,920
topic right so we just have to

341
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,760
to

342
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,240
do this okay

343
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:15,240
yeah you see

344
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,240
okay

345
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,760
which one you think is the better

346
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,519
we choose this one the shortest one

347
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,880
which one is the shortest one

348
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,920
um

349
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:27,440
numbers what did i just say here

350
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,079
and we talked about this the other day

351
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,079
right remember

352
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:33,279
[Music]

353
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,199
yeah

354
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,880
do you get this one

355
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,720
okay so can you tell me how can we solve

356
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,720
this problem

357
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,720
bye

358
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,800
n is the number of elements in the ray

359
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:11,279
okay so actually we sort it twice also

360
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,440
on divided by two log

361
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:15,440
log n divided by 2 yeah

362
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,760
plus this yeah

363
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,760
plus

364
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:24,079
but we we're going to simplify this

365
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,399
right look y side of n divided by 2

366
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,519
this is constant yeah

367
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:31,759
log

368
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:33,279
look log a times b equals one

369
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,199
equals one

370
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,120
equals log a

371
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,560
plus log b

372
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,600
so log

373
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,519
a divided by b equals log a

374
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,360
minus log b okay

375
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:48,560
yeah

376
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:52,079
oh yeah look so this this one

377
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,839
log n divided by 2 equals log n

378
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:56,320
minus log

379
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:58,480
so this is a constant we drop it

380
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,399
yes so you can actually log in

381
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,720
so login

382
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,920
login plus login

383
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,199
half

384
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:09,040
so half is actually o and login okay so

385
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:11,279
still nothing

386
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,279
okay

387
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,880
so one more thing one more thing come on

388
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,880
come on

389
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,720
what's this

390
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,680
what's this

391
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,680
what's this what's this

392
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:31,360
okay so this one so okay so okay the

393
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,800
number is this one yes zero one two

394
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,120
three

395
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,759
four okay so can you tell me

396
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,279
numbs column common two is which tune

397
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,839
which numbers

398
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:43,040
which number means this one

399
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,320
um

400
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,519
zero to

401
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:50,240
four okay and num one column column two

402
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:53,120
yeah exactly so that means that means

403
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,160
that this one i want to replace

404
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,480
yeah

405
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:59,440
replace these three numbers

406
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:02,079
with the salted one with the

407
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,400
oyster even which is salty and this i

408
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:06,720
want to remove i replace this number

409
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,720
this number with the sorted reverse

410
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:12,000
reverse equal to okay

411
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:15,039
easy yeah impression that's easy okay

412
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,160
let's using the python syntax

413
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,480
this

414
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,720
this this comprehension

415
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,640
yeah but we know that the general idea

416
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,959
is what is to

417
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,959
separate the array into half right

418
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,840
separate into half and then

419
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,520
sort it both and then

420
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,840
merge it

421
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:36,960
okay when we talk about how to merge to

422
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,799
saute this yeah how do we look if this

423
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,520
is too salty this look

424
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:44,480
one three five seven

425
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:46,960
at least i thought it is two four

426
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:50,960
six eight okay we have two salty bees

427
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:54,320
and another ten okay look okay ryan

428
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:57,919
this is a this is b come on how can i

429
00:17:54,320 --> 00:18:00,880
sort it these two arrays uh smudge to

430
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,880
sort it away

431
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:15,589
you take the smallest one okay i move it

432
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:15,589
[Music]

433
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,600
always take the smallest one okay that's

434
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,600
it for today

435
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,600
bye
