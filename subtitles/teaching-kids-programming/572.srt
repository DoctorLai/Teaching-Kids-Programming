1
00:00:05,779 --> 00:00:11,880
oh no this is a square actually

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:14,820
Square so this is 90 degrees Each corner

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:19,199
obviously this side is one one one one

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:20,699
this size two two two okay so guess

5
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,199
what's the question

6
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:24,000
what's the side

7
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:26,220
which one

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,359
smooth Square which is slightly okay

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:31,560
yeah that's good

10
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,620
so most of you know this is a square

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,420
because because they will decide because

12
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:39,239
well if those questions is wobblies

13
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:42,660
because look all of these are the same

14
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:45,680
like one two one two one two these are

15
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,680
the same yeah

16
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:51,480
these are the same look these right and

17
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,820
these right this is two this is two this

18
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:57,480
is one this is one and this angle is the

19
00:00:53,820 --> 00:01:01,260
same as end so these two triangles are

20
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:04,100
identical so that means this angle is

21
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:07,140
the same as this angle all right

22
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:08,400
yeah these angle plus this angle how

23
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,460
much

24
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,340
if in this triangle 90 degrees all right

25
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:17,220
this class list is 90 and I'm just

26
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,680
saying this is equal this all right yeah

27
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:23,580
so this plus this is 90 degrees right

28
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:26,700
yeah so 100 minus 90 this is 90. okay

29
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,740
you're right yeah yeah but this anger is

30
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,560
not the same as this anger this anger is

31
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:34,320
the same as this angle makes it yeah

32
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:37,259
look yeah yeah but I'm saying like it

33
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,180
feels good five then then that is 45 and

34
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:40,920
then and then that one will be 40.

35
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,500
that's not 45 because this is one this

36
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,560
is two it's 45.

37
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:49,259
if it's 45 in what cases it's 45 this is

38
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,020
two this is two so it's in a meter

39
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:54,740
in the middle then it's 45 right because

40
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,960
in the right triangle

41
00:01:54,740 --> 00:02:00,899
if this side equals this side

42
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,780
then this is 45 degree I'm right okay

43
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:06,180
but if this is not the same this is not

44
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,340
45 if this side is not equal to this

45
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:11,160
angle is not the same these two ends

46
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:14,040
added up together 90 degree okay yeah

47
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,959
okay very good very good okay we have to

48
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,520
ask ourselves why is it Square okay so

49
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:19,379
you prove your point this is a square

50
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,379
okay so we want to calculate the size of

51
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:26,400
the square so what's the strategy so you

52
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:29,220
figure out the area yes the area so you

53
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,360
need to find out you need you need to

54
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,700
find out

55
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,459
this line so you can just basically

56
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:38,280
count it by four okay to find out that

57
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:40,260
line you have to find out the triangle

58
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,700
is like here you need to find out this

59
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,800
one

60
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:46,260
okay so actually there was a move hey

61
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,239
because this is too easy right if I'm

62
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:50,060
saying like this is two this is one I

63
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,099
can get this right

64
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:54,180
this is a this is p this is a 90 degree

65
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:57,420
what's this

66
00:02:54,180 --> 00:03:01,860
if this is C if this is the right angle

67
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:05,519
this is a this is B this is right angle

68
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,519
90 degrees right

69
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:13,620
you said right okay okay

70
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:16,080
APC what's DC

71
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:18,720
remember a squared plus b square equals

72
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:22,640
c Square this is very important right if

73
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,640
this is three this is four what's this

74
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,080
five yeah okay remember that very very

75
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:30,080
important okay

76
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,080
okay

77
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,900
are you confident no it doesn't look

78
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,000
like

79
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:41,340
okay so let's remove the black lines

80
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,599
okay how about how about that that point

81
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,299
to D

82
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:48,560
wait yeah you're right yeah uh

83
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:48,560
the point today

84
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:55,760
yeah yeah yeah yeah

85
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:58,019
okay so easily is

86
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,940
slightly different right previous one

87
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:02,159
that was easy because you can usually

88
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:04,500
you can decide if they see the square

89
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:07,860
will be C square right that's the area

90
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:11,780
of that square but for this one is this

91
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,780
a rectangle you have to

92
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:18,419
where

93
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:21,359
to remove it with a rectangle you need

94
00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:25,380
to prove that it has 90 degree a right

95
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:26,460
angle yeah so do we know this is this a

96
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,840
953

97
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,080
yeah

98
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,160
uh

99
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,860
this is

100
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,900
a right angle why is this a red line

101
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,580
because it's a triangle and it's like

102
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,680
this

103
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,419
how do you know this is a triangle this

104
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,840
is the thing how do you I can visually

105
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:47,880
see it this is mathematic but the way

106
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,460
you see it you need to prove it okay so

107
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:53,280
we don't know maybe you know this is the

108
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:55,919
homework for you today okay because this

109
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:59,220
is half this is half

110
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:01,380
why is it half because it's half no it's

111
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,360
not half it's not half the only thing

112
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:05,100
you can do is that because this is one

113
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,600
this is two the whole size three all

114
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,520
right this is one this is two this is

115
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,160
one so this is the three one this is

116
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,900
three one so these two triangles are a

117
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,960
straight identical right it's the same

118
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:18,180
three identical all right so

119
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:21,660
yeah but so what does it mean so it

120
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:24,960
means that it means this angle is the

121
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:27,660
same as this angle right yeah so these

122
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,940
endoplasm this angle is 90 degrees so

123
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,919
this is

124
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:34,160
identity right if it's 90 degrees this

125
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,160
is

126
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,620
I just prove it cut it look don't get it

127
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,880
you don't get okay okay

128
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:45,000
look at this this

129
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:48,080
yeah please try and all right is it the

130
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,080
same as this triangle

131
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:53,280
yeah because this side is three this

132
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,440
side is three this style is one this

133
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,800
size one right and this is the right

134
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,600
angle this is the line all right yes

135
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:02,220
this angle is the same as this angle

136
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,840
right yeah

137
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:06,360
makes us

138
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,759
okay so this and the plus this angle is

139
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,680
90 degrees this small angle plus this

140
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:13,500
small angle is a 90 degree one right

141
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:16,199
yeah I just said this angle is equal

142
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:19,340
this angle right yeah so this angle

143
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:19,340
France this angle is what

144
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:30,900
yeah so this is 90 degrees right yeah

145
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:32,699
okay so this is 90 degrees this is 90

146
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,080
degrees this is 92 in the same right

147
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:38,639
understand because I can prove it

148
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:41,280
similarly the angle inside but

149
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,919
in inside the rectangle is also 90

150
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,600
degrees at least

151
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:47,759
one inside okay because this is a

152
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,819
straight line if one of the angle is 90

153
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:53,819
degrees it's just said this is 180 minus

154
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:56,639
90 this must be 90. yeah okay we want to

155
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:58,860
calculate this area the size

156
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,720
so your strategy is calculate this side

157
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:02,340
right yeah

158
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,680
that could work but what's the other

159
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:06,240
strategy because it's hard maybe hard to

160
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,539
calculately side right if you calculate

161
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,699
at least it's C then C Square do you do

162
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:13,259
something with the numbers no no just

163
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:15,060
forget about the number I will just say

164
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:17,220
we want to calculate at least how many

165
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,900
ways we can calculate this one way which

166
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:21,240
is very good is calculate one side

167
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:23,580
because this is a square right yeah you

168
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,199
see the square of the tangle yeah we

169
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:27,180
have to prove is a square obviously

170
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,699
right yeah because the numbers outside

171
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:32,520
please because mathematics you have to

172
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:35,340
be very very accurate

173
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:37,199
active Square first of all you have to

174
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:40,020
prove this square right

175
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,120
in order to use these right now this is

176
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:44,699
a square right and each side we know so

177
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,440
we know the size of everything

178
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:49,940
and we learn the size of everything we

179
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,940
just have to get rid of

180
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:55,319
the outside to the subtract many sense

181
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,220
okay so how many triangle we need to

182
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:59,099
subtract

183
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:01,139
therefore right look which which side do

184
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:04,380
we need to subtract four times in this

185
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:06,380
one this one one

186
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,380
two

187
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,840
three

188
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:15,479
four all right yeah right so we just

189
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,940
need to figure out this triangle right

190
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:19,979
the size of it yeah yeah but if you can

191
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:22,259
that's basically doing the same thing

192
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:24,599
because you have to figure out the

193
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:26,639
triangles

194
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:29,520
yes you have to pick up we're trying

195
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:33,060
Booth to subtract it so it's so

196
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:35,459
basically will be as e as uh easy as

197
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:37,260
you're figuring out the side it's pretty

198
00:08:35,459 --> 00:08:39,120
similar pretty similar but this is the

199
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:41,399
opposite right you're saying calculating

200
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,560
this which is nice yeah I'm saying that

201
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:45,720
I want to calculate this side and I want

202
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:47,459
to do this yeah if you want to calculate

203
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,040
that triangle you need to subtract it

204
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:53,040
okay so you have to figure out the

205
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:55,500
triangle as well as in the other method

206
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,420
that I was saying so yeah you you'll

207
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:00,120
figure it out one side that's right okay

208
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:02,820
so the answer is sabcd the whole thing

209
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:06,300
minus four times

210
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:11,279
this moment let's say this is e okay 4

211
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:14,220
times s a b e right s a b is this one

212
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:17,820
right four times does it make sense

213
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:21,420
this one is three times three nine right

214
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:24,720
yeah we know that right yeah

215
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:27,440
this triangle a b c

216
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,440
this one

217
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:32,339
p e f

218
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:35,279
it's just bigger it's just bigger

219
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:37,980
similar okay if I'm telling you the

220
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:40,320
angle a is the same as energy the angle

221
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:42,420
B the same as angry then these two

222
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,660
triangles are similar what's similar so

223
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:47,760
you just shift it Transit transition

224
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:50,760
or you rotate

225
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,560
right and rotate

226
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:56,300
why it could be flipped

227
00:09:52,560 --> 00:10:00,060
you could be Millions oh yeah yeah okay

228
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:02,519
or another way is a scale right you make

229
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:06,360
it because think this is called similar

230
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:12,000
triangle if two triangles are similar if

231
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:14,220
a b to d e is K right if this side

232
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,399
divided by this side is K if this K is

233
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:21,260
number okay so we know that all the

234
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:21,260
corresponding size is K

235
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:26,220
the ratio is okay and the angles

236
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:28,860
corresponding angles are the same angle

237
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:30,660
p is the same as angle e the angular C

238
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:33,360
is the angular F right

239
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:36,000
or even a medium if I pick the middle of

240
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:39,240
one side this is Mu pick the number of

241
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,279
one side and okay so this is called the

242
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,560
medium

243
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:47,180
a n

244
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:51,779
divided by T M is also okay how about

245
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:55,680
the size of ABC area divided by size of

246
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:57,240
uh d e f what's this if it's similar

247
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,000
it's two similar so what should I put

248
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,620
here is it something to do with K yes of

249
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,500
course

250
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:07,440
the size of the ABC is

251
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:11,339
PC times this height right times this

252
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:13,740
height the size of t f is T times this

253
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:15,660
height this is K this is K this is K

254
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:18,839
this is K so times together K Square

255
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:20,640
okay yeah

256
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:22,980
okay this is called similar triangle

257
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:26,040
Okay so similar triangle there are a

258
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:28,620
couple of ways to determine two angles

259
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:31,380
angle angle if there are two times the

260
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:32,700
two angles are same they are similar is

261
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:36,420
three sides

262
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:38,899
are proportional or the same then they

263
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,899
are similar

264
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:45,060
and another one if two sides and then

265
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,800
corresponding angle are the same then

266
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:48,480
they're similar for example look this is

267
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,899
the trend line

268
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,940
if I draw a parallel line okay this

269
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:56,579
triangle this angle is the same as this

270
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:58,560
triangle this angle this angle parallel

271
00:11:56,579 --> 00:12:00,720
right this angle is the same this angle

272
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,959
is the same as this so This triangle is

273
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:06,959
similar to this triangle okay

274
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:09,000
is the same as this angle

275
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:13,019
this side

276
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,279
to this side is the same as this side to

277
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:16,440
this side

278
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:19,040
then these two triangles are similar

279
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:22,620
right yeah how about

280
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:24,420
SSA this is not so these two are

281
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:28,620
obviously not similar right

282
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:31,740
this a here this B this C this D

283
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:34,380
and this angle is the same this angle is

284
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:37,320
the same okay this angle

285
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:39,959
yeah this angle is the same but a to c

286
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:42,120
is the same as B to D

287
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:45,180
this angle is the same as this angle

288
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:47,820
they are obviously not similar

289
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:50,160
make sense it's just like the top part

290
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:52,620
is the same yeah look at this one I can

291
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,600
I can rotate these

292
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:56,940
there's a possibility this angle right

293
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,040
this angle is the center but I'm just

294
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:01,019
saying look for example here right I can

295
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,760
put it this side for example let's just

296
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:05,279
compare when they are equal right this

297
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,899
is the same as this right and then I'm

298
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,899
just saying this angle is the same as

299
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:13,760
this one so look here

300
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:13,760
yeah all right I can put it here

301
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:19,680
but within this one I get

302
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:20,639
longer I mean I can just put it here

303
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,620
yeah

304
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,180
yeah

305
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:26,519
the bottom line is longer than the

306
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:28,500
longer

307
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:30,680
no it's no longer it's the same it's the

308
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,680
same

309
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:39,800
yeah I just put it here when you do like

310
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:43,440
meow yeah

311
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:46,440
it's possible to find these right to the

312
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:50,180
center right it's geometry so this is

313
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,180
not right it's just these three cases

314
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:56,100
a right triangle what do you call the

315
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:58,940
triangle with the right and what do you

316
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,940
call it all right

317
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:11,339
if one of the angle is the same then

318
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:14,100
obviously it's two angles right that are

319
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:16,800
similar I if okay this is a special case

320
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:19,139
if one side the longest side

321
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,000
longest side and one of the other side

322
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:23,100
are proportional they are similar

323
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,519
identical triangles are similar right

324
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:28,019
yes identical trials mean okay so we

325
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:29,880
want to find out this right these two

326
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:31,740
triangles are similar right similar

327
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,779
right they're actually identical

328
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:35,700
identical triangles are similar I want

329
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:37,200
to calculate an area of these right at

330
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,459
least I want to know this and I want to

331
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,220
know this right because this is the

332
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:43,620
right angle I if I know this I notice I

333
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:46,320
know the area right if the right angle

334
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:49,019
triangle if this is a this is p the size

335
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,880
is a times B divided by two right yeah

336
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:51,959
so I want to calculate at least I want

337
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,300
to calculate

338
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:55,920
right so we know this side right along

339
00:14:54,300 --> 00:15:00,120
this side yeah inside

340
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:02,399
this is uh let's put it f d f what's DF

341
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,459
DF is it equals to look look at this

342
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:08,820
triangle uh triangle okay

343
00:15:04,459 --> 00:15:09,959
dfy this is T this is FY so this this

344
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,940
side

345
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:14,660
this side is one right we know right

346
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,660
yeah

347
00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:21,959
80. this this 18 83 right yeah yeah so

348
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:24,300
this side we know right a squared plus b

349
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:27,660
squared equals c squared so a squares

350
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:30,720
nine plus one ten ten Square so this one

351
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:35,779
is square root of 10 right DF is square

352
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,779
root of ten doesn't have no

353
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:44,220
sorry 80. we want to calculate a g and

354
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:46,500
GT right a g and GD okay A G and GT this

355
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:51,600
triangle right is similar to this

356
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:51,600
triangle so this these

357
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:05,220
these two these to let is similar to

358
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:09,000
this to that three two two lists right

359
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:10,860
yeah so equals three two this this is

360
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,199
the longest side which which we just get

361
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:16,680
it which is a square root of 10.

362
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:18,079
okay so we can get this AG what's a g a

363
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,820
g is

364
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:24,839
is three divided by square root of 10

365
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:29,600
right okay now we just need to calculate

366
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:29,600
PG right but look at this the triangle

367
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:35,639
this side is three right this side is

368
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:37,980
three and a g three over ten right three

369
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:41,220
over ten square root of ten and I can

370
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:44,399
get these right

371
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:48,079
this is the three this is three over

372
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,079
square root ten what's this side

373
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:54,000
Three Square minus B squared equals nine

374
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:57,060
divided by ten

375
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:02,579
so equals this is nine right

376
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:05,459
81 81 over 10 81 over 10 square root

377
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:08,579
okay so what's this is

378
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:11,880
square root of ten nine right okay so

379
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:14,400
this side equals this so t g

380
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:17,640
equals that

381
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:21,059
okay a g equals what this one

382
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:22,860
so what's the area these times this

383
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:25,860
divided by 2 right

384
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:28,640
square root of 10 times 10 yes

385
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:28,640
pen

386
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:35,880
27 divided by two

387
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,640
Point twenty okay and I need to times

388
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:41,520
four times right times four times

389
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,500
makes sense because this is just one I

390
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:46,940
need to transform all right so this is

391
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,940
27 over 5.

392
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:57,600
5.4 5.4 yeah okay 5.4 the overall is

393
00:17:54,780 --> 00:18:01,080
nine nine minus 5.4

394
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,539
6 okay this is Panzer the area this size

395
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,340
is 3.6

396
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:07,020
okay so to sum up we want to pick a

397
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:09,900
release speed the first of all we need

398
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:11,520
to prove this is a square how do we

399
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:13,440
prove this is a square I just tell you

400
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,600
right because this triangle is the same

401
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,419
as this triangle so this angle is the

402
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,940
same as this angle this plus this is 90

403
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:22,980
degrees therefore this first list is 90

404
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:25,559
degree and in this triangle to end up

405
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:28,020
adding up 93 so this must be 90 degrees

406
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:29,940
so this 90 degree because it's straight

407
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:32,580
line so this must be knighted quick and

408
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:34,740
I can prove using a similar way these

409
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:36,660
are 90 degrees right your approach is

410
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:39,120
the second least bit right which is all

411
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:41,100
right my Approach is to calculate one

412
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,020
time and multiply four times four times

413
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:45,419
and subtract from the entire Square

414
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:47,160
which is nine okay so how do we

415
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:50,039
calculate this we want to know this side

416
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:52,740
and this side right because the for a

417
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:55,320
given time if this is a this is B the

418
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:56,760
area is a times B divided by two right

419
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,500
how do we get this side we use the

420
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:01,980
similar triangle yeah talk about similar

421
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:05,280
triangle two angles are the same similar

422
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:07,500
three sides as proportional all the same

423
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,840
similar

424
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:12,539
two sides and their corresponding angles

425
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,880
are the same similar okay this is the

426
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:17,460
base of three cases okay an identical

427
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,280
triangles are similar okay and using

428
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:22,620
that we can do this equation right this

429
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:24,360
side as to this side right because it's

430
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:27,120
the same and this side to this side is

431
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:29,580
the same as this side to this side and

432
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:32,340
along this side we know we notice a

433
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:34,620
equation and this is a this is B this is

434
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:36,660
C 90 degree so a square plus b square

435
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:39,480
equals c squared right so once we can

436
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:41,280
decide now we can use the same thing we

437
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,799
know this C we know this a and we know

438
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:46,080
this B right because C Square minus a

439
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:48,419
square equals P Square right and then if

440
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,740
we Square it okay what have you learned

441
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:50,700
today

442
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:55,200
about

443
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:58,799
the area so let me learning about this

444
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:02,280
this square the square and there's a

445
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:04,140
small square inside it s two and we want

446
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:08,360
to find the area of that smaller Square

447
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:13,860
so so to find out we

448
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:16,799
real your approach is is to find a area

449
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:20,039
of a triangle of it on the outside of

450
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:23,700
the smaller square and times it by four

451
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:26,220
and subtract it from the area of the

452
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:34,140
whole Square we know that it's a

453
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:38,520
rectangle as the a as the as the square

454
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:43,020
it's the corners is obviously 90 degrees

455
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:48,179
and that corner like where like a is

456
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:53,460
and the triangle a a to f a to d decimal

457
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:57,780
triangle is identical to the D to one so

458
00:20:53,460 --> 00:21:01,200
we know that those two is 90 degrees and

459
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:04,640
then since it does a straight line down

460
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,640
from a to

461
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:12,840
so we know that it's 90 degrees so

462
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:15,360
there's you know just a rectangle a

463
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:19,140
square is a type of rectangle just

464
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:21,860
special that's good thank you bye-bye

465
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,860
foreign
