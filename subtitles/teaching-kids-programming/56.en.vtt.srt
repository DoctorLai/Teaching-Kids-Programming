welcome okay so how about today i give
 

9
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,790
welcome okay so how about today i give
you a very

10
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:16,800
you a very
 

11
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,189
you a very
big list and let's say

12
00:00:21,189 --> 00:00:21,199
big list and let's say
 

13
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,590
big list and let's say
these these the list is consists of

14
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:23,600
these these the list is consists of
 

15
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,109
these these the list is consists of
zeros yes

16
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:25,119
zeros yes
 

17
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,950
zeros yes
and once but once it becomes one

18
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:28,960
and once but once it becomes one
 

19
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,910
and once but once it becomes one
and then you'll be all ones okay yeah so

20
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:31,920
and then you'll be all ones okay yeah so
 

21
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,790
and then you'll be all ones okay yeah so
you'll be separate

22
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:32,800
you'll be separate
 

23
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,510
you'll be separate
between zero and once but the thing is

24
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:35,520
between zero and once but the thing is
 

25
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,110
between zero and once but the thing is
you don't know

26
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:37,120
you don't know
 

27
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,030
you don't know
you don't know so this is the first

28
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:41,040
you don't know so this is the first
 

29
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,110
you don't know so this is the first
index one okay let's say one okay and

30
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:43,120
index one okay let's say one okay and
 

31
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:43,590
index one okay let's say one okay and
this is

32
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:43,600
this is
 

33
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,310
this is
n you know the size is one and n all

34
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:46,320
n you know the size is one and n all
 

35
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,150
n you know the size is one and n all
right

36
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:48,160
right
 

37
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,310
right
yeah and then you can have a function to

38
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:50,320
yeah and then you can have a function to
 

39
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,350
yeah and then you can have a function to
call it like

40
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:51,360
call it like
 

41
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,549
call it like
check checklist

42
00:00:54,549 --> 00:00:54,559
check checklist
 

43
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,990
check checklist
check if given an integer a then if

44
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:58,000
check if given an integer a then if
 

45
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,389
check if given an integer a then if
it's you will return the value of zero

46
00:01:00,389 --> 00:01:00,399
it's you will return the value of zero
 

47
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:01,750
it's you will return the value of zero
and one okay given

48
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:01,760
and one okay given
 

49
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,950
and one okay given
if you check locally check one

50
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:04,960
if you check locally check one
 

51
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,070
if you check locally check one
is zero okay okay

52
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:08,080
is zero okay okay
 

53
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,750
is zero okay okay
check two three four five five

54
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:11,760
check two three four five five
 

55
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,190
check two three four five five
is one okay so your task is to use this

56
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:15,200
is one okay so your task is to use this
 

57
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,710
is one okay so your task is to use this
check function

58
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:16,720
check function
 

59
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,910
check function
to find first first

60
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:19,920
to find first first
 

61
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,190
to find first first
one i understand yeah so in this

62
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:25,200

 

63
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,749

three four case yeah yeah because this

64
00:01:27,749 --> 00:01:27,759
three four case yeah yeah because this
 

65
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,510
three four case yeah yeah because this
is the first

66
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:29,520
is the first
 

67
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,830
is the first
time it becomes one okay

68
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:33,840
time it becomes one okay
 

69
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,590
time it becomes one okay
i don't want you to give me the four

70
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:35,600
i don't want you to give me the four
 

71
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,270
i don't want you to give me the four
because it's zero i don't want you to

72
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:37,280
because it's zero i don't want you to
 

73
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,550
because it's zero i don't want you to
give me six because

74
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:38,560
give me six because
 

75
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,550
give me six because
it's the second one i want you to give

76
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:40,560
it's the second one i want you to give
 

77
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,030
it's the second one i want you to give
me five

78
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,040
me five
 

79
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,670
me five
any idea how do i so we just draw a list

80
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:47,680
any idea how do i so we just draw a list
 

81
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,710
any idea how do i so we just draw a list
and then check which

82
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:50,720
and then check which
 

83
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,149
and then check which
number define let's say

84
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:54,159
number define let's say
 

85
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,190
number define let's say
uh first first

86
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:57,200
uh first first
 

87
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,789
uh first first
first bet okay bad breath

88
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:00,799
first bet okay bad breath
 

89
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,149
first bet okay bad breath
bad and now let's call it m okay

90
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:04,159
bad and now let's call it m okay
 

91
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,270
bad and now let's call it m okay
we are given this n right yeah

92
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:07,280
we are given this n right yeah
 

93
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,469
we are given this n right yeah
yeah okay so now normally what would you

94
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:10,479
yeah okay so now normally what would you
 

95
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:10,869
yeah okay so now normally what would you
do

96
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:10,879
do
 

97
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,070
do
normally what would you do i

98
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:14,080
normally what would you do i
 

99
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,830
normally what would you do i
just count it from one

100
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:17,840
just count it from one
 

101
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,390
just count it from one
so you just say okay if this is one if

102
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:20,400
so you just say okay if this is one if
 

103
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,110
so you just say okay if this is one if
this is one

104
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:21,120
this is one
 

105
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,710
this is one
this is one if this is one if this is

106
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:22,720
this is one if this is one if this is
 

107
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,229
this is one if this is one if this is
one return yeah

108
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:24,239
one return yeah
 

109
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,270
one return yeah
yeah yeah so how would you do that four

110
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:27,280
yeah yeah so how would you do that four
 

111
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,670
yeah yeah so how would you do that four
i in range

112
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:31,680
i in range
 

113
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,949
i in range
one m plus one okay you know what is n

114
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:34,959
one m plus one okay you know what is n
 

115
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,030
one m plus one okay you know what is n
plus one

116
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:37,040
plus one
 

117
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,710
plus one
well you go one each time n plus one

118
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:40,720
well you go one each time n plus one
 

119
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,830
well you go one each time n plus one
means the the top the test

120
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:43,840
means the the top the test
 

121
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,190
means the the top the test
the final version final thing we want to

122
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:47,200
the final version final thing we want to
 

123
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,309
the final version final thing we want to
check is x right

124
00:02:48,309 --> 00:02:48,319
check is x right
 

125
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,470
check is x right
it's always minus one of this number and

126
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:50,480
it's always minus one of this number and
 

127
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,670
it's always minus one of this number and
now what do we do

128
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:51,680
now what do we do
 

129
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,070
now what do we do
if check

130
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:56,080

 

131
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,070

check what if we check a

132
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,080
check what if we check a
 

133
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:15,990
check what if we check a
there's no a come on i i yeah we're

134
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,000

 

135
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,470

what's the time capacity i went i won

136
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:20,480
what's the time capacity i went i won
 

137
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,309
what's the time capacity i went i won
oh and yes i went because

138
00:03:24,309 --> 00:03:24,319
oh and yes i went because
 

139
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,750
oh and yes i went because
worst case look we're talking about

140
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:27,760
worst case look we're talking about
 

141
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,030
worst case look we're talking about
another two in the worst case and

142
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,040
another two in the worst case and
 

143
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,309
another two in the worst case and
and not only the last last uh the first

144
00:03:34,309 --> 00:03:34,319
and not only the last last uh the first
 

145
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,910
and not only the last last uh the first
bet that would be the last one yeah then

146
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:35,920
bet that would be the last one yeah then
 

147
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,750
bet that would be the last one yeah then
you'll need to check it you need to

148
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:37,760
you'll need to check it you need to
 

149
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,030
you'll need to check it you need to
check how many times

150
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:39,040
check how many times
 

151
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,149
check how many times
10 times right because lower zero can we

152
00:03:42,149 --> 00:03:42,159
10 times right because lower zero can we
 

153
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,149
10 times right because lower zero can we
do something better

154
00:03:46,149 --> 00:03:46,159
do something better
 

155
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,750
do something better
can we do something better this is all

156
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:47,760
can we do something better this is all
 

157
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,509
can we do something better this is all
this is too slow if you

158
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:49,519
this is too slow if you
 

159
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,910
this is too slow if you
plot this this is

160
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:53,920
plot this this is
 

161
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,509
plot this this is
n right the time time is like that right

162
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:57,519
n right the time time is like that right
 

163
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,990
n right the time time is like that right
yeah this is because n is a minion and

164
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,000
yeah this is because n is a minion and
 

165
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,789
yeah this is because n is a minion and
you need to check

166
00:04:00,789 --> 00:04:00,799
you need to check
 

167
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,949
you need to check
in the worst case a million times which

168
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:02,959
in the worst case a million times which
 

169
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,390
in the worst case a million times which
is too slow

170
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:04,400
is too slow
 

171
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,390
is too slow
yeah can we do can we use the binary

172
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:08,400
yeah can we do can we use the binary
 

173
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,630
yeah can we do can we use the binary
section

174
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:09,640
section
 

175
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,869
section
exercise can we use the final research

176
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:12,879
exercise can we use the final research
 

177
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:17,110
exercise can we use the final research
sorry stretching exercise

178
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:17,120
sorry stretching exercise
 

179
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,390
sorry stretching exercise
can we use the final research

180
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:20,400
can we use the final research
 

181
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,310
can we use the final research
yes look and

182
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:24,320
yes look and
 

183
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,430
yes look and
so this is the left first of all we have

184
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:27,440
so this is the left first of all we have
 

185
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,590
so this is the left first of all we have
a left wing on the right

186
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:29,600
a left wing on the right
 

187
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,670
a left wing on the right
okay now what's the meter meter is

188
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:33,680
okay now what's the meter meter is
 

189
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,030
okay now what's the meter meter is
somewhere here yeah

190
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:35,040
somewhere here yeah
 

191
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,230
somewhere here yeah
somewhere so if the meter

192
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:38,240
somewhere so if the meter
 

193
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,510
somewhere so if the meter
is zero what does it mean in the check

194
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:41,520
is zero what does it mean in the check
 

195
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,749
is zero what does it mean in the check
meter is zero

196
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:43,759
meter is zero
 

197
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,189
meter is zero
what does it mean so where should i go

198
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:47,199
what does it mean so where should i go
 

199
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:52,629
what does it mean so where should i go
to look

200
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:52,639

 

201
00:04:52,639 --> 00:05:00,790

if check middle is zero yes

202
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:00,800

 

203
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,710

what's the answer what where is the

204
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:02,720
what's the answer what where is the
 

205
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,189
what's the answer what where is the
answer is it in the left part or in the

206
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:05,199
answer is it in the left part or in the
 

207
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,070
answer is it in the left part or in the
right part

208
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:06,080
right part
 

209
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,950
right part
if it's zero check meter is zero the

210
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:08,960
if it's zero check meter is zero the
 

211
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,230
if it's zero check meter is zero the
answer is in

212
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:10,240
answer is in
 

213
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,670
answer is in
left and right

214
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:13,680
left and right
 

215
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,510
left and right
if it is yellow of course it's in the

216
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:15,520
if it is yellow of course it's in the
 

217
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,790
if it is yellow of course it's in the
right half right because it's

218
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:16,800
right half right because it's
 

219
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,150
right half right because it's
yellow yeah so what is if

220
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:20,160
yellow yeah so what is if
 

221
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:28,550
yellow yeah so what is if
the answer is one where's the answer

222
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:28,560

 

223
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,070

because we are not sure if it's the

224
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:30,080
because we are not sure if it's the
 

225
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,830
because we are not sure if it's the
first first one right

226
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:31,840
first first one right
 

227
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,110
first first one right
because all others will be be the

228
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:35,120
because all others will be be the
 

229
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,870
because all others will be be the
ones yeah

230
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:38,880
ones yeah
 

231
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,070
ones yeah
so when when check meter is one

232
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:44,080

 

233
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,909

then what we do

234
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:47,919

 

235
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,629

we do this uh right will become

236
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:52,639
we do this uh right will become
 

237
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,710
we do this uh right will become
minus one right if it's the second meter

238
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:56,720
minus one right if it's the second meter
 

239
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,749
minus one right if it's the second meter
is zero so it's

240
00:05:59,749 --> 00:05:59,759
is zero so it's
 

241
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,430
is zero so it's
in the right in the right hand side

242
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:01,440
in the right in the right hand side
 

243
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,670
in the right in the right hand side
right so left will become one

244
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:05,680

 

245
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,350

become right me the plus one okay come

246
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:09,360
become right me the plus one okay come
 

247
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,230
become right me the plus one okay come
on

yeah here and here
if the middle is one so which lines are

292
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:35,840
if the middle is one so which lines are
 

293
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,070
if the middle is one so which lines are
going to be

294
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:38,080
going to be
 

295
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,990
going to be
in the left left hand side so what

in the left left hand side so what
 

297
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,070
in the left left hand side so what
then we need to set the right part

298
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:46,080
then we need to set the right part
 

299
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,430
then we need to set the right part
to the middle minus one right yeah

300
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:49,440
to the middle minus one right yeah
 

301
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,230
to the middle minus one right yeah
this is okay i know what's here if it's

apples and okay uh
actually it will be n minus one because

406
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:03,519
actually it will be n minus one because
 

407
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,150
actually it will be n minus one because
we the index starts on zero and then we

408
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:06,160
we the index starts on zero and then we
 

409
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:06,710
we the index starts on zero and then we
are given

410
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:06,720
are given
 

411
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:16,710
are given
from i yeah okay so let's see

412
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:16,720

00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:26,880
bet one version one okay why is it bad
 

419
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,710
bet one version one okay why is it bad
yeah i don't know whatever you want

420

00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:30,640
let's do it
 

423
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,750
let's do it
so let's for i in range

424
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:33,760
so let's for i in range
 

425
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,630
so let's for i in range
one let's see how many how many of these

426
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:36,640
one let's see how many how many of these
 

427
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,110
one let's see how many how many of these
two

428
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:37,120
two
 

429
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,430
two
fours two four

430
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:41,440
fours two four
 

431
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,870
fours two four
a 10 right so let's do it 10

432
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:44,880
a 10 right so let's do it 10
 

433
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,790
a 10 right so let's do it 10
part 11 oh yeah

434
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:48,800
part 11 oh yeah
 

435
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,550
part 11 oh yeah
and then if check

436
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:52,560
and then if check
 

437
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:59,110
and then if check
i equals one

438
00:11:59,110 --> 00:11:59,120

 

439
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,910

it means to check okay it's not a sign

440
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:01,920
it means to check okay it's not a sign
 

441
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,430
it means to check okay it's not a sign
one way you want to check is double

442
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:03,440
one way you want to check is double
 

443
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,470
one way you want to check is double
equal okay

444
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:04,480
equal okay
 

445
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,150
equal okay
let's see find the bad one

446
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:08,160
let's see find the bad one
 

447
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,949
let's see find the bad one
so it should give me one one two three

448
00:12:10,949 --> 00:12:10,959
so it should give me one one two three
 

449
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:11,910
so it should give me one one two three
four five six

450
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:11,920
four five six
 

451
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,509
four five six
right i i hope you will give me a

452
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:15,519
right i i hope you will give me a
 

453
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,030
right i i hope you will give me a
six yes

454
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:19,040

 

455
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,590

and then let's do this the final version

456
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:21,600
and then let's do this the final version
 

457
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,910
and then let's do this the final version
back two okay

458
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:25,920

 

459
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,990

divide five back two

460
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:30,000
divide five back two
 

461
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,030
divide five back two
so left right equals one

462
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:33,040
so left right equals one
 

463
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,030
so left right equals one
and then the the the upper bound is ten

464
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:37,040
and then the the the upper bound is ten
 

465
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,470
and then the the the upper bound is ten
right because there are ten elements in

466
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:38,480
right because there are ten elements in
 

467
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:38,870
right because there are ten elements in
there

468
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:38,880
there
 

469
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,190
there
yeah two four six and ten when you think

470
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:43,200
yeah two four six and ten when you think
 

471
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,450
yeah two four six and ten when you think
bad

472
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:44,460

yeah if check mid
is one so where is the answer

484
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:08,639

 

485

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,069
yeah so do you see it this is the
program right

514
00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:14,079
program right
 

515
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,949
program right
what's the complexity of the second

00:14:16,949 --> 00:14:16,959
what's the complexity of the second
 

517
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:17,990
what's the complexity of the second

eight elements we needed three times to
search it because

568
00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:19,519
search it because
 

569
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,030
search it because
eight divided by two is four four

570
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,040
eight divided by two is four four

remember the power function power
 

577
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,150
remember the power function power
function is the same complexity as the

needs to times it
 

589
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,389
needs to times it
four or five times remember

usually it's in o

598

00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:02,560
log n come on how high is it look do you
 

601
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,150
log n come on how high is it look do you
understand now

602
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:04,160
understand now
 

603
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:18,150
understand now
yeah don't make a guess don't make

604
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:18,160

 

605
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,230

okay good job today turn on the lights

606
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:20,240
okay good job today turn on the lights
 

607
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,839
okay good job today turn on the lights
and then you can do a little bit dancing
