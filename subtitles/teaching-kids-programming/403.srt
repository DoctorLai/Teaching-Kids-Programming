1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:06,560
follow me sorry mr ryan all right yes so

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:10,080
you learn about a fraction yeah

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:12,800
which one is that numerator

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,800
numerators

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,920
numerator yeah yeah you made it very

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,920
high the denominator is very low

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,000
the denominator is already out of the

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,000
game

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,800
down the top

10
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,689
[Music]

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,280
okay okay

12
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,840
okay so what's the simplified fraction

13
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,879
for example is this is this a simplified

14
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,640
fraction

15
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,960
yeah okay

16
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,079
is this a simplified

17
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,239
fraction

18
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,239
no

19
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:08,240
okay so how do we check if the fraction

20
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,960
is simplified like b

21
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:14,320
a over a so

22
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,799
if any of them is a prime number

23
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,360
it's a prime number

24
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,000
not really it's what do you say any

25
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:25,040
number is the prime number

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,280
b or a is a prime number that is a

27
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,360
supervised fraction

28
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,640
i give you example like point number

29
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,479
five yeah

30
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,560
okay so how about ten

31
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,000
five this is a prime number but this is

32
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,400
not simplified

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,400
yeah if the denominator is a prime

34
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,400
number

35
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,000
something to do with the plan

36
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,439
so what

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,520
what's the simplified what's not

38
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:03,759
simplified so look forward to my uh

39
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,000
no no no no no

40
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,879
look what p over a

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,720
yeah so if we can divide by something

42
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:14,800
that's a mixed fraction

43
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:18,080
yeah okay so look if b is divisible by c

44
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,800
a is divided by c and c is not equal to

45
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,879
one

46
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,599
c is an integer but not

47
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,640
is it not equals to one

48
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,640
so

49
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,120
then let's uh

50
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,560
then that's that's one

51
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,720
that's not a

52
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,959
simplified fraction right so in other

53
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,560
words we want to find out that

54
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,440
if b and a

55
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,160
are cosine we call it

56
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,120
if they can divided by the same number

57
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,040
yeah

58
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,879
if they come divided by the same number

59
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,840
we call it cobra

60
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:53,200
like three and five that's two times

61
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,200
because they're they're only projects

62
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,440
yeah yeah yeah oh yeah

63
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,920
not quite not quite the same look

64
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,920
compromise

65
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,519
girlfriend

66
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,680
so three and five the only positive

67
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:11,200
number can be divisible by them is one

68
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,519
right so we call it program three prime

69
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:17,920
is essentially the same as gcd what's

70
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:19,519
gcd greatest common divisor so kopran of

71
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,599
look a and b

72
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:25,920
are compliant if gcd of them is one okay

73
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,680
is that clear if a and b are co-prime

74
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,920
then it's a simplified version a

75
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,840
fraction okay let's say

76
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,799
three

77
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:37,680
over eighteen is a simple five fraction

78
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:40,000
why is that because the same number six

79
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,959
yes because the three and eighteen the

80
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,879
gcd is three yeah okay

81
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:49,440
yeah yeah as long as it's not equal to

82
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:50,640
one then it's not a simplified

83
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,280
fraction okay

84
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,519
so today's task is easy so we are given

85
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,799
an integer n

86
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,400
integer n

87
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,120
we want to find out

88
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,760
the

89
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,439
the the fractions the simplified

90
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,519
fractions

91
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:08,560
between zero and one

92
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:11,680
okay not e bigger than zero

93
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,040
less than one okay this one you see open

94
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,360
parenthesis

95
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,840
open parenthesis means excluding right

96
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,400
it's good

97
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,800
square bracket means equal right so if

98
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,520
this is zero one square bracket it means

99
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,440
that x bigger than zero equal to zero

100
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,759
smaller or equal to one okay so but we

101
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,880
are talking about these cases which is

102
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,479
between

103
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,840
zero and one

104
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,120
okay

105
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,040
but

106
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,360
not equal to zero and not equal to one

107
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,280
okay so we want to find out we're given

108
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,320
a number and we want to find out that

109
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:48,080
the the denominator a the simplified

110
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:50,160
fraction e over a where a is smaller or

111
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,160
equal than n right

112
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,680
and then we find out the number of

113
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,720
we want to find out the number of the

114
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,919
simple simpler fraction yeah yeah so we

115
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,080
can just

116
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,120
so we can just repeat how how do we do

117
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,720
it look

118
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:08,000
so look we given this integer n right so

119
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:10,960
we can bring forth the a right

120
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,840
prove us from one to a from uh from one

121
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,240
to n

122
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,120
and then we can prove of b

123
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,080
from one to a all right

124
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,800
yeah

125
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,960
so

126
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,320
gcd do we still remember how do we get a

127
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:27,919
gcd

128
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,919
like 27 and 18 what's the gcd on both

129
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:36,400
yeah yeah wow that was quick

130
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:42,000
how how do we get the knife

131
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:43,680
remember this divide 8 27 18 we divided

132
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,320
by 18

133
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,840
and remaining

134
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,240
nine yeah

135
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,240
all right

136
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,440
so it's we just swap here so that will

137
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,759
be 18

138
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,639
18 divided by nine

139
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,080
so by zero once we get the zero

140
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,680
this is the

141
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,520
this is the

142
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,430
greatest common device okay let's try

143
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:11,120
some example okay some more example

144
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:14,080
[Music]

145
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,080
45

146
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:21,039
maybe 24 and 36. eight

147
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,039
what's the

148
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,080
so how do we do it

149
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,000
24

150
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,240
divided by 36

151
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,479
the remainder is 24 right

152
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,360
so we move it here we move here so it

153
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,520
becomes

154
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,560
36 24.

155
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:55,039
36 divided by 24 remaining

156
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,039
12.

157
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,199
we just move move b

158
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,560
yeah yeah

159
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:09,120
24 divided by 12. three poisons

160
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,120
okay i'm poisoned okay 24 divided by 12.

161
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,440
zero so look

162
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,880
you see so

163
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,720
so we this is the way we get a greatest

164
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,280
common divisor okay

165
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,840
so actually the in python we don't need

166
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:27,520
to implement this in in the math library

167
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:30,800
we have these we have uh

168
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,639
we have this math.gcd we already have

169
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,680
this we don't need to be rather weird

170
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:38,960
yeah but if you really want to

171
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,960
implement it define gtd

172
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,759
a b

173
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,840
okay

174
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,319
so

175
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,599
wire y p is greater than zero then we

176
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,400
can do

177
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:53,120
a b equals b

178
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,319
a divided by b remaining okay and then

179
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,039
we turn

180
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,479
return a right okay let's the greatest

181
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,560
common device that we talked about a

182
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,840
long time ago

183
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,000
yeah

184
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:07,360
okay

185
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,080
y b is bigger than zero a b a

186
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,960
b will become the a

187
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:15,039
and then b will be become a divided by b

188
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,599
the remainder okay

189
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:19,520
okay and then we can also implement this

190
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,120
using the recursion right like i said

191
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,039
okay that's not a

192
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,240
that's not a topic from today today

193
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,599
we're going to

194
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,520
talk about what

195
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,919
finding the number of the simplified

196
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,640
fractions when the denominator

197
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:34,560
is less than equal to n right so we can

198
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,320
just come from here we can prove over

199
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,000
here

200
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,360
prime

201
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,440
okay so one question what is coconut two

202
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,560
numbers a and b are coupons a prime

203
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,800
number

204
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,200
what's cobra can you give me an example

205
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,360
a and b i think

206
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,080
okay so what okay so as we know the

207
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,640
numbers they are not those prime numbers

208
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,480
co-prime

209
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,519
coupon look

210
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,560
one

211
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,560
of one and three

212
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,440
one is no prime number

213
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,200
okay so

214
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,680
what's cooper what did i just say what's

215
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,680
girlfriend

216
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:17,440
is 4 and 12 cobra

217
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,440
9

218
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,880
no right

219
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,360
okay is

220
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:26,320
3 and

221
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,959
nine cobra yeah

222
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,480
yeah um yeah

223
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,160
no

224
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,920
so what's coconut i just said i was just

225
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:37,230
saying like

226
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:42,710
it could be divided

227
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:42,710
[Music]

228
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,959
yeah so we can simplify so what are we

229
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,760
looking for if we can find out if the

230
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:53,040
gcd these two number is

231
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:55,440
is what number then is the code

232
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,959
if it's

233
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,959
simplified

234
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:01,040
the greatest common divisor of two

235
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,760
number if there are there are two prime

236
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,120
if

237
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,519
if the

238
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,360
greatest common divisor is what number i

239
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,079
was just talking if we can't find

240
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,839
anything i learned what number

241
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,760
one yeah that's what i'm saying if it's

242
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,079
the greatest common divisor

243
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:19,839
or first number is one

244
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,839
then it's cochrane okay

245
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,480
okay

246
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,480
okay now we can implement the first

247
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,200
thing okay

248
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,399
define okay let's say if i simplify

249
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,040
simplify

250
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,640
parallelize simplify fraction okay

251
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,399
simplify fraction

252
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:42,399
we give it an n right

253
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,440
so let's put an answer in the uh

254
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,040
in

255
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,920
in the list okay answer equals zero for

256
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,200
i

257
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,200
in range

258
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,279
n okay

259
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,760
let's say

260
00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:00,880
we iterate with the denominator for

261
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:03,040
denominator in range n star from one

262
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,360
okay because the denominator can be zero

263
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:09,440
all right yeah

264
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,440
what happens if the denominator is zero

265
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,959
what's one divided by zero

266
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,959
you can't divide by zero

267
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,959
that's not the thing yeah denominator

268
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,839
number yeah

269
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,800
okay

270
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,640
e1 to n plus one okay and then

271
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:29,279
for the not

272
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:33,200
denominator yeah nominator in range

273
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:36,240
up to one over

274
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,040
up to t right up to d

275
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,240
yeah

276
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,440
and then if the gcd

277
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,920
and d

278
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,480
equal equals one right

279
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,440
then we can implement this answer easy

280
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,200
yeah

281
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,320
return

282
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,800
answer okay okay yeah

283
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:58,160
no b look a little bit

284
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:00,560
yeah all right right

285
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:04,800
the time complexity look d

286
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,800
iterates from one to n right n

287
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:09,920
uh okay uh we have a duplicate variable

288
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:12,480
name here let's say denominator

289
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,720
numerator numerator

290
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,720
okay

291
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,680
so the term convexity is o n squared

292
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,839
times

293
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:26,800
look this is o n o n

294
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,800
by the gcp the term convexity of gcd

295
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,880
gg ib yeah

296
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,760
the temperature is locked

297
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:36,560
upper bound will be the minimum

298
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,399
of a and b okay

299
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:42,560
so you'll be all

300
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:44,880
o n square log mean a times b okay

301
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,360
let's see overall time complexity for

302
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,120
this argument

303
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,760
any questions

304
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,760
any questions

305
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,200
now so can you explain to me what's b

306
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,560
speed

307
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,560
what's this for d in range 1 to n what

308
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,600
are we doing here

309
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,320
we

310
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,560
denominator

311
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,120
we pull something the technology yeah i

312
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,120
know what's this

313
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,079
we put in the numerator and what's this

314
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,399
um

315
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:18,079
what's it what does it mean

316
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:21,079
what are we checking why are we taking

317
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,079
this

318
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,160
ryan

319
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:41,760
ryan come on you're on the pokemon town

320
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,959
so you need to please me okay so

321
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,519
what's this

322
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,519
it's full

323
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:50,480
we are

324
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:53,680
that the numerator this bit

325
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:56,959
look 4 is the proof of it's a for loop

326
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:59,360
yeah d from 1 to n and the numerator

327
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:01,360
goes from 1 to the

328
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,600
to the maximum denominator and then the

329
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,720
greatest common divisor if it's one

330
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,760
normally and

331
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,000
uh

332
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,079
if the numerator and the

333
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,240
numerator the greatest common divisor is

334
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:14,480
one it means it's a simplified fraction

335
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,839
right now we increment the answer yeah

336
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,839
yeah okay

337
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,839
okay

338
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,360
okay

339
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,199
yeah

340
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,240
okay so

341
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,920
uh

342
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,639
okay one more question okay one more

343
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:34,079
tricky question okay

344
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,320
let's say

345
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,320
uh

346
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,680
72

347
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:46,079
