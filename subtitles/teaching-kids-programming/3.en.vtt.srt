1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,750

fine okay so today

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:03,760
fine okay so today
 

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,430
fine okay so today
we'll talk about the fibonacci number

4
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:05,440
we'll talk about the fibonacci number
 

5
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,590
we'll talk about the fibonacci number
okay fibonacci number

6
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:07,600
okay fibonacci number
 

7
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,070
okay fibonacci number
so the fibonacci number is a sequence

8
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:12,080
so the fibonacci number is a sequence
 

9
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,310
so the fibonacci number is a sequence
number sequence the first number is one

10
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:14,320
number sequence the first number is one
 

11
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,910
number sequence the first number is one
the second number is

12
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:15,920
the second number is
 

13
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,349
the second number is
the first number is zero second number

14
00:00:17,349 --> 00:00:17,359
the first number is zero second number
 

15
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,150
the first number is zero second number
is one and the next numbers is always

16
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:20,160
is one and the next numbers is always
 

17
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,390
is one and the next numbers is always
equal to the previous two right yeah

18
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:22,400
equal to the previous two right yeah
 

19
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,470
equal to the previous two right yeah
so that's one two three five

20
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:26,480
so that's one two three five
 

21
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,029
so that's one two three five
eight thirteen and that's it okay got it

22
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:31,039
eight thirteen and that's it okay got it
 

23
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,910
eight thirteen and that's it okay got it
yeah so if we put it in a mathematic

24
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:33,920
yeah so if we put it in a mathematic
 

25
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,190
yeah so if we put it in a mathematic
equation we can say

26
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:35,200
equation we can say
 

27
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,470
equation we can say
f function let's say f n

28
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:38,480
f function let's say f n
 

29
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,990
f function let's say f n
equals f n

30
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:42,000
equals f n
 

31
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,990
equals f n
minus 1 plus f by n minus 2 i'm right

32
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:46,000
minus 1 plus f by n minus 2 i'm right
 

33
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,350
minus 1 plus f by n minus 2 i'm right
am right yeah because this f n

34
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:49,360
am right yeah because this f n
 

35
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,189
am right yeah because this f n
if n is here yeah then n minus 1 is here

36
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:53,199
if n is here yeah then n minus 1 is here
 

37
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,470
if n is here yeah then n minus 1 is here
and n minus 2 is here so f

38
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:56,480
and n minus 2 is here so f
 

39
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,910
and n minus 2 is here so f
n equals f of n minus 1

40
00:00:59,910 --> 00:00:59,920
n equals f of n minus 1
 

41
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,110
n equals f of n minus 1
plus m of n minus 2 yeah but we need to

42
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:03,120
plus m of n minus 2 yeah but we need to
 

43
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,590
plus m of n minus 2 yeah but we need to
also define the first two cases f 0

44
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:05,600
also define the first two cases f 0
 

45
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,030
also define the first two cases f 0
is 0 f 1 is what

46
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:09,040
is 0 f 1 is what
 

47
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,030
is 0 f 1 is what
okay yeah yeah so how can we implement

48
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:13,040
okay yeah yeah so how can we implement
 

49
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:13,350
okay yeah yeah so how can we implement
it

50
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:13,360
it
 

51
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,030
it
using computer

52
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:17,040

 

53
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,510

def f means f means fibonacci numbers

54
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:21,520
def f means f means fibonacci numbers
 

55
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,310
def f means f means fibonacci numbers
yes yes or f we just use f for sure okay

56
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:24,320
yes yes or f we just use f for sure okay
 

57
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,350
yes yes or f we just use f for sure okay
for quicker

58
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:25,360
for quicker
 

59
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,550
for quicker
then and but you need brackets

60
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:28,560
then and but you need brackets
 

61
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,910
then and but you need brackets
okay yeah they need to work for

62
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:31,920
okay yeah they need to work for
 

63
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,710
okay yeah they need to work for
all of them okay so look look it's

64
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:34,720
all of them okay so look look it's
 

65
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,670
all of them okay so look look it's
actually very

66
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:35,680
actually very
 

67
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,149
actually very
very easy because look we have defined

68
00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:38,159
very easy because look we have defined
 

69
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,510
very easy because look we have defined
those cases yeah

70
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:39,520
those cases yeah
 

71
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,590
those cases yeah
so we just have to do this if n equals

72
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:43,600
so we just have to do this if n equals
 

73
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,230
so we just have to do this if n equals
zero yeah then what should we determine

74
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:48,240
zero yeah then what should we determine
 

75
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,109
zero yeah then what should we determine
f equals zero if n equals zero what

76
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:51,119
f equals zero if n equals zero what
 

77
00:01:51,119 --> 00:02:05,350
f equals zero if n equals zero what
should we determine

78
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:05,360

 

79
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,150

return one yeah

80
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:10,160
return one yeah
 

81
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,550
return one yeah
this return when when the computer

82
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:12,560
this return when when the computer
 

83
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,470
this return when when the computer
executes return you will return this

84
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:14,480
executes return you will return this
 

85
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,390
executes return you will return this
value immediately without going further

86
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:16,400
value immediately without going further
 

87
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,110
value immediately without going further
right

88
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:17,120
right
 

89
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,710
right
yeah then else will return what

90
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:22,720
yeah then else will return what
 

91
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,750
yeah then else will return what
f n minus one plus f

92
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:25,760
f n minus one plus f
 

93
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,390
f n minus one plus f
and minus two okay this is f is the

94
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:28,400
and minus two okay this is f is the
 

95
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,229
and minus two okay this is f is the
function we know okay because

96
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:30,239
function we know okay because
 

97
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,470
function we know okay because
okay we talked about recursion yesterday

98
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:32,480
okay we talked about recursion yesterday
 

99
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,830
okay we talked about recursion yesterday
yeah

100
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:34,840
yeah
 

101
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,869
yeah
okay

102
00:02:36,869 --> 00:02:36,879
okay
 

103
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,589
okay
so it's pretty similar to what have we

104
00:02:39,589 --> 00:02:39,599
so it's pretty similar to what have we
 

105
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,949
so it's pretty similar to what have we
we have defined in

106
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:40,959
we have defined in
 

107
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,030
we have defined in
math right yeah okay so

108
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,040
math right yeah okay so
 

109
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,110
math right yeah okay so
we let's let's let's do this

110
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:49,120
we let's let's let's do this
 

111
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,309
we let's let's let's do this
look that's only okay let's let's

112
00:02:52,309 --> 00:02:52,319
look that's only okay let's let's
 

113
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,070
look that's only okay let's let's
for example f5 we want to calculate f5

114
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:56,080
for example f5 we want to calculate f5
 

115
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,149
for example f5 we want to calculate f5
so what values do we need to calculate

116
00:02:58,149 --> 00:02:58,159
so what values do we need to calculate
 

117
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,589
so what values do we need to calculate
in order to get the value of

118
00:02:59,589 --> 00:02:59,599
in order to get the value of
 

119
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,430
in order to get the value of
f5

120
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:03,440

 

121
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,110

so we will do zero one one

122
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:07,120
so we will do zero one one
 

123
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,670
so we will do zero one one
two three no no what i mean is here from

124
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:09,680
two three no no what i mean is here from
 

125
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,070
two three no no what i mean is here from
here f5

126
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:12,080
here f5
 

127
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,030
here f5
what do we need to calculate in order no

128
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:15,040
what do we need to calculate in order no
 

129
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,589
what do we need to calculate in order no
before we calculate the f5

130
00:03:19,589 --> 00:03:19,599
before we calculate the f5
 

131
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,110
before we calculate the f5
what do we need to know before we

132
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:21,120
what do we need to know before we
 

133
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,710
what do we need to know before we
calculate f5

134
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:22,720
calculate f5
 

135
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,910
calculate f5
this is f4 right this is

136
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:25,920
this is f4 right this is
 

137
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:31,270
this is f4 right this is
f3 yeah yeah

138
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:31,280

 

139
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,949

so what do we need to know before we

140
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:32,959
so what do we need to know before we
 

141
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:42,789
so what do we need to know before we
calculate f4

142
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:42,799

 

143
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,030

f3 and f2 right

144
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:47,040
f3 and f2 right
 

145
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,710
f3 and f2 right
yeah what what do we need to know before

146
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:50,720
yeah what what do we need to know before
 

147
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,710
yeah what what do we need to know before
we calculate f3

148
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:52,720
we calculate f3
 

149
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:59,350
we calculate f3
can you tell me

150
00:03:59,350 --> 00:03:59,360

 

151
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,149

what's the previous two items of f3

152
00:04:04,149 --> 00:04:04,159
what's the previous two items of f3
 

153
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,789
what's the previous two items of f3
f2 and f1 right

154
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:08,799
f2 and f1 right
 

155
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,830
f2 and f1 right
yes okay so do you find the problem here

156
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:13,840
yes okay so do you find the problem here
 

157
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,349
yes okay so do you find the problem here
you find the problem here f3 we

158
00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:17,359
you find the problem here f3 we
 

159
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:19,110
you find the problem here f3 we
calculate

160
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:19,120
calculate
 

161
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,590
calculate
twice all right f2

162
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:23,600
twice all right f2
 

163
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,390
twice all right f2
yeah twice now if you're going to this

164
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:26,400
yeah twice now if you're going to this
 

165
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,030
yeah twice now if you're going to this
way

166
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:27,040
way
 

167
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,230
way
there will be f2 and f1

168
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:30,240
there will be f2 and f1
 

169
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,030
there will be f2 and f1
okay so f2 is calculated multiple times

170
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,040
okay so f2 is calculated multiple times
 

171
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,749
okay so f2 is calculated multiple times
as well

172
00:04:33,749 --> 00:04:33,759
as well
 

173
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,790
as well
yeah so so

174
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:36,800
yeah so so
 

175
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,189
yeah so so
is there a way to avoid calculating

176
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:39,199
is there a way to avoid calculating
 

177
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,870
is there a way to avoid calculating
again again

178
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:40,880
again again
 

179
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,710
again again
yeah so we use uh something called uh

180
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:46,720

 

181
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,830

we can save this value right we can save

182
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:49,840
we can save this value right we can save
 

183
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,070
we can save this value right we can save
save this value or put it down on a

184
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,080
save this value or put it down on a
 

185
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,950
save this value or put it down on a
notebook

186
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:52,960
notebook
 

187
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,550
notebook
yeah yeah so how can we do this

188
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:56,560
yeah yeah so how can we do this
 

189
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,830
yeah yeah so how can we do this
so we first first first if this key

190
00:04:59,830 --> 00:04:59,840
so we first first first if this key
 

191
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,749
so we first first first if this key
this value is not calculated we

192
00:05:01,749 --> 00:05:01,759
this value is not calculated we
 

193
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,270
this value is not calculated we
calculate it

194
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:03,280
calculate it
 

195
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,390
calculate it
and then we once we have the value we

196
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:06,400
and then we once we have the value we
 

197
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,670
and then we once we have the value we
put it in somewhere in the

198
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:07,680
put it in somewhere in the
 

199
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,629
put it in somewhere in the
notebook yeah so later when we find this

200
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:10,639
notebook yeah so later when we find this
 

201
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,350
notebook yeah so later when we find this
value

202
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:11,360
value
 

203
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,870
value
we order this value instead of

204
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:12,880
we order this value instead of
 

205
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,390
we order this value instead of
calculating it again

206
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:14,400
calculating it again
 

207
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,590
calculating it again
we get a value from the notebook yeah

208
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:17,600
we get a value from the notebook yeah
 

209
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,430
we get a value from the notebook yeah
okay yeah notebook look and stand for

210
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:21,440
okay yeah notebook look and stand for
 

211
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,390
okay yeah notebook look and stand for
notebook

212
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:22,400
notebook
 

213
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,029
notebook
no no n is the value we want to

214
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:25,039
no no n is the value we want to
 

215
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:25,749
no no n is the value we want to
calculate

216
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:25,759
calculate
 

217
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,870
calculate
so we let's modify a little bit f

218
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:28,880
so we let's modify a little bit f
 

219
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,469
so we let's modify a little bit f
f f n okay and let's

220
00:05:32,469 --> 00:05:32,479
f f n okay and let's
 

221
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,070
f f n okay and let's
use it as m b stands for notebook okay

222
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,080
use it as m b stands for notebook okay
 

223
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,350
use it as m b stands for notebook okay
okay yeah okay so what do we do here

224
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:39,360
okay yeah okay so what do we do here
 

225
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,029
okay yeah okay so what do we do here
so let's first check up these okay so

226
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:43,039
so let's first check up these okay so
 

227
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,350
so let's first check up these okay so
the notebook okay the notebook notebook

228
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:45,360
the notebook okay the notebook notebook
 

229
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,950
the notebook okay the notebook notebook
is a dictionary object

230
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:46,960
is a dictionary object
 

231
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,189
is a dictionary object
in python you use this curly brace

232
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:49,199
in python you use this curly brace
 

233
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,310
in python you use this curly brace
dictionary

234
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:50,320
dictionary
 

235
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,590
dictionary
curly brace to store the key value pairs

236
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:53,600
curly brace to store the key value pairs
 

237
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,590
curly brace to store the key value pairs
key value pairs

238
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:57,600

 

239
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,830

curly brace okay we can work on that

240
00:05:59,830 --> 00:05:59,840
curly brace okay we can work on that
 

241
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,189
curly brace okay we can work on that
later okay

242
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:01,199
later okay
 

243
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,629
later okay
so so you can initialize is a curly

244
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:04,639
so so you can initialize is a curly
 

245
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,710
so so you can initialize is a curly
brace object

246
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:06,720
brace object
 

247
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,670
brace object
so now we have a notebook yeah so let's

248
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:09,680
so now we have a notebook yeah so let's
 

249
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,070
so now we have a notebook yeah so let's
see

250
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,080
see
 

251
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,189
see
if this value if this value

252
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:13,199
if this value if this value
 

253
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,749
if this value if this value
n is already in the notebook

254
00:06:17,749 --> 00:06:17,759
n is already in the notebook
 

255
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,230
n is already in the notebook
right so then now what do we do we

256
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:20,240
right so then now what do we do we
 

257
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,270
right so then now what do we do we
return

258
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:21,280
return
 

259
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,590
return
we immediately return look it up in the

260
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:23,600
we immediately return look it up in the
 

261
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,029
we immediately return look it up in the
notebook notebook

262
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:25,039
notebook notebook
 

263
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,870
notebook notebook
with the value end right okay

264
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:28,880
with the value end right okay
 

265
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,710
with the value end right okay
then we can ask yes this is the

266
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:32,720
then we can ask yes this is the
 

267
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,629
then we can ask yes this is the
the base case if n equals zero

268
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:36,639
the base case if n equals zero
 

269
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,909
the base case if n equals zero
return zero

270
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:39,919
return zero
 

271
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:44,629
return zero
if n equals one return

272
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:44,639
if n equals one return
 

273
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,950
if n equals one return
one okay now this is the interesting

274
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:46,960
one okay now this is the interesting
 

275
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,309
one okay now this is the interesting
part now we don't want to know the

276
00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:48,319
part now we don't want to know the
 

277
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,029
part now we don't want to know the
answer yeah

278
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:49,039
answer yeah
 

279
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,230
answer yeah
answer equals fn

280
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:52,240
answer equals fn
 

281
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,350
answer equals fn
minus one notebook

282
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:55,360
minus one notebook
 

283
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,950
minus one notebook
plus fn minus two notebook okay

284
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:58,960
plus fn minus two notebook okay
 

285
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,350
plus fn minus two notebook okay
plus this notebook objects around and

286
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:01,360
plus this notebook objects around and
 

287
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,150
plus this notebook objects around and
then now we know this answer yeah

288
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:04,160
then now we know this answer yeah
 

289
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,550
then now we know this answer yeah
now we want to save it on the on in the

290
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:06,560
now we want to save it on the on in the
 

291
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,710
now we want to save it on the on in the
notebook yeah put it on a notebook

292
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:08,720
notebook yeah put it on a notebook
 

293
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,830
notebook yeah put it on a notebook
so let's say notebook and yeah

294
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:11,840
so let's say notebook and yeah
 

295
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,270
so let's say notebook and yeah
because we are calculating the n equals

296
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:15,280
because we are calculating the n equals
 

297
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:20,230
because we are calculating the n equals
answer now then let's return the answer

298
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:20,240
answer now then let's return the answer
 

299
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,830
answer now then let's return the answer
okay does it make sense

300
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:23,840
okay does it make sense
 

301
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,670
okay does it make sense
does it make sense look the difference

302
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:27,680
does it make sense look the difference
 

303
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,309
does it make sense look the difference
here this is the one difference look it

304
00:07:30,309 --> 00:07:30,319
here this is the one difference look it
 

305
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,670
here this is the one difference look it
up

306
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:31,680
up
 

307
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,629
up
another difference here to save it to

308
00:07:34,629 --> 00:07:34,639
another difference here to save it to
 

309
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,189
another difference here to save it to
put it down in the notebook yeah

310
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:37,199
put it down in the notebook yeah
 

311
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,309
put it down in the notebook yeah
and this is the notebook object so

312
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:40,319
and this is the notebook object so
 

313
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,710
and this is the notebook object so
you can say notebook notebook equals

314
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:42,720
you can say notebook notebook equals
 

315
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,670
you can say notebook notebook equals
these objects

316
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:43,680
these objects
 

317
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,550
these objects
and then you can say notebook like three

318
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:46,560
and then you can say notebook like three
 

319
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,830
and then you can say notebook like three
equals

320
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:47,840
equals
 

321
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,990
equals
one one one one two so that's three is

322
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:52,000
one one one one two so that's three is
 

323
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,390
one one one one two so that's three is
two

324
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:52,400
two
 

325
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,390
two
right so we can say three in

326
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:56,400
right so we can say three in
 

327
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,309
right so we can say three in
notebook these will return true right

328
00:08:00,309 --> 00:08:00,319
notebook these will return true right
 

329
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,430
notebook these will return true right
like if four in notebook

330
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:03,440
like if four in notebook
 

331
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,110
like if four in notebook
now we don't know yet let me return

332
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:05,120
now we don't know yet let me return
 

333
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,869
now we don't know yet let me return
fourth do you get it

334
00:08:06,869 --> 00:08:06,879
fourth do you get it
 

335
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,909
fourth do you get it
do you get it yeah so

336
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:09,919
do you get it yeah so
 

337
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,469
do you get it yeah so
after using this notebook each value of

338
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:12,479
after using this notebook each value of
 

339
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,869
after using this notebook each value of
the fibonacci number we only categorize

340
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:14,879
the fibonacci number we only categorize
 

341
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:15,189
the fibonacci number we only categorize
right

342
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:15,199
right
 

343
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,350
right
because the first time we don't see in

344
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:17,360
because the first time we don't see in
 

345
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,230
because the first time we don't see in
the notebook

346
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:18,240
the notebook
 

347
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,029
the notebook
we calculate it but after we get a value

348
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:21,039
we calculate it but after we get a value
 

349
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,469
we calculate it but after we get a value
we immediately put it down in the

350
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:22,479
we immediately put it down in the
 

351
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:23,189
we immediately put it down in the
notebook

352
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:23,199
notebook
 

353
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,270
notebook
and next time we look it up so you're

354
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:25,280
and next time we look it up so you're
 

355
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,469
and next time we look it up so you're
only in the notebook so we don't

356
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:26,479
only in the notebook so we don't
 

357
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,150
only in the notebook so we don't
calculate it okay we'll just look it up

358
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:28,160
calculate it okay we'll just look it up
 

359
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,430
calculate it okay we'll just look it up
right

360
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:29,440
right
 

361
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,750
right
okay got it yeah and

362
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:33,760
okay got it yeah and
 

363
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,670
okay got it yeah and
so we talked about two implementations

364
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:35,680
so we talked about two implementations
 

365
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,509
so we talked about two implementations
yes the first one without the notebook

366
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:37,519
yes the first one without the notebook
 

367
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,670
yes the first one without the notebook
the second one is the notebook

368
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:39,680
the second one is the notebook
 

369
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,709
the second one is the notebook
and we can also have

370
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:42,719
and we can also have
 

371
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,670
and we can also have
one method which is probably simpler to

372
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:45,680
one method which is probably simpler to
 

373
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,150
one method which is probably simpler to
implement it's called iterative

374
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:48,160
implement it's called iterative
 

375
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,190
implement it's called iterative
so look define f

376
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:51,200
so look define f
 

377
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,590
so look define f
and f ryan

378
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:55,600
and f ryan
 

379
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,750
and f ryan
four okay so first two items

380
00:08:59,750 --> 00:08:59,760
four okay so first two items
 

381
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,550
four okay so first two items
a equals here let's define the current

382
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:02,560
a equals here let's define the current
 

383
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,750
a equals here let's define the current
two items in a

384
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:03,760
two items in a
 

385
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,310
two items in a
fibonacci number the first one is a the

386
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:06,320
fibonacci number the first one is a the
 

387
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,509
fibonacci number the first one is a the
second one is b

388
00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:07,519
second one is b
 

389
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,790
second one is b
right right is zero one okay

390
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:10,800
right right is zero one okay
 

391
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,430
right right is zero one okay
then we can we want the an integration

392
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:13,440
then we can we want the an integration
 

393
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,870
then we can we want the an integration
for i

394
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:14,880
for i
 

395
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,470
for i
in range

396
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:18,480
in range
 

397
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,750
in range
and so what do we do

398
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:21,760
and so what do we do
 

399
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,030
and so what do we do
a b equals

400
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:25,040
a b equals
 

401
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:30,230
a b equals
b a plus b and then we can return

402
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:30,240
b a plus b and then we can return
 

403
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,670
b a plus b and then we can return
return a okay so when you know what

404
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:33,680
return a okay so when you know what
 

405
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,750
return a okay so when you know what
necron for that is 55

406
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:35,760
necron for that is 55
 

407
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,430
necron for that is 55
yeah yeah yeah do you know what happened

408
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:37,440
yeah yeah yeah do you know what happened
 

409
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,430
yeah yeah yeah do you know what happened
here look

410
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:39,440
here look
 

411
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,790
here look
zero one zero one okay this is a this is

412
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:42,800
zero one zero one okay this is a this is
 

413
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,389
zero one zero one okay this is a this is
b

414
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:44,399
b
 

415
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,509
b
okay let's listen in the table okay

416
00:09:47,509 --> 00:09:47,519
okay let's listen in the table okay
 

417
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,790
okay let's listen in the table okay
okay zero one

418
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:50,800
okay zero one
 

419
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,389
okay zero one
so given an iteration the first one

420
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:54,399
so given an iteration the first one
 

421
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,949
so given an iteration the first one
a will become the value of b b will

422
00:09:56,949 --> 00:09:56,959
a will become the value of b b will
 

423
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,070
a will become the value of b b will
become the value of

424
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:58,080
become the value of
 

425
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,670
become the value of
a plus b okay a becomes the value of b

426
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:01,680
a plus b okay a becomes the value of b
 

427
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,790
a plus b okay a becomes the value of b
is one right b

428
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:04,800
is one right b
 

429
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,230
is one right b
becomes the value of a plus one is one

430
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:08,240
becomes the value of a plus one is one
 

431
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,350
becomes the value of a plus one is one
right a becomes the value of b

432
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:11,360
right a becomes the value of b
 

433
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,710
right a becomes the value of b
is one b becomes the value of a plus b

434
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:14,720
is one b becomes the value of a plus b
 

435
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,069
is one b becomes the value of a plus b
is two a become the value of

436
00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:18,079
is two a become the value of
 

437
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,509
is two a become the value of
b which is what 3

438
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:21,519
b which is what 3
 

439
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,069
b which is what 3
no no no a become the value of b which

440
00:10:24,069 --> 00:10:24,079
no no no a become the value of b which
 

441
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:25,269
no no no a become the value of b which
is 2

442
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:25,279
is 2
 

443
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,590
is 2
b become the value of a plus b which is

444
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:27,600
b become the value of a plus b which is
 

445
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,110
b become the value of a plus b which is
3.

446
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:29,120
3.
 

447
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,030
3.
so you see this is the fibonacci number

448
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:31,040
so you see this is the fibonacci number
 

449
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,790
so you see this is the fibonacci number
here yeah

450
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:32,800
here yeah
 

451
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,750
here yeah
yeah and the next item is a become the

452
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:35,760
yeah and the next item is a become the
 

453
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,430
yeah and the next item is a become the
value of b

454
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:37,440
value of b
 

455
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,710
value of b
three b becomes a value of a plus b

456
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:40,720
three b becomes a value of a plus b
 

457
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:49,110
three b becomes a value of a plus b
five you see one one one two three five

458
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:49,120

 

459
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,509

so we'll return this a is the fibonacci

460
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:51,519
so we'll return this a is the fibonacci
 

461
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,150
so we'll return this a is the fibonacci
number b

462
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:52,160
number b
 

463
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,990
number b
b is the next item yeah

464
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:56,000

 

465
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,550

the next one this is five this is a okay

466
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:58,560
the next one this is five this is a okay
 

467
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,590
the next one this is five this is a okay
got it

468
00:10:59,590 --> 00:10:59,600
got it
 

469
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,509
got it
okay so do you get it so which

470
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:03,519
okay so do you get it so which
 

471
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,590
okay so do you get it so which
all over those three methods which one

472
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:05,600
all over those three methods which one
 

473
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,550
all over those three methods which one
do you like best

474
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:08,560
do you like best
 

475
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,670
do you like best
which one do you like best what one this

476
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:11,680
which one do you like best what one this
 

477
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,630
which one do you like best what one this
is the one

478
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:12,640
is the one
 

479
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,110
is the one
implementation i remember the notebook

480
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:15,120
implementation i remember the notebook
 

481
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,750
implementation i remember the notebook
one

482
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:15,760
one
 

483
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,350
one
yeah remember the one without the

484
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:17,360
yeah remember the one without the
 

485
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,949
yeah remember the one without the
notebook because

486
00:11:18,949 --> 00:11:18,959
notebook because
 

487
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,829
notebook because
which one you like the best network

488
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:21,839
which one you like the best network
 

489
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:22,630
which one you like the best network
notebook one

490
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:22,640
notebook one
 

491
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,949
notebook one
and how good how about you input that in

492
00:11:24,949 --> 00:11:24,959
and how good how about you input that in
 

493
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:32,350
and how good how about you input that in
the computer with the notebook one

494
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:32,360

 

495
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,360

good
