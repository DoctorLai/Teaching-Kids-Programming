1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,629

do you still remember the pre-order

2
00:00:08,629 --> 00:00:08,639
do you still remember the pre-order
 

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,030
do you still remember the pre-order
yeah yeah what's the other we ordered

4
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:13,040
yeah yeah what's the other we ordered
 

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,709
yeah yeah what's the other we ordered
do not remember the binary two yeah

6
00:00:14,709 --> 00:00:14,719
do not remember the binary two yeah
 

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,550
do not remember the binary two yeah
pre-order what's pre-order

8
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:18,560

 

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,590

so it's like so what's the pre-order

10
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:21,600
so it's like so what's the pre-order
 

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,630
so it's like so what's the pre-order
very very nice so pre-order

12
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:24,640
very very nice so pre-order
 

13
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,710
very very nice so pre-order
pre-order remember pre-order uh note

14
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:28,720
pre-order remember pre-order uh note
 

15
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,349
pre-order remember pre-order uh note
left right yeah okay so what's the other

16
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:31,359
left right yeah okay so what's the other
 

17
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,110
left right yeah okay so what's the other
what what does the pre-order give for

18
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:33,120
what what does the pre-order give for
 

19
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:33,750
what what does the pre-order give for
this

20
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:33,760
this
 

21
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,510
this
binary tree it's

22
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:37,520
binary tree it's
 

23
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,549
binary tree it's
deficient i know i mean the order which

24
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:40,559
deficient i know i mean the order which
 

25
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:41,430
deficient i know i mean the order which
order is it

26
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:41,440
order is it
 

27
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,150
order is it
numbers one two

28
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:46,160

 

29
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,350

five three four okay

30
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:49,360
five three four okay
 

31
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,150
five three four okay
what's the preferred search order one

32
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:52,160
what's the preferred search order one
 

33
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:52,630
what's the preferred search order one
two

34
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:52,640
two
 

35
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,189
two
four five three okay so leave this level

36
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:55,199
four five three okay so leave this level
 

37
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,310
four five three okay so leave this level
value okay

38
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:56,320
value okay
 

39
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,389
value okay
okay so this is the primary how about if

40
00:00:58,389 --> 00:00:58,399
okay so this is the primary how about if
 

41
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,630
okay so this is the primary how about if
i tell you that today we're going to

42
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:00,640
i tell you that today we're going to
 

43
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,910
i tell you that today we're going to
do this pre-order in the end

44
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:03,920
do this pre-order in the end
 

45
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,070
do this pre-order in the end
and re okay how do you spell annual

46
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:06,080
and re okay how do you spell annual
 

47
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,830
and re okay how do you spell annual
retreat okay all right

48
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:07,840
retreat okay all right
 

49
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,350
retreat okay all right
all right so it doesn't happen

50
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:11,360
all right so it doesn't happen
 

51
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,990
all right so it doesn't happen
it means that it's more a parent can

52
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:14,000
it means that it's more a parent can
 

53
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,350
it means that it's more a parent can
have more than one kid

54
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:15,360
have more than one kid
 

55
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,789
have more than one kid
more than two kids so it will be

56
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:16,799
more than two kids so it will be
 

57
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,749
more than two kids so it will be
something like that six

58
00:01:19,749 --> 00:01:19,759
something like that six
 

59
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,830
something like that six
eight nine yeah yeah it could be

60
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:23,840
eight nine yeah yeah it could be
 

61
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,469
eight nine yeah yeah it could be
you know a lot right so what's the

62
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:26,479
you know a lot right so what's the
 

63
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:27,670

what's the
 

65
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,310
what's the
move let's see that's it what's the

00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:30,320
move let's see that's it what's the
 

67
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,109
move let's see that's it what's the
pre-order of this one

68
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:33,119
pre-order of this one
 

69
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,910
pre-order of this one
similarly yeah the note and then the

70
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:35,920
similarly yeah the note and then the
 

71
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:50,389
similarly yeah the note and then the
left from left to the right right

00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:04,799
eight we're down yeah basically yeah
 

81
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,150
eight we're down yeah basically yeah
basically and then the left to the right

82
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:08,160
basically and then the left to the right
 

83
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:08,790
basically and then the left to the right
yeah

84

yeah
 

85
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,070
yeah
okay and today okay so how can we define

86
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:12,080
okay and today okay so how can we define
 

87
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,990
okay and today okay so how can we define
c how can we define this energy tree

88
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:16,000
c how can we define this energy tree
 

89
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,790
c how can we define this energy tree
remember let's visit the primary tree

90
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:18,800
remember let's visit the primary tree
 

91
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,830
remember let's visit the primary tree
first okay how do you define a binary

92
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:20,840
first okay how do you define a binary
 

93
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,190
first okay how do you define a binary
tree

94
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:23,200
tree
 

95
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,710
tree
how do you define the balance define

96
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:26,720
how do you define the balance define
 

97
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,510
how do you define the balance define
how do you define the binary remember

98
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:29,520
how do you define the binary remember
 

99
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,350
how do you define the binary remember
the final thing is cash you have what

100
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:31,360
the final thing is cash you have what
 

101
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,670
the final thing is cash you have what
we should have a class class class

102
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:35,680
we should have a class class class
 

103
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,150
we should have a class class class
if it's a binary three note yeah

104
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:40,160

 

105
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,910

define int

106
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:43,920
define int
 

107
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,509
define int
init the constructor yeah with the value

108
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:47,519
init the constructor yeah with the value
 

109
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,630
init the constructor yeah with the value
and the left and the right right

110
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:50,640
and the left and the right right
 

111
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,350
and the left and the right right
let's just call it left and right okay

112
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:53,360
let's just call it left and right okay
 

113
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:53,750
let's just call it left and right okay
left

114
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:53,760
left
 

115
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,030
left
and right and then you can say self

116
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,040
and right and then you can say self
 

117
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,229
and right and then you can say self
dot value equals value

118
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:00,239
dot value equals value
 

119
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,550
dot value equals value
self dot left

120
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:04,560
self dot left
 

121
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,070
self dot left
left self top right

122
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:08,080
left self top right
 

123
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,030
left self top right
equals right right so this left and

124
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:11,040
equals right right so this left and
 

125
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,830
equals right right so this left and
right

126
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:11,840
right
 

127
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,949
right
is also node type right all right

128
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:14,959
is also node type right all right
 

129
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,270
is also node type right all right
this value could be landing number right

130
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:17,280
this value could be landing number right
 

131
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,710
this value could be landing number right
or the

132
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:18,720
or the
 

133
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,790
or the
anything right basically it's the value

134
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:22,800

 

135
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,470

all right this is a class yeah does it

136
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:24,480
all right this is a class yeah does it
 

137
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,990
all right this is a class yeah does it
make sense the left and right

138
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:26,000
make sense the left and right
 

139
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,869
make sense the left and right
points to excel right points to the type

140
00:03:28,869 --> 00:03:28,879
points to excel right points to the type
 

141
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:29,830
points to excel right points to the type
of itself

142
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:29,840
of itself
 

143
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,910
of itself
and how about we change this to another

144
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:31,920
and how about we change this to another
 

145
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,910
and how about we change this to another
retreat

146
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:33,920
retreat
 

147
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,110
retreat
another three so instead of having two

00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:37,120
another three so instead of having two
 

149
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,430
another three so instead of having two

approach which is let's not have a
 

315
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,469
approach which is let's not have a
basically question look

316
00:07:36,469 --> 00:07:36,479
basically question look
 

317
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,710
basically question look
all right eric where is the recursion

318
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:38,720
all right eric where is the recursion
 

319
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,830
all right eric where is the recursion
happening where is the

320
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:39,840
happening where is the
 

321
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,110
happening where is the
question no

322
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:43,120
question no
 

323
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,550
question no
point point to it more specifically yeah

324
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:46,560
point point to it more specifically yeah
 

325
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,550
point point to it more specifically yeah
where then can you point it to it

326
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:50,560
where then can you point it to it
 

327
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,270
where then can you point it to it
because you recursion why is the calling

328
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:53,280
because you recursion why is the calling
 

329
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,950
because you recursion why is the calling
itself

330
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:54,960
itself
 

331
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,189
itself
no your point where's the calling itself

332
00:07:57,189 --> 00:07:57,199
no your point where's the calling itself
 

333
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,710
no your point where's the calling itself
come on

334
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:58,720
come on
 

335
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,710
come on
don't wrap it up calling itself yes

336
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:02,720
don't wrap it up calling itself yes
 

337
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,790
don't wrap it up calling itself yes

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,710
yeah look this is the function name
right we're calling itself right

340
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:06,720
right we're calling itself right
 

341
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,150
right we're calling itself right
to deal with it but we don't want to

342
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:08,160
to deal with it but we don't want to
 

343
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,070
to deal with it but we don't want to
reach the question how can we do this

344
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,080
reach the question how can we do this
 

345
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,710
reach the question how can we do this
we remember location involves the stack

346
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:12,720
we remember location involves the stack
 

347
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,510
we remember location involves the stack
right

348
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:13,520
right
 

349
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,350
right
yeah and we can use the step to emulate

350
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:17,360
yeah and we can use the step to emulate
 

351
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,589
yeah and we can use the step to emulate
the location right does it make sense

352
00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:19,599
the location right does it make sense
 

353
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,270
the location right does it make sense
all right

354
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:21,280
all right
 

355
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,270
all right
okay look

356
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:25,280

 

357
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,309

now we have an answer first answer we

358
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:28,319
now we have an answer first answer we
 

359
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,270
now we have an answer first answer we
want to do this and then we have a stack

360
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:31,280
want to do this and then we have a stack
 

361
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,829
want to do this and then we have a stack
stack we we can use the list to do it

362
00:08:33,829 --> 00:08:33,839
stack we we can use the list to do it
 

363
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:34,630
stack we we can use the list to do it
right

364
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:34,640
right
 

365
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,750
right
yeah yeah the

366
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:37,760
yeah yeah the
 

367
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,909
yeah yeah the
stack and the beginning contain the loot

368
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:39,919
stack and the beginning contain the loot
 

369
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,509
stack and the beginning contain the loot
right okay

370
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:41,519
right okay
 

371
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,949
right okay
because we put a load in it right yeah

372
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:44,959
because we put a load in it right yeah
 

373
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,470
because we put a load in it right yeah
does that make sense why are

374
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:48,480
does that make sense why are
 

375
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,670
does that make sense why are
stack why there's anime in the stack i

376
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:51,680
stack why there's anime in the stack i
 

377
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,750
stack why there's anime in the stack i
will pop it out and current

378
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:55,760
will pop it out and current
 

379
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,990
will pop it out and current
will be stacked up how do we populate

380
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:00,000
will be stacked up how do we populate
 

381
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,269
will be stacked up how do we populate
element here right and then i need to

382
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:03,279
element here right and then i need to
 

383
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,590
element here right and then i need to
put it into the answer right answer plus

384
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:05,600
put it into the answer right answer plus
 

385
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,509
put it into the answer right answer plus
equal

386
00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:07,519
equal
 

387
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,790
equal
what current

388
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:10,800
what current
 

389
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,829
what current
dot value right now this is the

390
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:13,839
dot value right now this is the
 

391
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,030
dot value right now this is the
interesting bit

392
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,040
interesting bit
 

393
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,230
interesting bit

will be

470
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:04,560
will be
 

471
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,590
will be
two right all right if i put a

472
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:07,600
two right all right if i put a
 

473
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,990
two right all right if i put a
two three four in if i put a two three

474
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:10,000
two three four in if i put a two three
 

475
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,910
two three four in if i put a two three
four in this order the next one take out

476
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:11,920
four in this order the next one take out
 

477
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,269
four in this order the next one take out
would be four right

478
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:13,279
would be four right
 

479
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,949
would be four right
which i don't want i want to take off

480
00:11:14,949 --> 00:11:14,959
which i don't want i want to take off
 

481
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,269
which i don't want i want to take off
two so i need to push it two three

482
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:17,279
two so i need to push it two three
 

483
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,590
two so i need to push it two three
two three four in the reverse order so i

484
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:19,600
two three four in the reverse order so i
 

485
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,550
two three four in the reverse order so i
have one

486

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,550

in a reverse order how do you do this in

496
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:34,560
in a reverse order how do you do this in
 

497
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,990
in a reverse order how do you do this in
the reverse order

498
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:36,000
the reverse order
 

499
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:44,710
the reverse order
remember don't call it minus one

500
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:44,720

 

501
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,269

00:11:52,949 --> 00:11:52,959
great job yeah it's children color minus
 

507
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,790
great job yeah it's children color minus
one it's gonna be first order yeah

508
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:54,800
one it's gonna be first order yeah
 

509
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,790
one it's gonna be first order yeah
look it's children it's two three four

510
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:56,800
look it's children it's two three four
 

511
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,550
look it's children it's two three four
and in the reverse order watching

512
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:58,560
and in the reverse order watching
 

513
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,030
and in the reverse order watching
what's in the reverse order all right

514
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:01,040
what's in the reverse order all right
 

515
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,310
what's in the reverse order all right
all right

516
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:02,320
all right
 

517
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,470
all right
yeah what's in the reverse order is four

518
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:04,480
yeah what's in the reverse order is four
 

519
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,590
yeah what's in the reverse order is four
three two right yeah

520
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:05,600
three two right yeah
 

521
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,310
three two right yeah
and that's it so the next one look if i

522
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:08,320
and that's it so the next one look if i
 

523
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,230
and that's it so the next one look if i
put the four three two so the stack will

524
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:10,240
put the four three two so the stack will
 

525
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,110
put the four three two so the stack will
be look

526
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:11,120
be look
 

527
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,030
be look
four three two right

528
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:15,040
four three two right
 

529
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,670
four three two right
all right yeah so the next one where the

530
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:17,680
all right yeah so the next one where the
 

531
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,150
all right yeah so the next one where the
stack

532
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:18,160
stack
 

533
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,110
stack
and color is second pop what's common

534
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:21,120
and color is second pop what's common
 

535
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,590
and color is second pop what's common
color

536
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:21,600
color
 

537
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:29,350
color
will be what

538
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:29,360

 

539
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,910

yeah the two i take a two right and i

540
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:31,920
yeah the two i take a two right and i
 

541
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,910
yeah the two i take a two right and i
put a two here right answer plus equal

542
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:33,920
put a two here right answer plus equal
 

543
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,230
put a two here right answer plus equal
to

544
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:34,240
to
 

545
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,110
to
right and then it's kid kids i i put the

546
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:37,120
right and then it's kid kids i i put the
 

547
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,790
right and then it's kid kids i i put the
kids of two which is five

548
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:38,800
kids of two which is five
 

549
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,710
kids of two which is five
because only one element yeah i put it

550
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:40,720
because only one element yeah i put it
 

551
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,150
because only one element yeah i put it
five right

552
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:42,160
five right
 

553
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,870
five right
right and the next one which element to

554
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:44,880
right and the next one which element to
 

555
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,629
right and the next one which element to
take it

556
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:46,639
take it
 

557
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,910
take it
five five and there's no kids so i keep

558
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:49,920
five five and there's no kids so i keep
 

559
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,550
five five and there's no kids so i keep
pushing it so this doesn't have any kids

560
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:52,560
pushing it so this doesn't have any kids
 

561
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,710
pushing it so this doesn't have any kids
and then the next one is three right

562
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:54,720
and then the next one is three right
 

563
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,470
and then the next one is three right
and the next one is four yeah you see

564
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:56,480
and the next one is four yeah you see
 

565
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,389
and the next one is four yeah you see
one two five three four okay

566
00:12:58,389 --> 00:12:58,399
one two five three four okay
 

567
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,230
one two five three four okay
one two five three four doesn't make

568
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:00,240
one two five three four doesn't make
 

569
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,069
one two five three four doesn't make
sense look

570
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:02,079
sense look
 

571
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,110
sense look
all right look here here

572
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:05,120
all right look here here
 

573
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,150
all right look here here
these this is the same plus equal

574
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:08,160
these this is the same plus equal
 

575
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,790
these this is the same plus equal
this is the same as answer dot append

576
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:10,800
this is the same as answer dot append
 

577
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,470
this is the same as answer dot append
right let's put that one element at the

578
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:12,480
right let's put that one element at the
 

579
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,269
right let's put that one element at the
end right

580
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:13,279
end right
 

581
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,230
end right
this is the same right this is the same

582
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:16,240
this is the same right this is the same
 

583
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,350
this is the same right this is the same
as this

584
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:17,360
as this
 

585
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,470
as this
stack dot extent what stack of extent

586
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:20,480
stack dot extent what stack of extent
 

587
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,230
stack dot extent what stack of extent
is the same as stat

588
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:24,240
is the same as stat
 

589
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,110
is the same as stat
don't append all the elements in in

590
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:27,120
don't append all the elements in in
 

591
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,509
don't append all the elements in in
these

592
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:27,519
these
 

593
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,629
these
right right yes so look every area

594
00:13:30,629 --> 00:13:30,639
right right yes so look every area
 

595
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,590
right right yes so look every area
if yeah if the stack is book if stack

596
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:33,600
if yeah if the stack is book if stack
 

597
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:33,990
if yeah if the stack is book if stack
equals

598
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:34,000
equals
 

599
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,269
equals
one two three right and then and

600
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:37,279
one two three right and then and
 

601
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:41,350
one two three right and then and
eric equals four it was four

602
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:41,360
eric equals four it was four
 

603
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,430
eric equals four it was four
five four and then ryan

604
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:45,440
five four and then ryan
 

605
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,629
five four and then ryan
equals six and seven at least yeah so

606
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:48,639
equals six and seven at least yeah so
 

607
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,949
equals six and seven at least yeah so
i'm 13. listen up

608
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:52,959
i'm 13. listen up
 

609
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:57,030
i'm 13. listen up
i'm a teenager stack don't extend eric

610
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:57,040
i'm a teenager stack don't extend eric
 

611
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,629
i'm a teenager stack don't extend eric
so what happened after this

612
00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:00,639

 

613
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:14,829

step

614
00:14:14,829 --> 00:14:14,839

 

615
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,750

become stack will become one two

616
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:17,760
become stack will become one two
 

617
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,910
become stack will become one two
three and then what's eric four five and

618
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:19,920
three and then what's eric four five and
 

619
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,509
three and then what's eric four five and
you put a four and five right

620
00:14:21,509 --> 00:14:21,519
you put a four and five right
 

621
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,150
you put a four and five right
that's why you mean extend yeah extend

622
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:24,160
that's why you mean extend yeah extend
 

623
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,269
that's why you mean extend yeah extend
the step with

624
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:25,279
the step with
 

625
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,509
the step with
new elements right because they're at

626
00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:27,519
new elements right because they're at
 

627
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,030
new elements right because they're at
least all right

628
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:29,040
least all right
 

629
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,310
least all right
and extends doesn't have to be something

630
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:32,320
and extends doesn't have to be something
 

631
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,230
and extends doesn't have to be something
no no look you can do this class equal

632
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:36,240
no no look you can do this class equal
 

633
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,990
no no look you can do this class equal
if there's only only one element right

634
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:40,000
if there's only only one element right
 

635
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,069
if there's only only one element right
yeah you can do this way or you can do

636
00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:42,079
yeah you can do this way or you can do
 

637
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,069
yeah you can do this way or you can do
this stack

638
00:14:44,069 --> 00:14:44,079
this stack
 

639
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,829
this stack
plus equal current children

640
00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:47,839
plus equal current children
 

641
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,069
plus equal current children
that's what you mean children column

642
00:14:50,069 --> 00:14:50,079
that's what you mean children column
 

643
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:51,509
that's what you mean children column
color minus one yeah

644
00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:51,519
color minus one yeah
 

645
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,430
color minus one yeah
look that's what it means extend is the

646
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:53,440
look that's what it means extend is the
 

647
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,949
look that's what it means extend is the
same thing as this one right

648
00:14:54,949 --> 00:14:54,959
same thing as this one right
 

649
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,389
same thing as this one right
yeah you want to extend the reverse

650
00:14:58,389 --> 00:14:58,399
yeah you want to extend the reverse
 

651
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,030
yeah you want to extend the reverse
of the children into the list does it

652
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:01,040
of the children into the list does it
 

653
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,550
of the children into the list does it
make sense

654
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:02,560
make sense
 

655
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:07,670
make sense
yeah right okay so

656
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:07,680
yeah right okay so
 

657
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,069
yeah right okay so
so i mean this is the not recursion and

658
00:15:10,069 --> 00:15:10,079
so i mean this is the not recursion and
 

659
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,470
so i mean this is the not recursion and
this is the white loop eric while this

660
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:12,480
this is the white loop eric while this
 

661
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,629
this is the white loop eric while this
element in the stack i do this i pop one

662
00:15:14,629 --> 00:15:14,639
element in the stack i do this i pop one
 

663
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,629
element in the stack i do this i pop one
element from the stack i add

664
00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:16,639
element from the stack i add
 

665
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,189
element from the stack i add
append it to the answer and i extend its

666
00:15:19,189 --> 00:15:19,199
append it to the answer and i extend its
 

667
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,030
append it to the answer and i extend its
children in the reverse order why is it

668
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,040
children in the reverse order why is it
 

669
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,030
children in the reverse order why is it
in reverse order

670
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:23,040
in reverse order
 

671
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,350
in reverse order
because we want to do the

672
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:27,360

 

673
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,790

first thing that's all that's why we

674
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:28,800
first thing that's all that's why we
 

675
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,629
first thing that's all that's why we
need to reverse it right because the

676
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:30,639
need to reverse it right because the
 

677
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,310
need to reverse it right because the
stack is first in that cell

678
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:32,320
stack is first in that cell
 

679
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,389
stack is first in that cell
if you push two three four then four

680
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:34,399
if you push two three four then four
 

681
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,829
if you push two three four then four
will be taken out first

682
00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:35,839
will be taken out first
 

683
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,749
will be taken out first
if i push four three two and then two

684
00:15:37,749 --> 00:15:37,759
if i push four three two and then two
 

685
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,269
if i push four three two and then two
will be taken out first does it make

686
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:39,279
will be taken out first does it make
 

687
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,069
will be taken out first does it make
sense

688
00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:40,079
sense
 

689
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,629
sense
yeah does it make sense

690
00:15:44,629 --> 00:15:44,639

 

691
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,749

okay okay there there are a few

692
00:15:47,749 --> 00:15:47,759
okay okay there there are a few
 

693
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,150
okay okay there there are a few
two reasons they're gonna be united yeah

694
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:52,160
two reasons they're gonna be united yeah
 

695
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,310
two reasons they're gonna be united yeah
okay come on what

696
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:56,320
okay come on what
 

697
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,310
okay come on what
too much what what what is missing can

698
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:58,320
too much what what what is missing can
 

699
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,430
too much what what what is missing can
you tell me what's right

700
00:15:59,430 --> 00:15:59,440
you tell me what's right
 

701
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,430
you tell me what's right
here if you don't know i don't don't

702
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:01,440
here if you don't know i don't don't
 

703
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,550
here if you don't know i don't don't
know how to do it

704
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:02,560
know how to do it
 

705
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,470
know how to do it
you tell me what to do somewhere

706
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:06,480
you tell me what to do somewhere
 

707
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,550
you tell me what to do somewhere
yeah you can do it with the follow and

708
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:08,560
yeah you can do it with the follow and
 

709
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,189
yeah you can do it with the follow and
here what's missing here

710
00:16:11,189 --> 00:16:11,199
here what's missing here
 

711
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,590
here what's missing here
yeah and what's what's here what's

712
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:13,600
yeah and what's what's here what's
 

713
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,829
yeah and what's what's here what's
missing here there are two lines

714
00:16:15,829 --> 00:16:15,839
missing here there are two lines
 

715
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,350
missing here there are two lines
there's no two lands there's only one

716
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:17,360
there's no two lands there's only one
 

717
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,670
there's no two lands there's only one
land really yeah there's only one land

718
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:19,680
land really yeah there's only one land
 

719
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,509
land really yeah there's only one land
there's two lines there's only one left

720
00:16:21,509 --> 00:16:21,519
there's two lines there's only one left
 

721
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,829
there's two lines there's only one left
okay fine so what does it what what does

722
00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:23,839
okay fine so what does it what what does
 

723
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,030
okay fine so what does it what what does
it do here

724
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:25,040
it do here
 

725
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,829
it do here
i mean can you tell me what do i do what

726
00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:27,839
i mean can you tell me what do i do what
 

727
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:28,230
i mean can you tell me what do i do what
what's

728
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:28,240
what's
 

729
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,749
what's
need to be done here i take an element

730
00:16:31,749 --> 00:16:31,759
need to be done here i take an element
 

731
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,110
need to be done here i take an element
from the top of the stack i think i push

732
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:35,120
from the top of the stack i think i push
 

733
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,590
from the top of the stack i think i push
yeah i need to can you explain forget

734
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:37,600
yeah i need to can you explain forget
 

735
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,110
yeah i need to can you explain forget
about the thing text you just tell me

736
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:39,120
about the thing text you just tell me
 

737
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,150
about the thing text you just tell me
what to do

738
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:40,160
what to do
 

739
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,389
what to do
i mean so i take an element out of the

740
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:44,399
i mean so i take an element out of the
 

741
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:44,870
i mean so i take an element out of the
stack

742
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:44,880
stack
 

743
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,590
stack
i push it into that answer and i need to

744
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:47,600
i push it into that answer and i need to
 

745
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,710
i push it into that answer and i need to
do what i need to

746
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:48,720
do what i need to
 

747
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,990
do what i need to
append each kid his children in the

748
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:52,000
append each kid his children in the
 

749
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,430
append each kid his children in the
reverse order to the

750
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:53,440
reverse order to the
 

751
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:59,189
reverse order to the
stack right yeah so hold on

752
00:16:59,189 --> 00:16:59,199

 

753
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:07,110

yeah yeah i what's what's that

754
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:07,120

 

755
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,110

the children what's the children where's

756
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:09,120
the children what's the children where's
 

757
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,909
the children what's the children where's
the colonel's children yeah

758
00:17:11,909 --> 00:17:11,919
the colonel's children yeah
 

759
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,750
the colonel's children yeah
so kyle and the children and reverse

760
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:13,760
so kyle and the children and reverse
 

761
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:19,590
so kyle and the children and reverse
order yeah

762
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:19,600

 

763
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,150

yeah that's why it is come on yeah this

764
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:22,160
yeah that's why it is come on yeah this
 

765
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,949
yeah that's why it is come on yeah this
is the

766
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:22,959
is the
 

767
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,270
is the
non-recursion because previously we

768
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:25,280
non-recursion because previously we
 

769
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,029
non-recursion because previously we
talked about a recursion according to

770
00:17:27,029 --> 00:17:27,039
talked about a recursion according to
 

771
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,310
talked about a recursion according to
a pre-order yeah so which one is simpler

772
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:30,320
a pre-order yeah so which one is simpler
 

773
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,669
a pre-order yeah so which one is simpler
recursion one hour or this one

774
00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:33,679
recursion one hour or this one
 

775
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:39,510
recursion one hour or this one
uh maybe looks like sorry maybe

776
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:39,520

 

777
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,630

what which one do you think is

778
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:42,640
what which one do you think is
 

779
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:57,060
what which one do you think is
easier to understand

780
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:57,070

 

781
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:06,470

[Music]

782
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:06,480

 

783
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,110

okay do you still remember the recursion

784
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:09,120
okay do you still remember the recursion
 

785
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,390
okay do you still remember the recursion
one all right

786
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:10,400
one all right
 

787
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,430
one all right
yeah okay that's it because you're right

788
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:13,440
yeah okay that's it because you're right
 

789
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,350
yeah okay that's it because you're right
let's come back to this recursion one

790
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:15,360
let's come back to this recursion one
 

791
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:20,070
let's come back to this recursion one
again this still remember

792
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:20,080

 

793
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,870

all right the first of all i need to put

794
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:22,880
all right the first of all i need to put
 

795
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,870
all right the first of all i need to put
a new downward here

796
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:26,880

 

797
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,430

yeah and then i need to travel its kids

798
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:29,440
yeah and then i need to travel its kids
 

799
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,230
yeah and then i need to travel its kids
yeah for i

800
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:30,240
yeah for i
 

801
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,590
yeah for i
in

802
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:33,600

 

803
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,070

children children i watch me

804
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:38,080
children children i watch me
 

805
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,470
children children i watch me
and then i need to attend it answer

806
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:40,480
and then i need to attend it answer
 

807
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,710
and then i need to attend it answer
equal okay you can write it in this way

808
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:44,720

 

809
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,430

answer yeah and then what's this what's

810
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:47,440
answer yeah and then what's this what's
 

811
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,950
answer yeah and then what's this what's
this recursion happening

812
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:48,960
this recursion happening
 

813
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,350
this recursion happening
it's easy come on what's good something

814
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:51,360
it's easy come on what's good something
 

815
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,230
it's easy come on what's good something
with pre-order

816
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:52,240
with pre-order
 

817
00:18:52,240 --> 00:19:01,590
with pre-order
yeah i'm calling for you yes

818
