1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,640
hello hello guys hi okay so today we do

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,960
some counting problem yeah so we want to

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,920
find out the rubik's cube okay so

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,240
uh the so probably what's the do we have

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,240
a size of ruby cube like one times one

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,240
something like that normally yeah it's

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:20,960
like just like a cube yeah one times one

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,199
yeah so how many squares in rectangle

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,560
follow one times one times that one uh

10
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,480
lube cube

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,640
the zero rectangles and one

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,719
one square one square into size so how

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,880
many sides are left six so that'll be

14
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,840
six okay and how about two that's two by

15
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,879
two okay here i said that two by two so

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,440
how many

17
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,640
how many if let's consider the size okay

18
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:47,360
how many

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:50,800
squares for how many like squares for uh

20
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,879
five yeah and very much

21
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,719
yes yeah four five because there are

22
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:57,680
four little ones and um

23
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,079
one bigger one yeah so oh

24
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,559
yeah five times six thirty and how about

25
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:06,320
the squares oh how about rectangles

26
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:08,320
um four four yeah one two

27
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,840
three four okay

28
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,520
yeah okay okay and then how about the

29
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,280
three by three okay three by two which

30
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,880
is basically here three by three i can't

31
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,720
get four times four

32
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,119
three by three i can't get this through

33
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,640
quickly yeah no no let's consider the

34
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,920
three by three how many squares let's

35
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,799
say how many i'll give it four times

36
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,479
four

37
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,200
eleven

38
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,200
no wait one

39
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,040
okay so there are nine little ones

40
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,880
and then these one

41
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,600
four medium ones

42
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,280
and one big one right yeah but for the

43
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,600
square i'll follow the rectangles you'll

44
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,439
be much trickier

45
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:49,040
yeah

46
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:51,439
one two three three four five six

47
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:55,040
and seven eight nine

48
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:57,119
ten eleven twelve no

49
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,399
one yeah two

50
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,759
three

51
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,880
four

52
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,840
five oh yeah because yeah seven yeah

53
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,439
eight

54
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,479
nine ten

55
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,080
eleven

56
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,840
twelve

57
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,760
13

58
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,720
14 15

59
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,280
6 weeks you're over counting right

60
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,520
yeah but how do you get sorry no can we

61
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,360
get more than four okay so four times

62
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,040
four how so you'll be

63
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,720
much tricky right because it will be

64
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,959
much tricky to count it yeah well anyway

65
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:32,800
i think it's 22. yeah it's 22. why

66
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:35,760
one two three okay four five six

67
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:40,959
seven eight nine ten

68
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:45,760
12 13 14 15 16 i see 18 okay

69
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:47,440
um 19 20 to 1 20 oh okay okay yeah it's

70
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,239
almost a little bit complicated but

71
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,800
basically we need to count the

72
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,800
rectangles yeah the tango is the

73
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,800
different sizes

74
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:01,599
yeah all three

75
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,599
squares yeah yeah yeah okay okay so

76
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,000
yeah yeah but yeah horizontally

77
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,680
vertically but the thing is that

78
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
if i tell you

79
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,760
to i increment this n for example like

80
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,840
four term four five times five six times

81
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,599
six it will be harder more harder for us

82
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,920
to count it yeah but luckily we can use

83
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,280
the computer to count how we can come do

84
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,519
it we can

85
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,920
we can do we can do what we can brew for

86
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,879
us one corner yeah

87
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,000
on the over the left lock left top left

88
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,159
corner

89
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,440
and then pull forward

90
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:36,400
another corner yeah and this the second

91
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,480
corner needs to be on the right bottom

92
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,239
side of the first corner and now we just

93
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,640
have to check the edge

94
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:46,080
if the both edges are

95
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,280
the same then it's a square if not then

96
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,760
that's a

97
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,080
rectangle yeah okay so

98
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,480
you want to give me the answer let me fi

99
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,040
i was just saying that with the computer

100
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,680
we can we can find it we can counter

101
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,680
squares number of squares and rectangles

102
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,280
uh easily right but with the human

103
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,599
you'll be harder right so how do we

104
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,080
actually do it we just need to prove us

105
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,560
the top left corner and the right uh

106
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,640
bottom right corner of a square you know

107
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,239
it's a square of rectangle right and we

108
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,320
count it yeah we just have to check the

109
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,799
edge if it's angle equal okay so that

110
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:22,320
will be easy let's do it okay

111
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:26,000
so let's do it let's define curve

112
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:28,240
and then n yeah if n is smaller than

113
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,800
if it equals zero then obviously we need

114
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:34,560
to do what uh

115
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,320
if n is zero okay if n is zero we return

116
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,639
zero zero we return two values yeah

117
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,479
return to value which is the number of

118
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,560
the

119
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,440
edges and the number of squares number

120
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,160
of the rectangle okay now this is the

121
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,120
tricky part we go through we need to

122
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,880
uh

123
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,960
we need to count

124
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,199
yeah we need to count these

125
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,040
so first of all we need to count we need

126
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,960
to start with a

127
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,880
a a with the top left horizontal yeah

128
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,120
this is the number of the

129
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:08,160
columns oh we can say it's number of

130
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,039
rows yeah it doesn't matter so this way

131
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,160
a and b so the coordinate of the first

132
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,320
uh

133
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,360
first coordinate is a and b and the

134
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,400
second one will be c and d yeah

135
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,639
okay

136
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,880
so now we just have to put this answer

137
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,320
answer squared equals zero at the

138
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,639
beginning answer square is zero

139
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,960
rectangle

140
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,800
rectangles in the four by four

141
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,400
four by four okay and

142
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,680
one side yeah

143
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:39,280
okay okay now okay let's call

144
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,680
let's do this okay let's fall a in range

145
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,840
up to n plus one what why is it up to n

146
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,280
plus one look for the three by three

147
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:49,039
yeah look zero one two three right it's

148
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,280
up to n right so because they're three

149
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,360
by three n equals three there are

150
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,039
actually four choices for the first one

151
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,360
yeah but yeah there are four

152
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,840
possibilities

153
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:03,039
uh and then for the second row uh second

154
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:05,520
one b will be range and plus one

155
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:09,759
for the third one c will be the

156
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:11,840
the the second coordinate yes c in range

157
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,080
a plus one we start from a plus one

158
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,880
right because it has to be on the right

159
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:20,880
bottom side and then n plus one

160
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:24,000
and then for b will be in range b plus

161
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,960
one up to m plus one uh up to n okay

162
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,039
actually

163
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,000
for the first continent it doesn't

164
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,919
go to the end right because if we go to

165
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,240
the end what happens if we go to the end

166
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,680
there is no such point as the right hand

167
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,240
side right you'll be out of boundaries

168
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:42,720
so we the the first coordinate you will

169
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:45,039
be just these on this part on this uh

170
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,960
on this uh region yeah you'll be just on

171
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:50,880
this region okay

172
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:53,840
uh okay and then now we we iterate all

173
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:57,440
possibilities and what's the edge if

174
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:59,680
t minus b yeah equals

175
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,560
c minus a what happened

176
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,800
if t minus if the second coordinate

177
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,720
if t minus p equals c minus a that would

178
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,240
be a square right yeah because the both

179
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,479
sides are equal right

180
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,720
yeah yeah so then in this case i have

181
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,919
squares plus e2 right

182
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,360
otherwise

183
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,960
it's a rectangle right yeah rectangles

184
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,599
plus this one

185
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,599
okay then i have to return let's just

186
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,840
return the side a single side and we can

187
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:28,319
multiply by six right so return the

188
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,520
squares and then rectangle

189
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,599
okay and first of all let's see if

190
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:37,199
this makes sense with the small numbers

191
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:39,039
here so let's say point

192
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,080
between the

193
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:45,440
what between the

194
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:47,199
zero zero if it's yellow then you should

195
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,479
return zero right

196
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:53,360
uh okay let's let's look for n in range

197
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,560
up to four okay zero one two three okay

198
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,080
then print

199
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,919
and and then

200
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:02,479
count n okay yeah and let's see what's

201
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,479
the answer

202
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,240
is it right zero zero obviously one cube

203
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,479
is one zero two is five four right all

204
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,599
right three is fourteen two twenty two

205
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:15,039
yeah it's correct yeah yeah fourteen

206
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,879
fourteen

207
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,960
fourteen squares or three by three will

208
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,720
be q on one side and twenty two

209
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,919
rectangles okay

210
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,319
do you want me to

211
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,759
can you give me an answer for five times

212
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,440
for the

213
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,360
five times five are you looking for the

214
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,319
five times five

215
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,880
i'm

216
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,279
solving it yeah you're solving it okay

217
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,760
so that count let's just quickly give

218
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,279
answer five times right how many squares

219
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,279
and how many rectangles on the five

220
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,800
times five rubik's cube on one side okay

221
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:46,240
let's see this answer look the computer

222
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:48,560
can just do this so 55 squares and a

223
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:52,880
hundred seventies return that's a huge

224
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:55,360
number let's say 20 20 10 20. so you we

225
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,399
wouldn't be able to call these right

226
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,320
look

227
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:03,440
wow look this is huge yeah 2870

228
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:09,839
squares on a 20 by 20 rubik's cube on

229
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:09,839
one side 41 and 250 rectangles wow

230
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:17,839
uh okay i don't know if that exists okay

231
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,680
but let's we can do this mess

232
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,320
uh it takes time why is that it takes

233
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,240
some the time complexity is what can you

234
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,279
know look at this how many loops is

235
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,399
there

236
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,399
what's the time complexity

237
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,680
yeah i went to the powerful look and for

238
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:37,440
each n times you need n times and n

239
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,399
times wow actually it gives the answer

240
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,800
okay

241
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,920
it's a huge number yeah if it takes time

242
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,000
because

243
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,320
if i put a thousand and you don't give

244
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,760
me any answer in short amount of time

245
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,760
because it's too slow yeah

246
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,480
why is that because we already

247
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,959
put a check here yeah if it's yeah it's

248
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,640
a special case yeah we wouldn't be able

249
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,640
to we don't need to count it if it's

250
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,560
zero by zero yeah because it's just zero

251
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,000
or nothing yeah all right we don't need

252
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,079
to count it and at the beginning for

253
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,760
line four number five is the count

254
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:13,519
counter for the squares and for the

255
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:16,160
rectangles and then for a and b a and b

256
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,839
a b is the converse coordinate c d is

257
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,440
the second coordinate so basically we

258
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,600
are professing

259
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,920
each possibility combination of these

260
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,079
two two locations yeah and now we can

261
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,880
check the side once we have this a b and

262
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,519
c d

263
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,440
location we can check the size right if

264
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,120
the both sides are equal it's a square

265
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,560
if both sides are not equal that's a

266
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,399
rectangle right

267
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,959
yeah okay that will be

268
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,320
that'll be for today okay bye

269
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:43,760
bye bye

270
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,760
bye bye
