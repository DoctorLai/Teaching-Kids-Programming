1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,429

go hey hello mr mr ryan how are you

2
00:00:03,429 --> 00:00:03,439
go hey hello mr mr ryan how are you
 

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:03,990
go hey hello mr mr ryan how are you
today

4
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:04,000
today
 

5
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,309
today
yes okay so remember a few days ago we

6
00:00:06,309 --> 00:00:06,319
yes okay so remember a few days ago we
 

7
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:07,909
yes okay so remember a few days ago we
talked about a two sum yeah

8
00:00:07,909 --> 00:00:07,919
talked about a two sum yeah
 

9
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,830
talked about a two sum yeah
so it's given an array one two five

10
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:11,840
so it's given an array one two five
 

11
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,230
so it's given an array one two five
three two seven and given a target like

12
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:16,240
three two seven and given a target like
 

13
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,670
three two seven and given a target like
uh uh

14
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:19,680
uh uh
 

15
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,790
uh uh
five and then can you find the index two

16
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:22,800
five and then can you find the index two
 

17
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,109
five and then can you find the index two
three two three yes all three two you

18
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:25,119
three two three yes all three two you
 

19
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:26,550
three two three yes all three two you
know it just doesn't matter okay the

20
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:26,560
know it just doesn't matter okay the
 

21
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,109
know it just doesn't matter okay the
first one

22
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:27,119
first one
 

23
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,390
first one
or any one yeah so what

24
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:30,400
or any one yeah so what
 

25
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,510
or any one yeah so what
what how how are we doing this remember

26
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:35,520

 

27
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,990

the blue falls

28
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:40,000

 

29
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,750

will take the long time what's the time

30
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:41,760
will take the long time what's the time
 

31
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,350
will take the long time what's the time
complexity for the blue force

32
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:43,360
complexity for the blue force
 

33
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,790
complexity for the blue force
oh one and i think

34
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:46,800
oh one and i think
 

35
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,830
oh one and i think
something squared yeah look every time

36
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:49,840
something squared yeah look every time
 

37
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,630
something squared yeah look every time
you

38
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:50,640
you
 

39
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,110
you
you check you iterate these n numbers

40
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:53,120
you check you iterate these n numbers
 

41
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,549
you check you iterate these n numbers
and then for the second number you

42
00:00:54,549 --> 00:00:54,559
and then for the second number you
 

43
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:55,510
and then for the second number you
iterate and

44
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:55,520
iterate and
 

45
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,709
iterate and
right yeah all right

46
00:00:58,709 --> 00:00:58,719
right yeah all right
 

47
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,430
right yeah all right
okay so we can use the which which data

48
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:01,440
okay so we can use the which which data
 

49
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,549
okay so we can use the which which data
structure can

50
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:02,559
structure can
 

51
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:07,190
structure can
we can use to speed it up

52
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:07,200

 

53
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,910

notebook notebook yes because we when we

54
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:09,920
notebook notebook yes because we when we
 

55
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,870
notebook notebook yes because we when we
visit

56
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:10,880
visit
 

57
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,590
visit
once we remember it on the notebook and

58
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:13,600
once we remember it on the notebook and
 

59
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,390
once we remember it on the notebook and
then we check

60
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:14,400
then we check
 

61
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,789
then we check
if the target minus the current number

62
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:16,799
if the target minus the current number
 

63
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,230
if the target minus the current number
if it's in the notebook right do you

64
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:18,240
if it's in the notebook right do you
 

65
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,830
if it's in the notebook right do you
understand yeah

66
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:19,840
understand yeah
 

67
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,230
understand yeah
i'm gonna talk about something like

68
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:22,240
i'm gonna talk about something like
 

69
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,590
i'm gonna talk about something like
three of them

70
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:23,600
three of them
 

71
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,910
three of them
oh good good point the other maybe maybe

72
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:25,920
oh good good point the other maybe maybe
 

73
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,350
oh good good point the other maybe maybe
not not today but maybe

74
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:27,360
not not today but maybe
 

75
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,230
not not today but maybe
later on for some five some right so

76
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:30,240
later on for some five some right so
 

77
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,350
later on for some five some right so
today we'll talk about

78
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:31,360
today we'll talk about
 

79
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,469
today we'll talk about
if the array is started what happened

80
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:34,479
if the array is started what happened
 

81
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,429
if the array is started what happened
so even arrangement much easier really

82
00:01:37,429 --> 00:01:37,439
so even arrangement much easier really
 

83
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,630
so even arrangement much easier really
okay let's say

84
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:38,640
okay let's say
 

85
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,310
okay let's say
one two four seven you need comments

86
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:42,320
one two four seven you need comments
 

87
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,350
one two four seven you need comments
okay one two three four thousand hey

88
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:45,360
okay one two three four thousand hey
 

89
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,389
okay one two three four thousand hey
let's try find if there are five

90
00:01:48,389 --> 00:01:48,399
let's try find if there are five
 

91
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,429
let's try find if there are five
so how do if this array is sorted

92
00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:51,439
so how do if this array is sorted
 

93
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,749
so how do if this array is sorted
it's auto three yeah how do you get it

94
00:01:53,749 --> 00:01:53,759
it's auto three yeah how do you get it
 

95
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,030
it's auto three yeah how do you get it
how do you

96
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:55,040
how do you
 

97
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,270
how do you
do you can you come up with the fast

98
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:57,280
do you can you come up with the fast
 

99
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,709
do you can you come up with the fast
agreement to do it or

100
00:01:58,709 --> 00:01:58,719
agreement to do it or
 

101
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,709
agreement to do it or
in one time can you do it and i went

102
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:00,719
in one time can you do it and i went
 

103
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,910
in one time can you do it and i went
down

104
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:03,920

 

105
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,630

remember we talked about i'll give you a

106
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:06,640
remember we talked about i'll give you a
 

107
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,830
remember we talked about i'll give you a
hand how about if i

108
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:07,840
hand how about if i
 

109
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,949
hand how about if i
start here and here

110
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:10,959
start here and here
 

111
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,990
start here and here
one person yeah yeah okay so

112
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:14,000
one person yeah yeah okay so
 

113
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,750
one person yeah yeah okay so
if if you just add them up together

114
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:17,760
if if you just add them up together
 

115
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,869
if if you just add them up together
and then if it's bigger

116
00:02:20,869 --> 00:02:20,879
and then if it's bigger
 

117
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,600
and then if it's bigger
if

118
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:23,610
if
 

119
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,030
if
[Music]

120
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:27,040

 

121
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,309

yeah yeah okay okay still bigger yeah

122
00:02:30,309 --> 00:02:30,319
yeah yeah okay okay still bigger yeah
 

123
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,990
yeah yeah okay okay still bigger yeah
and go here yeah and you'll find it

124
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:32,000
and go here yeah and you'll find it
 

125
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,910
and go here yeah and you'll find it
if it's smaller you move it right yeah

126
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:33,920
if it's smaller you move it right yeah
 

127
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,229
if it's smaller you move it right yeah
that's time complexity okay yeah does it

128
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:36,239
that's time complexity okay yeah does it
 

129
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,910
that's time complexity okay yeah does it
make sense

130
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:37,920
make sense
 

131
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,390
make sense
so the this requires the array to be

132
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:40,400
so the this requires the array to be
 

133
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,190
so the this requires the array to be
sorted yeah

134
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:41,200
sorted yeah
 

135
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,830
sorted yeah
all right yeah okay can we cover this

136
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:43,840
all right yeah okay can we cover this
 

137
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,670
all right yeah okay can we cover this
quickly

138
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:47,680

00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:54,480
if m i plus number j smaller than t
 

173
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:06,180
if m i plus number j smaller than t
uh we move i i what

174
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:06,190

 

175
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:21,590

[Music]

176
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:21,600

 

177
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,189

yeah okay another

178
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:25,199
yeah okay another
 

179
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,270
yeah okay another
another look okay so this is all end

180
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:27,280
another look okay so this is all end
 

181
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,310
another look okay so this is all end
time and what's the space complexity

182
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:30,320
time and what's the space complexity
 

183
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,430
time and what's the space complexity
i think owen where are we using the

184
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:33,440
i think owen where are we using the
 

185
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,189
i think owen where are we using the
space here

186
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:35,199
space here
 

187
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,870
space here
which which do you think is always in

188
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:36,880
which which do you think is always in
 

189
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,550
which which do you think is always in
space

190
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:40,560

 

191
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,629

are there any space we need to use nope

192
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:42,639
are there any space we need to use nope
 

193
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,710
are there any space we need to use nope
no what's it

194
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:44,720
no what's it
 

195
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,909
no what's it
one constant okay so one constant

196
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:47,919
one constant okay so one constant
 

197
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,350
one constant okay so one constant
and how about that yeah that's okay one

198
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:51,360
and how about that yeah that's okay one
 

199
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,469
and how about that yeah that's okay one
two three four five seven

200
00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:54,479
two three four five seven
 

201
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,749
two three four five seven
nine okay so let's look for number five

202
00:04:57,749 --> 00:04:57,759
nine okay so let's look for number five
 

203
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,430
nine okay so let's look for number five
and if we can hold

204
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:01,440
and if we can hold
 

205
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,670
and if we can hold
yeah i know we can use the two pointer

206
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:03,680
yeah i know we can use the two pointer
 

207
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,870
yeah i know we can use the two pointer
just like that moving

208
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:04,880
just like that moving
 

209
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,189
just like that moving
towards until the mid in scenario how

210
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:07,199
towards until the mid in scenario how
 

211
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,189
towards until the mid in scenario how
about if we use another approach like

212
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:09,199
about if we use another approach like
 

213
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,189
about if we use another approach like
you know we because this array is

214
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:11,199
you know we because this array is
 

215
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,550
you know we because this array is
already sorted let's

216
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:12,560
already sorted let's
 

217
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,749
already sorted let's
just check this number yeah

218
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:15,759
just check this number yeah
 

219
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,710
just check this number yeah
fix try the first number like 1 and

220
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:18,720
fix try the first number like 1 and
 

221
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,070
fix try the first number like 1 and
let's find

222
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:20,080
let's find
 

223
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,430
let's find
if the rest of the numbers have the 4

224
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:23,440
if the rest of the numbers have the 4
 

225
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,550
if the rest of the numbers have the 4
because 5 minus 1 is 4 yeah all right

226
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:26,560
because 5 minus 1 is 4 yeah all right
 

227
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,670
because 5 minus 1 is 4 yeah all right
yeah and if let's try 2 if there are

228
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:29,680
yeah and if let's try 2 if there are
 

229
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,950
yeah and if let's try 2 if there are
3 in the in this part right

230
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:32,960
3 in the in this part right
 

231
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,430
3 in the in this part right
all right so basically we can try the

232
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:35,440
all right so basically we can try the
 

233
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,230
all right so basically we can try the
first number

234
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:36,240
first number
 

235
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,909
first number
1 2 three four five and now we try the

236
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:39,919
1 2 three four five and now we try the
 

237
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,870
1 2 three four five and now we try the
the number next to it right to it

238
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:42,880
the number next to it right to it
 

239
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,390
the number next to it right to it
because it's already sorted

240
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:44,400
because it's already sorted
 

241
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,469
because it's already sorted
and we're looking for the number which

242
00:05:46,469 --> 00:05:46,479
and we're looking for the number which
 

243
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,230
and we're looking for the number which
is five minus one

244
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:48,240
is five minus one
 

245
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,550
is five minus one
minus that number so what was this

246
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:50,560
minus that number so what was this
 

247
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,710
minus that number so what was this
finding a number in a sorted array

248
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:52,720
finding a number in a sorted array
 

249
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,430
finding a number in a sorted array
what is it what what it is the time

250
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:55,440
what is it what what it is the time

00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,790
what is it what what it is the time
complexity

252
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:56,800
complexity
 

253

finding a the number in a sorted array
 

255
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,670
finding a the number in a sorted array
what's the time complexity you're

256
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:01,680
what's the time complexity you're
 

257
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,350
what's the time complexity you're
finding

258
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:05,360

 

259
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,710

sorry i think n o one

260
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:08,720
sorry i think n o one
 

261
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,350
sorry i think n o one
finding it in a sorted array sorted or

262
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:11,360
finding it in a sorted array sorted or
 

263
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,390
finding it in a sorted array sorted or
refining a number

264
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:12,400
refining a number
 

265
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,710
refining a number
you always checking how right uh go

266
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:14,720
you always checking how right uh go
 

267
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,909
you always checking how right uh go
again log n

268
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:15,919
again log n
 

269
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,990
again log n
okay i don't tell you what the first

270
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,000
okay i don't tell you what the first
 

271
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,430
okay i don't tell you what the first
number is n right

272
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:19,440
number is n right
 

273
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,830
number is n right
yeah so it needs time n times log n all

274
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:21,840
yeah so it needs time n times log n all
 

275
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,469
yeah so it needs time n times log n all
right

276
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:22,479
right
 

277
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,510
right
okay so let's do it

278
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:25,520
okay so let's do it
 

279
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,070
okay so let's do it
let's do it yeah so look first of all i

280
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,080
let's do it yeah so look first of all i
 

281
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,749
let's do it yeah so look first of all i
need to define the binary search yeah

282
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:29,759
need to define the binary search yeah
 

283
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:30,950
need to define the binary search yeah
define

284
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:30,960
define
 

285
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,749
define
final research okay yes and then let's

286
00:06:33,749 --> 00:06:33,759
final research okay yes and then let's
 

287
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:34,150
final research okay yes and then let's
do

288
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:34,160
do
 

289
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,710
do
uh i for the left okay maybe left

290
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:38,720
uh i for the left okay maybe left
 

291
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,029
uh i for the left okay maybe left
and right okay and then we're looking

292
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:41,039
and right okay and then we're looking
 

293
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,270
and right okay and then we're looking
for the number t

294
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:43,280
for the number t
 

295
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,469
for the number t
right yes yeah yeah

296
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:46,479
right yes yeah yeah
 

297
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,950
right yes yeah yeah
okay so how how do we suppose we know

298
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:48,960
okay so how how do we suppose we know
 

299
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,350
okay so how how do we suppose we know
the numbers here while

300
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:51,360
the numbers here while
 

301
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,469
the numbers here while
left smaller equals right okay

302
00:06:56,469 --> 00:06:56,479

 

303
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:01,990

what's the meter the middle is

304
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:02,000
what's the meter the middle is
 

305
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,350
what's the meter the middle is
equal left and right left and right

306
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:05,360
equal left and right left and right
 

307
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,469
equal left and right left and right
divided by two okay the right you will

308
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:08,479
divided by two okay the right you will
 

309
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,189
divided by two okay the right you will
use the double double divide okay

310
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:11,199
use the double double divide okay
 

311
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:27,350
use the double double divide okay
and look if nums

312
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:27,360

 

313
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,629

if nums

314
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:30,639
if nums
 

315
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,990
if nums
meat smaller than t

316
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:34,000
meat smaller than t
 

317
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,990
meat smaller than t
what should we do if t is bigger than

318
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:36,000
what should we do if t is bigger than
 

319
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,430
what should we do if t is bigger than
half so

320
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:37,440
half so
 

321
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,469
half so
look this is the meter if

322
00:07:40,469 --> 00:07:40,479
look this is the meter if
 

323
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,029
look this is the meter if
the number we are looking for is on the

324
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:43,039
the number we are looking for is on the
 

325
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:43,670
the number we are looking for is on the
this side

326
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:43,680
this side
 

327
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:50,230
this side
so what should we do

328
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:50,240

 

329
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,550

we should t is here because this is

330
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:52,560
we should t is here because this is
 

331
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,350
we should t is here because this is
middle this is

332
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:53,360
middle this is
 

333
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,990
middle this is
l this is r and that is meter and then

334
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:56,000
l this is r and that is meter and then
 

335
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,070
l this is r and that is meter and then
the number we're looking for is t

336
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:58,080
the number we're looking for is t
 

337
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,550
the number we're looking for is t
we cut it in half again yeah but so we

338
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:00,560
we cut it in half again yeah but so we
 

339
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:09,430
we cut it in half again yeah but so we
need to move left to mid or otherwise

340
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:09,440
need to move left to mid or otherwise
 

341
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:09,990
need to move left to mid or otherwise
what

342
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,000
what
 

343
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,070
what
it is if it's smaller

344
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:14,080
it is if it's smaller
 

345
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,710
it is if it's smaller
if it's indeed this half or also if this

346
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:16,720
if it's indeed this half or also if this
 

347
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,510
if it's indeed this half or also if this
thing is in

348
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:17,520
thing is in
 

349
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,510
thing is in
this half

350
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:21,520

 

351
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:30,070

right equals minus one

352
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,080

 

353
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:37,990

[Music]

354
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:38,000

 

355
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,430

this complexity is 01. yeah

356
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:41,440
this complexity is 01. yeah
 

357
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,870
this complexity is 01. yeah
what's the space complexity for this one

358
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:44,880
what's the space complexity for this one
 

359
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,630
what's the space complexity for this one
or something here oh what do we need

360
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:48,640

 

361
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,030

also or what do we need a space one

362
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,040

 

363
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,750

this yeah b is left to right okay that's

364
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:55,760
this yeah b is left to right okay that's
 

365
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,070
this yeah b is left to right okay that's
right

366
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:56,080
right
 

367
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,829
right
b is left right here okay remember this

368
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:57,839
b is left right here okay remember this
 

369
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,590
b is left right here okay remember this
function here

370
00:08:59,590 --> 00:08:59,600
function here
 

371
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,550
function here
and then look so what should we just do

372
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:02,560
and then look so what should we just do
 

373
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:02,949
and then look so what should we just do
look

374
00:09:02,949 --> 00:09:02,959
look
 

375
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,829
look
for i in

376
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:06,839
for i in
 

377
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:10,550
for i in
range lens number yeah the first number

378
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:10,560
range lens number yeah the first number
 

379
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,110
range lens number yeah the first number
yeah

380
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:11,120
yeah
 

381
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,070
yeah
the number first number is i the index

382
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:14,080
the number first number is i the index
 

383
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,470
the number first number is i the index
is i

384
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:14,480
is i
 

385
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,750
is i
right yeah and the number we are looking

386
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:17,760
right yeah and the number we are looking
 

387
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,310
right yeah and the number we are looking
for is

388
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:18,320
for is
 

389
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,430
for is
let's say a equals t minus

390
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:21,440
let's say a equals t minus
 

391
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,790
let's say a equals t minus
nums i right yeah

392
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:24,800
nums i right yeah
 

393
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,310
nums i right yeah
this is normal we're looking for look

394
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:26,320
this is normal we're looking for look
 

395
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,829
this is normal we're looking for look
alright yeah

396
00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:27,839
alright yeah
 

397
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,470
alright yeah
all right yeah because we want to add it

398
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:30,480
all right yeah because we want to add it
 

399
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:30,949
all right yeah because we want to add it
to t

400
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:30,959
to t
 

401
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,230
to t
and we know we are we we are now numbers

402
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:34,240
and we know we are we we are now numbers
 

403
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:34,870
and we know we are we we are now numbers
i right

404
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:34,880
i right
 

405
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,389
i right
and the numbers we're looking for is a

406
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:36,399
and the numbers we're looking for is a
 

407
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,990
and the numbers we're looking for is a
right yeah then

408
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:38,000
right yeah then
 

409
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,430
right yeah then
if bs what's the left

410
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:41,440
if bs what's the left
 

411
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,710
if bs what's the left
what should i do the left left

412
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:44,720
what should i do the left left
 

413
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,389
what should i do the left left
right will be length num

414
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:48,399
right will be length num
 

415
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,990
right will be length num
minus one right and then a

416
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:52,000
minus one right and then a
 

417
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,110
minus one right and then a
returns true right does it make sense so

418
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:55,120
returns true right does it make sense so
 

419
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,070
returns true right does it make sense so
can you fill in

420
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:56,080
can you fill in
 

421
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:02,470
can you fill in
here we can return what here return what

422
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:02,480

 

423
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,829

which entry

424
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:07,839

 

425
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,590

remember this is the left this is the

426
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:09,600
remember this is the left this is the
 

427
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,509
remember this is the left this is the
right so what's the left value i should

428
00:10:11,509 --> 00:10:11,519
right so what's the left value i should
 

429
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,230
right so what's the left value i should
put

430
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:12,240
put
 

431
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,630
put
i should give i have to find a research

432
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:14,640
i should give i have to find a research
 

433
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,190
i should give i have to find a research
so look

434
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:17,200

 

435
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,110

we are fixing this this is i we are

436
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:19,120
we are fixing this this is i we are
 

437
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,790
we are fixing this this is i we are
currently here

438
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:20,800
currently here
 

439
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,350
currently here
and we want to find the value the final

440
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:23,360
and we want to find the value the final
 

441
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,470
and we want to find the value the final
research here because the

442
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:24,480
research here because the
 

443
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,790
research here because the
entire array is sorted yeah we try this

444
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:26,800
entire array is sorted yeah we try this
 

445
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,670
entire array is sorted yeah we try this
first number one

446
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:27,680
first number one
 

447
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,790
first number one
two and we want to find the for example

448
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:30,800
two and we want to find the for example
 

449
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,870
two and we want to find the for example
five minus two find the number three

450
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:32,880
five minus two find the number three
 

451
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,790
five minus two find the number three
in the rest so what should i put here

452
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:34,800
in the rest so what should i put here
 

453
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,910
in the rest so what should i put here
the left what's

454
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:35,920
the left what's
 

455
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,710
the left what's
why does the e go left what's left

456
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:40,720
why does the e go left what's left
 

457
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,790
why does the e go left what's left
i add one yeah that's what i'm looking

458
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:42,800
i add one yeah that's what i'm looking
 

459
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,550
i add one yeah that's what i'm looking
for come on yeah

460
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:44,560
for come on yeah
 

461
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,750
for come on yeah
place

462
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:49,760

 

463
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,110

so look this is o and yeah this loop

464
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:53,120
so look this is o and yeah this loop
 

465
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,310
so look this is o and yeah this loop
yeah all right and this is final

466
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:56,320
yeah all right and this is final
 

467
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,269
yeah all right and this is final
research in

468
00:10:57,269 --> 00:10:57,279
research in
 

469
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,310
research in
in the

470
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:00,320
in the
 

471
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,430
in the
in the rest so it'll be o log n normally

472
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:03,440
in the rest so it'll be o log n normally
 

473
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,750
in the rest so it'll be o log n normally
actually look because every time if

474
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:05,760
actually look because every time if
 

475
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,350
actually look because every time if
you're not putting a i minus 1 if you

476
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:07,360
you're not putting a i minus 1 if you
 

477
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,670
you're not putting a i minus 1 if you
put a 0 it will still work

478
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:09,680
put a 0 it will still work
 

479
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,110
put a 0 it will still work
right it will still work because your

480
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:11,120
right it will still work because your
 

481
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,949
right it will still work because your
brand is in the whole

482
00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:12,959
brand is in the whole
 

483
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,269
brand is in the whole
array right yeah but there are some

484
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:15,279
array right yeah but there are some
 

485
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,110
array right yeah but there are some
repeated

486
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:17,120
repeated
 

487
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,590
repeated
range because look i already tried one

488
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:19,600
range because look i already tried one
 

489
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,030
range because look i already tried one
two three

490
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:21,040
two three
 

491
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,110
two three
right i don't need to search for the

492
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:23,120
right i don't need to search for the
 

493
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,790
right i don't need to search for the
elements before me right because i

494
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:24,800
elements before me right because i
 

495
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,310
elements before me right because i
already searched it right

496
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:26,320
already searched it right
 

497
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,550
already searched it right
that doesn't make sense yeah so you're

498
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:28,560
that doesn't make sense yeah so you're
 

499
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,389
that doesn't make sense yeah so you're
narrowing down you're narrowing the

500
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:30,399
narrowing down you're narrowing the
 

501
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,790
narrowing down you're narrowing the
search space for the binary search

502
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:32,800
search space for the binary search
 

503
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,710
search space for the binary search
eric does it make sense so you'll be

504
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:34,720
eric does it make sense so you'll be
 

505
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,790
eric does it make sense so you'll be
quicker but actually the time complexity

506
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:36,800
quicker but actually the time complexity
 

507
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,829
quicker but actually the time complexity
is there

508
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:37,839
is there
 

509
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,350
is there
oh and log n actually is o n o

510
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:41,360
oh and log n actually is o n o
 

511
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,710
oh and log n actually is o n o
and log n and this n is getting smaller

512
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:44,720
and log n and this n is getting smaller
 

513
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,590
and log n and this n is getting smaller
right array

514
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:45,600
right array
 

515
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,150
right array
this n is getting smaller but its sphere

516
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:48,160
this n is getting smaller but its sphere
 

517
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,829
this n is getting smaller but its sphere
is in the

518
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:49,839
is in the
 

519
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,790
is in the
same square of this n so it's a constant

520
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:52,800
same square of this n so it's a constant
 

521
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,190
same square of this n so it's a constant
here

522
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:53,200
here
 

523
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,829
here
so we we drop the constant all right

524
00:11:55,829 --> 00:11:55,839
so we we drop the constant all right
 

525
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:56,790
so we we drop the constant all right
does it make sense so

526
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:56,800
does it make sense so
 

527
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,269
does it make sense so
it's still oh and open am i right look

528
00:11:59,269 --> 00:11:59,279
it's still oh and open am i right look
 

529
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,150
it's still oh and open am i right look
yeah

530
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:00,160
yeah
 

531
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,310
yeah
yeah i'm right so can you tell me what

532
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:02,320
yeah i'm right so can you tell me what
 

533
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,710
yeah i'm right so can you tell me what
should i put here

534
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:04,720
should i put here
 

535
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,150
should i put here
okay that's it what for i in range

536
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:08,160
okay that's it what for i in range
 

537
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,030
okay that's it what for i in range
this and a what's the a what's the value

538
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:11,040
this and a what's the a what's the value
 

539
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,310
this and a what's the a what's the value
we are looking for

540
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:12,320
we are looking for
 

541
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,470
we are looking for
what's a equals something about

542
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:16,480
what's a equals something about
 

543
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,550
what's a equals something about
because a lumps

544
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:20,560
because a lumps
 

545
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,590
because a lumps
i this is current the first number

546
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:23,600
i this is current the first number
 

547
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,069
i this is current the first number
plus something equals the target number

548
00:12:26,069 --> 00:12:26,079
plus something equals the target number
 

549
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,990
plus something equals the target number
so this is the number we are looking for

550
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:28,000
so this is the number we are looking for
 

551
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,670
so this is the number we are looking for
so a equals one

552
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:29,680
so a equals one
 

553
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,790
so a equals one
t this is x t

554
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:32,800
t this is x t
 

555
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,829
t this is x t
one minus

556
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:35,839
one minus
 

557
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,269
one minus
i yeah come on this is super easy yeah

558
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:39,279
i yeah come on this is super easy yeah
 

559
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,110
i yeah come on this is super easy yeah
right and then we search it for remember

560
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:41,120
right and then we search it for remember
 

561
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,470
right and then we search it for remember
this p is from here yeah

562
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:42,480
this p is from here yeah
 

563
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,750
this p is from here yeah
oh log n yeah this is o n n times

564
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:45,760
oh log n yeah this is o n n times
 

565
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,030
oh log n yeah this is o n n times
log n times so the complexity is what

566
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:49,040
log n times so the complexity is what
 

567
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,829
log n times so the complexity is what
oh and log n what's the stake some

568
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:50,839
oh and log n what's the stake some
 

569
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:52,310
oh and log n what's the stake some
complexity

570
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:52,320
complexity
 

571
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,509
complexity
one yeah well done yeah my favorite your

572
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:55,519
one yeah well done yeah my favorite your
 

573
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:56,550
one yeah well done yeah my favorite your
favorite but sometimes

574
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:56,560
favorite but sometimes
 

575
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,150
favorite but sometimes
it's not true yeah you're just guessing

576
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:58,160
it's not true yeah you're just guessing
 

577
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,069
it's not true yeah you're just guessing
guessing okay

578
00:13:00,069 --> 00:13:00,079
guessing okay
 

579
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,829
guessing okay
that's it for today so does it make

580
00:13:01,829 --> 00:13:01,839
that's it for today so does it make
 

581
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,430
that's it for today so does it make
sense today

582
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:03,440
sense today
 

583
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,839
sense today
good say bye to people
