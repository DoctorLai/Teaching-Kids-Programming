00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,669

oh hello hello mr mr ryan how are you

2
00:00:03,669 --> 00:00:03,679
oh hello hello mr mr ryan how are you
 

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:04,309
oh hello hello mr mr ryan how are you
today

4
00:00:04,309 --> 00:00:04,319
today
 

5
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,389
today
okay today we'll talk about intervals

6
00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:06,399
okay today we'll talk about intervals
 

7
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:08,230
okay today we'll talk about intervals
again yeah we talked about some internal

8
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:08,240
again yeah we talked about some internal
 

9
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,070
again yeah we talked about some internal
problems before and then we talked about

10
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:10,080
problems before and then we talked about
 

11
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,549
problems before and then we talked about
another interval problem okay

12
00:00:12,549 --> 00:00:12,559
another interval problem okay
 

13
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,990
another interval problem okay
right that's funny okay so let's say we

14
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:16,000
right that's funny okay so let's say we
 

15
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,870
right that's funny okay so let's say we
have two

16
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:16,880
have two
 

17
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,590
have two
uh intervals they are sorted remember

18
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:19,600
uh intervals they are sorted remember
 

19
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,349
uh intervals they are sorted remember
first of all it's sorted

20
00:00:21,349 --> 00:00:21,359
first of all it's sorted
 

21
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,670
first of all it's sorted
what i mean sorted is that the intervals

22
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:23,680
what i mean sorted is that the intervals
 

23
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,109
what i mean sorted is that the intervals
are given from the left

24
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:25,119
are given from the left
 

25
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,750
are given from the left
right in in the numbers yeah look here

26
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:27,760
right in in the numbers yeah look here
 

27
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,029
right in in the numbers yeah look here
this is the number

28
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:29,039
this is the number
 

29
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,229
this is the number
number line right number zero here

30
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:32,239
number line right number zero here
 

31
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:35,670
number line right number zero here
one so each each number i mark it here

32
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:35,680
one so each each number i mark it here
 

33
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,110
one so each each number i mark it here
yeah one two

34
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:39,120
yeah one two
 

35
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:50,869
yeah one two
zero one two five yeah

36
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:50,879

 

37
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,150

so i have a look here i have one three

38
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:54,160
so i have a look here i have one three
 

39
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,470
so i have a look here i have one three
one three okay and one three here this

40
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:56,480
one three okay and one three here this
 

41
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:07,890
one three okay and one three here this
is the interval

42
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:07,900

 

43
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:11,670

[Music]

44
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:11,680

 

45
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,990

right okay so that's three three

46
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:14,000
right okay so that's three three
 

47
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,030
right okay so that's three three
intervals

48
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:15,040
intervals
 

49
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,830
intervals
one three five six seven nine it's

50
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:17,840
one three five six seven nine it's
 

51
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,149
one three five six seven nine it's
inclusive so the emperor

52
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:20,159
inclusive so the emperor
 

53
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,030
inclusive so the emperor
yeah separate look this is star and star

54
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:23,040
yeah separate look this is star and star
 

55
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,190
yeah separate look this is star and star
and star n so this is the

56
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:25,200
and star n so this is the
 

57
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,990
and star n so this is the
interval and another b what i mean the

58
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:28,000
interval and another b what i mean the
 

59
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,710
interval and another b what i mean the
given

60
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:28,720
given
 

61
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,710
given
sorted is that look we are given from

62
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:30,720
sorted is that look we are given from
 

63
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,390
sorted is that look we are given from
left to the right okay

64
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:32,400
left to the right okay
 

65
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,469
left to the right okay
and the b interval will be something

66
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:34,479
and the b interval will be something
 

67
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,710
and the b interval will be something
like one four

68
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:36,720
like one four
 

69
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,069
like one four
one four here yeah and

70
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:40,079
one four here yeah and
 

71
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,590
one four here yeah and
maybe five seven

72
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:43,600
maybe five seven
 

73
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,789
maybe five seven
okay ryan

74
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:46,799
okay ryan
 

75
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,310
okay ryan
don't think yeah i'm not singing okay so

76
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:50,320
don't think yeah i'm not singing okay so
 

77
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,190
don't think yeah i'm not singing okay so
look

78
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:51,200
look
 

79
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,429
look
so you now need to tell me the combine

80
00:01:55,429 --> 00:01:55,439
so you now need to tell me the combine
 

81
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,910
so you now need to tell me the combine
okay let's connect it so it's uh

82
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:57,920
okay let's connect it so it's uh
 

83
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,789
okay let's connect it so it's uh
intercept

84
00:01:58,789 --> 00:01:58,799
intercept
 

85
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,389
intercept
so which is one four no one

86
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:02,399
so which is one four no one
 

87
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,789
so which is one four no one
one three here and

88
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:06,799

 

89
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,710

five but again we have a seven here yeah

90
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:10,720
five but again we have a seven here yeah
 

91
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,949
five but again we have a seven here yeah
look at this point yeah yeah so you need

92
00:02:12,949 --> 00:02:12,959
look at this point yeah yeah so you need
 

93
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:13,830
look at this point yeah yeah so you need
to tell me

94
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:13,840
to tell me
 

95
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,030
to tell me
yeah seven seven we're done so does it

96
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,040
yeah seven seven we're done so does it
 

97
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,910
yeah seven seven we're done so does it
make

98
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:17,920
make
 

99
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:23,680
make
is it clear yeah is it clear got it

100
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:23,690
is it clear yeah is it clear got it

so how do we know first of all in order

104
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:28,239
so how do we know first of all in order
 

105
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,550
so how do we know first of all in order
to solve this problem how do we know

106
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:30,560
to solve this problem how do we know
 

107
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,509
to solve this problem how do we know
the two intervals are connected or not i

108
00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:33,519
the two intervals are connected or not i
 

109
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:34,150
the two intervals are connected or not i
have this

110
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:34,160
have this
 

111
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,589
have this
intersection point or not if this is a b

112
00:02:37,589 --> 00:02:37,599
intersection point or not if this is a b
 

113
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,630
intersection point or not if this is a b
and then infinity is cb

114
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:40,640
and then infinity is cb
 

115
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,790
and then infinity is cb
how many kinds of relations does it have

if you can swap a and b these two are

142
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:19,680
if you can swap a and b these two are
 

143
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,710
if you can swap a and b these two are
the same

144
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:20,720
the same
 

145
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,550
the same
and maybe they can be like

146
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:24,560
and maybe they can be like
 

147
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,589

oh yeah okay yeah yeah this is similar

148
00:03:27,589 --> 00:03:27,599
oh yeah okay yeah yeah this is similar
 

149
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,430
oh yeah okay yeah yeah this is similar
to this one it's the same

150
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:29,440
to this one it's the same
 

151
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,869
to this one it's the same
okay so we oh of course for this kind of

152
00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:32,879
okay so we oh of course for this kind of
 

153
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,910
okay so we oh of course for this kind of
uh we can check right for example

154
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:35,920
uh we can check right for example
 

155
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,190
uh we can check right for example
for this one we can check if a a

156
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:39,200
for this one we can check if a a
 

157
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,229
for this one we can check if a a
this is a b if c if c is between a

158
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:42,239
this is a b if c if c is between a
 

159
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,430
this is a b if c if c is between a
and b right right yeah or

160
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:45,440
and b right right yeah or
 

161
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,630
and b right right yeah or
or for example this one uh

162
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:48,640
or for example this one uh
 

163
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,350
or for example this one uh
this one then we can say if a is between

164
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:51,360
this one then we can say if a is between
 

165
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,789
this one then we can say if a is between
c and d

166
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:52,799
c and d
 

167
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,589
c and d
yeah yeah but we have a better one which

168
00:03:55,589 --> 00:03:55,599
yeah yeah but we have a better one which
 

169
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,830
yeah yeah but we have a better one which
is to do what

170
00:03:58,830 --> 00:03:58,840

 

171
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,869

looks look if we get the maximum of the

172
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:02,879
looks look if we get the maximum of the
 

173
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,470
looks look if we get the maximum of the
starting point

174
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:04,480
starting point
 

175
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,589
starting point
the maximum of starting point a b and

176
00:04:07,589 --> 00:04:07,599
the maximum of starting point a b and
 

177
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,830
the maximum of starting point a b and
the minimum of the ending point right

178
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:09,840
the minimum of the ending point right
 

179
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,830
the minimum of the ending point right
yeah doesn't make sense minimum ending

180
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:11,840
yeah doesn't make sense minimum ending
 

181
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,509
yeah doesn't make sense minimum ending
point

182
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:13,519
point
 

183
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,469
point
right look the intersection of these a b

184
00:04:16,469 --> 00:04:16,479
right look the intersection of these a b
 

185
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:17,030
right look the intersection of these a b
and c d

186
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:17,040
and c d
 

187
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,590
and c d
is what which bar is this far right

188
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:21,600
is what which bar is this far right
 

189
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,030
is what which bar is this far right
so this is max a and c right and this is

190
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:25,040
so this is max a and c right and this is
 

191
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,749
so this is max a and c right and this is
the mean of

192
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:25,759
the mean of
 

193
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,909
the mean of
b and d right that's the end yeah right

194
00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:29,919
b and d right that's the end yeah right
 

195
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,550
b and d right that's the end yeah right
so we want to get the maximum of star

196
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:32,560
so we want to get the maximum of star
 

197
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,310
so we want to get the maximum of star
and the minimum of the n

198
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:34,320
and the minimum of the n
 

199
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,430
and the minimum of the n
right so if star is smaller than n we

200
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:37,440
right so if star is smaller than n we
 

201
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,950
right so if star is smaller than n we
have an intersection

202
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:38,960
have an intersection
 

203
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,710
have an intersection
right can you draw a one which it does

204
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:42,720
right can you draw a one which it does
 

205
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,070
right can you draw a one which it does
not have intersection

206
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:46,080

 

207
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,670

okay so look at abcd what's the maximum

208
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:49,680
okay so look at abcd what's the maximum
 

209
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,070
okay so look at abcd what's the maximum
of a

210
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,080
of a
 

211
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,350
of a
anc starting point

212
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:53,360

 

213
00:04:53,360 --> 00:05:02,150

what's the meaning of

214
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:02,160

 

215
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,550

the star is bigger than the end then

216
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:04,560
the star is bigger than the end then
 

217
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,430
the star is bigger than the end then
let's notice

218
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:05,440
let's notice
 

219
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,150
let's notice
uh connection all right there's no it's

220
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:08,160
uh connection all right there's no it's
 

221
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,310
uh connection all right there's no it's
disjoint right all right

222
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:10,320
disjoint right all right
 

223
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,150
disjoint right all right
yeah okay so we this is the basic of

224
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,160
yeah okay so we this is the basic of
 

225
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,510
yeah okay so we this is the basic of
checking the two intervals

226
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:15,520
checking the two intervals
 

227
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,510
checking the two intervals
if that to see if we we have this

228
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:17,520
if that to see if we we have this
 

229
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,950
if that to see if we we have this
intersection between them

230
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:18,960
intersection between them
 

231
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,870
intersection between them
so for now we can have two pointers

232
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:20,880
so for now we can have two pointers
 

233
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,990
so for now we can have two pointers
right eric

234
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:22,000
right eric
 

235
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,510
right eric
to scale from the left to the right okay

236
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:25,520
to scale from the left to the right okay
 

237
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,870
to scale from the left to the right okay
and if they are this if they are

238
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:28,880
and if they are this if they are
 

239
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,150
and if they are this if they are
already okay

240
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:32,160
already okay
 

241
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,790
already okay
if the star is smaller than n then we

242
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:34,800
if the star is smaller than n then we
 

243
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,230
if the star is smaller than n then we
push the star and end

244
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:36,240
push the star and end
 

245
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,990
push the star and end
this interval to it right right

246
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:40,000
this interval to it right right
 

247
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,430
this interval to it right right
and then look look eric here

248
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:43,440
and then look look eric here
 

249
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,629
and then look look eric here
all right yeah one three point four

250
00:05:46,629 --> 00:05:46,639
all right yeah one three point four
 

251
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,469
all right yeah one three point four
what's the interval between what's the

252
00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:48,479
what's the interval between what's the
 

253
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,230
what's the interval between what's the
intersection between these two

254
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:50,240
intersection between these two
 

255
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,950
intersection between these two
one three one three okay one three then

256
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:52,960
one three one three okay one three then
 

257
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,270
one three one three okay one three then
we we know we have an answer one three

258
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:55,280
we we know we have an answer one three
 

259
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,870
we we know we have an answer one three
and should i move the which one

260
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:58,880
and should i move the which one
 

261
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,110
and should i move the which one
to now because look at this end we need

262
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:01,120
to now because look at this end we need
 

263
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,309
to now because look at this end we need
to check this end

264
00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:02,319
to check this end
 

265
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,629
to check this end
three three is smaller than four so we

266
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:04,639
three three is smaller than four so we
 

267
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,110
three three is smaller than four so we
move move the smaller end

268
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:07,120
move move the smaller end
 

269
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,150
move move the smaller end
next one right right got it

270
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:10,160
next one right right got it
 

271
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,670
next one right right got it
does it make sense

272
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:13,680

 

273
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,430

this ending point now we check the

274
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:15,440
this ending point now we check the
 

275
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,590
this ending point now we check the
ending point which is smaller

276
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:17,600
ending point which is smaller
 

277
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,390
ending point which is smaller
we move the smaller one doesn't make

278
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:20,400
we move the smaller one doesn't make
 

279
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:20,870
we move the smaller one doesn't make
sense

280
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:20,880
sense
 

281
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,430
sense
oh yeah yeah why we can't move the

282
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:23,440
oh yeah yeah why we can't move the
 

283
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,189
oh yeah yeah why we can't move the
bigger one because the bigger one

284
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:25,199
bigger one because the bigger one
 

285
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,110
bigger one because the bigger one
we don't want to check we want to just

286
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:27,120
we don't want to check we want to just
 

287
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,790
we don't want to check we want to just
move the smaller one to check next one

288
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:28,800
move the smaller one to check next one
 

289
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,430
move the smaller one to check next one
is

290
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:29,440
is
 

291
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,590
is
spear smaller than this one right so we

292
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:31,600
spear smaller than this one right so we
 

293
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,870
spear smaller than this one right so we
need to move this one here

294
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:32,880
need to move this one here
 

295
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,150
need to move this one here
five six and one four yeah

296
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:36,160
five six and one four yeah
 

297
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,070
five six and one four yeah
one one four and five six doesn't have

298
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:38,080
one one four and five six doesn't have
 

299
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,909
one one four and five six doesn't have
an intersection no right

300
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:39,919
an intersection no right
 

301
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,309
an intersection no right
no now which one is big the end point is

302
00:06:42,309 --> 00:06:42,319
no now which one is big the end point is
 

303
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,710
no now which one is big the end point is
bigger four and six which one is bigger

304
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:44,720
bigger four and six which one is bigger
 

305
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,510
bigger four and six which one is bigger
four nine six now we move this bit yeah

306
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:47,520
four nine six now we move this bit yeah
 

307
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,469
four nine six now we move this bit yeah
yeah

308
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:48,479
yeah
 

309
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,070
yeah
okay five six on five seven five six

310
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,080
okay five six on five seven five six
 

311
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,830
okay five six on five seven five six
five six we push the result five six

312
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:53,840
five six we push the result five six
 

313
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,189
five six we push the result five six
here and six and seven which is smaller

314
00:06:57,189 --> 00:06:57,199
here and six and seven which is smaller
 

315
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,070
here and six and seven which is smaller
six six now we'll move here yeah seven

316
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:00,080
six six now we'll move here yeah seven
 

317
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,189
six six now we'll move here yeah seven
nine and five seven

318
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:03,199
nine and five seven
 

319
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,430
nine and five seven
seven seven seven and then we move to

320
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:05,440
seven seven seven and then we move to
 

321
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,950
seven seven seven and then we move to
the end okay so you see we got the

322
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:06,960
the end okay so you see we got the
 

323
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,150
the end okay so you see we got the
intersection yeah

324
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:08,160
intersection yeah
 

325
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:27,350
intersection yeah
gonna make sense okay so let's try this

326
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:27,360

 

327
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,430

that's a b colon

328
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:31,440
that's a b colon
 

329
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,510
that's a b colon
okay then the lens okay let's say the

330
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:33,520
okay then the lens okay let's say the
 

331
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,670
okay then the lens okay let's say the
answer answer equals at least

332
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:35,680
answer answer equals at least
 

333
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,790
answer answer equals at least
at the beginning at least okay at least

334
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:38,800
at the beginning at least okay at least
 

335
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,990
at the beginning at least okay at least
yeah and how can we lead next

336
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:44,000
yeah and how can we lead next
 

337
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,110
yeah and how can we lead next
what do we know we have two pointer i

338
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:47,120
what do we know we have two pointer i
 

339
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,869
what do we know we have two pointer i
equals z equals one i equals z equals

340
00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:50,879
equals z equals one i equals z equals
 

341
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:51,350
equals z equals one i equals z equals
one

342
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:51,360
one
 

343
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,550

i equal equals

344
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:54,560
i equal equals
 

345
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,309
i equal equals
at the beginning of the index the first

346
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:56,319
at the beginning of the index the first
 

347
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,070
at the beginning of the index the first
index is one

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,830
zero zero yeah okay
okay then why are i smaller than

352
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:05,840
okay then why are i smaller than
 

353
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,830
okay then why are i smaller than
lens a and

okay now we need to check the end part

374

okay now we need to check the end part

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,070
okay now we need to check the end part
yeah if

383
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,870
if if a i1 is smaller than bj1 we need
to increment i or j
