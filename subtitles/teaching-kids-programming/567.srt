1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,960
hello hello Mr Runner right okay so

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,840
today let's look at the numbers yeah so

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,760
okay so just imagine a number like

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,340
you know just give me a number random

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:17,100
positive integer and a million can you

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:22,800
leave a smaller one positive integer one

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,800
how about one positive okay

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,300
37 yeah

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:31,520
can you think of a number which is less

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:34,620
than twenty one one

11
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:37,200
is easy right it's a special case which

12
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:41,280
I'm going to talk about in a few how

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:44,280
about 16 16 okay yeah 16.

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,160
okay so imagine I have a empty board

15
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:51,000
okay so 16 I put it there

16
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:54,719
okay now can you find out all the

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,059
numbers bigger than one inclusive like a

18
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,640
smaller than and smaller than this

19
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:02,879
number 16 right

20
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:07,320
so can you find any number any number so

21
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:09,780
from 1 to 16 let 16 modulus a equal

22
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,780
equal one

23
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:15,840
you know 16 divided by a the modulus

24
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:19,260
equal equal one 16 divided by one

25
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,840
remaining zero zero okay so this is

26
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:23,700
yellow close up oh it's three and five

27
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,299
five okay so you've got three and five

28
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:30,299
right anything else fifteen fifteen yeah

29
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:32,580
anything well no right three times okay

30
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:35,100
three times

31
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:37,020
yeah I know so three five fifteen three

32
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,780
five fifteen once we put down the

33
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:43,259
numbers on this y box right it stays

34
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,479
there so every number here three you did

35
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:46,159
the same yeah just two right so for the

36
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:50,579
two

37
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:55,079
five four four and

38
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:56,820
two is there right yeah fifteen two

39
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:58,740
it's there

40
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,479
um fourteen

41
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:04,520
seven

42
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:07,619
okay what is 15. um six

43
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:09,840
fifteen divided by six the remaining

44
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:12,300
around seven seven okay seven six yeah

45
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,420
okay so after

46
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,800
a billion tons

47
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:19,140
thirteen ten to the power of nine a

48
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,150
billion what is that opinion

49
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,700
13.

50
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:25,680
[Music]

51
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:27,720
13. I know what I'm saying is repeated

52
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,420
obedient sounds how many numbers how

53
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,640
many testing numbers originally I put a

54
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:36,060
16 how many distinct numbers what does

55
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,340
that mean this thing unique

56
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:41,819
liquid opinion times

57
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:44,280
how many numbers are on here so I keep

58
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:47,580
doing this that's 13 and I'll be 12.

59
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:51,780
who have I noticed it

60
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:53,819
minus one yeah why because

61
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:56,700
why is it a matter of fact yeah a minus

62
00:02:53,819 --> 00:03:00,660
one is cleanser 20.

63
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:03,720
19 20. so what numbers are eventually

64
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:08,519
going to be there one is going to be 19

65
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:10,680
18 17. but if you don't count 16 and one

66
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:13,440
then you'll be 14. there's a special

67
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,340
cases originally if it's one if it's one

68
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,280
then

69
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:20,220
it's one if it doesn't have a ring

70
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,879
remainder one yeah because the thing is

71
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:26,700
I put it one there and I repeat

72
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:29,640
and I can't find anything that makes it

73
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:33,060
divided by it one right yeah and it

74
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:35,700
possesses but yeah but you you wouldn't

75
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:38,940
put but one down because they wouldn't

76
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:41,700
be within a remainder of one okay so the

77
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:43,500
step is I choose a number N I put it

78
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:46,620
there this is the starting location and

79
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:49,080
so I put the number in here

80
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,340
and number I find out all the numbers

81
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:54,120
that

82
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:57,000
all the numbers n divided by a if

83
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,459
modulus equal equal one okay follow

84
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,879
those numbers I put in there okay if it

85
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:06,599
is saying one I put one there and I

86
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:09,720
can't find anything like modulus equal

87
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:12,000
one then it ends

88
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:14,159
okay so what's the number so if I put

89
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,220
the number n what if I choose the number

90
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:19,620
and what's the answer a minus one but if

91
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:22,260
n equals one what's the answer one yeah

92
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,540
if n is one the answer is one if n is

93
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:28,560
other things the answer is M minus one

94
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:30,540
okay Y is n minus one because one yeah

95
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,820
but y eventually it's going to be a

96
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:34,919
minus one because you're gonna repeat a

97
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,540
billion times a billion times if n is

98
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:39,139
more than enough I'm going to repeat it

99
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:42,780
forever until no numbers no new numbers

100
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:44,520
or rival so why is it a minus one and

101
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:47,759
that's billion times eventually all of

102
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:51,320
them numbers in that range from one to

103
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,320
no one no way

104
00:04:57,139 --> 00:05:04,100
one isn't uh gonna be there because yeah

105
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:08,820
because your mother is

106
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:11,639
yellow yeah so from two to and all the

107
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:13,320
numbers so you have to think there but

108
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:16,620
you need to persuade the people right

109
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:19,979
why because if I put an end when n is

110
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:22,080
bigger than two right so I put a three

111
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:24,900
to prove it if the number n is three

112
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,240
what numbers can be put there so yeah

113
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:29,280
you know two four what numbers can we

114
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,380
put there three and two five what

115
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,380
numbers can be for that two three and

116
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:36,120
four four right

117
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:38,880
six what numbers can be put today it's

118
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,680
five that's five okay seven what numbers

119
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,060
can we put there

120
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,560
three

121
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,060
so he has six right

122
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:48,060
and two

123
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,060
okay

124
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,440
33.

125
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:08,840
okay how about

126
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:12,720
132 what numbers can we collect

127
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:16,460
I'm gonna ask you until you know you

128
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:19,639
know a trick to find the answer quickly

129
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:22,680
this is the even number

130
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:24,419
the answer is one three this number

131
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,520
you're you're for sure it's there right

132
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:30,020
okay another one

133
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,020
yes good job

134
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,039
thank you you'll get my phone yeah for

135
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:41,100
any number which is greater than two we

136
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:44,460
know for sure n minus one satisfied

137
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,600
right so mining number I can put n minus

138
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,180
one

139
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,819
the one yeah for two so we put a two

140
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:52,860
layer we can't take any number right but

141
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:55,800
the answer is s minus one which is one

142
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:58,740
number okay for three I can put a two

143
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,259
for a hundred I can put a 99 and then

144
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:04,319
for 99

145
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:08,280
yeah I know at 98 97. So eventually it

146
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:12,560
will come down to one two okay no one

147
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:15,900
come on another one yeah three one

148
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:18,900
okay so the answer is

149
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,900
oh

150
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:43,319
one this is one this is uh mathematics

151
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,120
and we can do this simulation yeah we

152
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:48,300
just repeat this process okay I'm going

153
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:51,599
to try this to simulate the process okay

154
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:53,639
we want to keep tracking of the unique

155
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,560
numbers what kind of data structure can

156
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:58,740
we use to keep tracking all the unique

157
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:02,460
numbers character dictionary

158
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:05,400
counter is a dictionary dictionary is

159
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:09,840
also headset right headset we find let's

160
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:14,780
define a process f n okay so we just

161
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,780
need to go through from I in range

162
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,860
we need to start from one no right no up

163
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:22,860
to n

164
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,860
right

165
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:33,479
and this number is not in this number is

166
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:37,620
not on the Y Bar that number is not in

167
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:40,680
numbers then what will do numbers dot

168
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:44,219
add we want to know this number I and

169
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:47,519
then for this number I we want to repeat

170
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:48,959
this process using the recursion okay

171
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,940
make sense

172
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:53,580
so what should I put here what should I

173
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:55,740
put here and then we just call this FN

174
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:58,560
and return the lens on the

175
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,700
length of the numbers

176
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,640
okay

177
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:06,420
for I I'm going from 2 to M minus 1

178
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:09,300
right if this number well and modulus it

179
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:11,899
equals one right if n log is I equal

180
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,899
equal one

181
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,800
right we found one number we want to put

182
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:18,540
it there but it's not in the Bible in

183
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,420
the number y box then we put this number

184
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:23,519
write it down one over the ten we know

185
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,779
that it's 9 we put the 9 on the ball and

186
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,240
what do we do

187
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:30,180
the next time we need to repeat the same

188
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:32,580
process right yeah so this is f n so

189
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:35,339
what should I do put here F1

190
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:37,620
this is nine I'm adding the number nine

191
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:39,620
to the white ball numbers this is

192
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:42,360
numbers

193
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:44,100
a and I want to count the number of

194
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,500
sides here right

195
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:49,070
I I yes

196
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,560
the time come next before this one is it

197
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:51,560
[Music]

198
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,560
um

199
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,760
what what's n

200
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:58,800
is it all

201
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:02,100
maximum time how many numbers the

202
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:06,180
maximum I can put down on the white box

203
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:10,680
and one is thing anyone needs one yeah

204
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:13,620
so he's Owen right yeah space complexity

205
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:15,480
space complexity do you think

206
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:17,940
how many numbers I can put on a

207
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:20,420
whiteboard the Whiteboard the whole

208
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,420
numbers

209
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:25,260
so oh and right we know we're not

210
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,300
talking about a constant okay yeah which

211
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:30,320
one is better this one this method or

212
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:32,700
the previous platform

213
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,740
because that one was the mathematics

214
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,720
mathematics this one is the simulation

215
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,899
we are just repeating the process we

216
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,600
want to count the number of the numbers

217
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:44,220
unique numbers using the hash set we put

218
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,380
all the numbers using the headset

219
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,290
installment unique numbers okay what

220
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:50,360
have you learned today

221
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:50,360
[Music]

222
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:56,779
we have this white wood and he's being

223
00:10:53,700 --> 00:11:01,260
given a number I mean

224
00:10:56,779 --> 00:11:03,540
you're you're adding numbers which

225
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:05,820
numbers on the Whiteboard which

226
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:08,760
which is the

227
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:10,200
the divisible with

228
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:13,880
um

229
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:16,019
which is divisible with remainder one

230
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:18,779
and so

231
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:19,800
and then we you repeat it a billion

232
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:21,000
times

233
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:25,019
and

234
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,579
and the solution is like uh we we get n

235
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:29,100
minus one

236
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:31,920
numbers eventually

237
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:34,860
yeah if we repeat this process forever

238
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:37,620
right until no new numbers I'll put on

239
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:40,860
the white bar okay the trick is that if

240
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:44,579
we put a n well n is uh greater than two

241
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:46,740
a minus one satisfied so for if we put M

242
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:49,440
minus sign we can put my M minus two and

243
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:51,360
if I put n minus 3 I can put n minus 3

244
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:55,380
and there two right so the number

245
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,519
between two to n inclusive is a minus

246
00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:00,300
one

247
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:03,200
yeah okay that's it for today bye-bye

248
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,200
bye bye
