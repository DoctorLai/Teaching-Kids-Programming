1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,400
hello mister we are all right mr ryan

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,160
are you right yeah

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,120
so what's dynamic programming we talked

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:12,000
about this a few times ago

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,640
talk uh dynamic programming

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,669
in one word in one word

7
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,669
[Music]

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,440
[Music]

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,600
it's

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,320
for remembering yeah remember we want to

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,120
remember the computer and the

12
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,920
computed result yeah so we don't want to

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:45,200
we calculate it over and over again

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,559
and specifically we can put the cache

15
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,079
the casting

16
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,640
above the

17
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,800
function the message so you ask the

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,039
computer to remember it yeah

19
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,640
to remember it okay

20
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,280
yeah let's uh

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,440
we have two kinds of dynamic programming

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,199
top down and bottom up depends on just

23
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,119
just think about the people matching

24
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:08,560
number your fibonacci number

25
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:12,240
now f n equals f n minus 1 plus s minus

26
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,479
2 right if we keep if we compute from fn

27
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,200
and then we need to fn uh n minus 1 and

28
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:19,600
minus 2 for n minus 1 we need n minus 2

29
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,880
and minus 3 right it's a tree right it's

30
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:26,320
a tree look if we want to compute fn i

31
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,439
now know become msn minus one and f n

32
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,640
minus two

33
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,960
and look

34
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,439
we only compute f m minus one we need

35
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,240
the f n minus two and

36
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,400
f and minus three right so look if we

37
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,400
want to compute this value

38
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,640
so we need two values

39
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,720
which is smaller and then if i want to

40
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,479
compute the n minus one i need a minus

41
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,560
one minus three so if we go in this way

42
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:52,240
let's stop down but if we're going from

43
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:55,680
that way if we start from f0 and f1 f2

44
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:58,560
let's bottom up right f top down

45
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,079
you can just say okay define f you can

46
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,439
say define

47
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:06,399
f n

48
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:09,119
and if if and equal equal 0 or n

49
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:11,280
equals 1 return n right

50
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:15,440
and otherwise i return

51
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,879
f n minus one plus f and minus two

52
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,560
okay

53
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,560
this is the top down top down

54
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,360
yeah i have your attention please yes

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,760
but this is

56
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,040
expensive why is that look

57
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,120
f and minus 2 here f m minus 2

58
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,440
right this could be a lot right look

59
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,319
it'll be f minus 3

60
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,239
f and minus four again look f n minus

61
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:43,920
three x minus three

62
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,720
it's expensive here f n minus three

63
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,440
yeah

64
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,280
and then f n minus four look how many

65
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,680
times i need to

66
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:55,120
at least over and over again but if i

67
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,760
magically put this here magically

68
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,440
and i just need to remember n value so

69
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,640
look the first time i kick your f n

70
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,879
minus two

71
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,879
i save it so next time

72
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,159
i won't continue this way because i

73
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,400
already know it

74
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,959
i already know it right

75
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:15,200
dynamic programming okay

76
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:18,560
so we have an array of numbers 1 5 11 5.

77
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,560
can you separate this array into two uh

78
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,840
subsequent okay remember the subsequent

79
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,840
and then the sum would be the same

80
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,599
do you understand the problem

81
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,959
this is

82
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,799
okay

83
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,360
and this one

84
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,360
subsequent

85
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,640
okay okay okay can you go back okay this

86
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,640
is not a dungeon

87
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,599
so look yes subsequent subsequence uh

88
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,040
subsequence and someplace what's the

89
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,200
difference between subsequent and

90
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:54,080
subless can you tell me what's the same

91
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,560
continuous and one of them is

92
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,959
okay the subsequence is not continuous

93
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,400
subsequence is that the original array

94
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,400
and we can okay

95
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:09,120
okay look listen to me not continuous

96
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,280
that's what i said okay subsequent not

97
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,360
continuous it's like the original array

98
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,599
and then you can remove zero or more

99
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,519
characters uh numbers right on it for

100
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,359
example one five eleven if i did it five

101
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,240
and five and the remaining would be one

102
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:24,240
eleven is a subsequence the sub this

103
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:28,400
is continuous right you pick remember

104
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,680
the cn1 cn2 right cn1 plus cn2

105
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,560
cn1

106
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,520
i have n elements i pick one

107
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,440
that

108
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,840
this is the number of way of picking one

109
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,800
out of n i have three apples

110
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,960
ryan

111
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,720
you want to pick one to eat how many

112
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,360
ways how many apples can you pick how

113
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,840
many different ways three exactly okay

114
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,320
so c and what makes me think

115
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,160
yeah cn1 is the meaning that the

116
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,400
subplace with only one single element

117
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,040
and cn2 is like you pick two index two

118
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,479
index 11 right now you pick these you

119
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,960
pick this

120
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:03,280
there are n elements you pick two

121
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,840
okay and then one five eleven this is

122
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,720
the service you pick this you pick this

123
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:11,199
five eleven five is a service okay so if

124
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:14,320
you do this that would be n times n plus

125
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:16,479
1 divided by 2 this is the number of the

126
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,080
total sub is continuous and that's the

127
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,960
in the scale if you want to prove first

128
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,960
it let's oh n square right but for some

129
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,880
subsequent

130
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,720
subsequent we can think it this way for

131
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,199
each number we can pick or not pick

132
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,479
right that gives us two choice for the

133
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:34,720
second element we can pick or not pick

134
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:38,160
give us another two choice so divide

135
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,840
into plus then or multiply

136
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,400
one question

137
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,639
multiply multiply and for the third one

138
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,120
i can i still have i can pick or not

139
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,560
pick so and i can multiply two so if

140
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,639
there are n elements what's the tongue

141
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,639
and brexit

142
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,000
you'll be something like level

143
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,319
yeah 2 to the power 1 is 2

144
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,160
2 to the power 1 is 2 and you know it's

145
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:10,479
very very stupid the graph

146
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,520
okay so um so if we want to prove

147
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:15,919
firstly right we can try

148
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,960
every subsequent we can generate

149
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,840
each subsequence and then for each one

150
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,120
yeah

151
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,800
we can get the sum of it

152
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,160
get the sum of it so

153
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,000
i know we can check if it's equals to

154
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,360
to what

155
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,960
t 0

156
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,400
the total sum look the total sum of

157
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,440
these is what

158
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,680
22 even okay so for the subsequence we

159
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,120
want to check the subsequent sum equals

160
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,680
to what

161
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,160
even to the equal number

162
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,840
yeah yep yeah yeah if it's even number

163
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,680
we can find that maybe we can find the

164
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,800
solution but if it's all number it's not

165
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:55,599
right if it is 23 or 5 there's no way to

166
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,639
split it into half right yeah

167
00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:00,720
okay but look okay guess 22 this is the

168
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,720
total sum for the array and i want to

169
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,919
change i want to find the subsequent sum

170
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,919
that equals to what

171
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,360
to what eleven eleven whatever half of

172
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,039
it yeah eleven halfway so that takes to

173
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,440
get the sum of the subsequent that takes

174
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:17,440
one time so all together that'll be o n

175
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,479
times 2 to the power of n

176
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,479
right

177
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,840
n times 2 to the power this is quite

178
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,080
slow okay

179
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,240
so

180
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:30,319
so we want to use the dynamic

181
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:32,720
programming to save it yeah because look

182
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,479
we can come up with a function okay

183
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,599
come up with a function

184
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,599
so basically

185
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,160
as we as we talked about

186
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,560
for the

187
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,960
solid x number for this number we can

188
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,360
have two choice pick or nothing right

189
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,680
and now we also have one dimension which

190
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,479
is the remaining sum so at the beginning

191
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,039
we give a half of it like 22 will give

192
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,800
11. and if we decide to pick the number

193
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:02,160
we substitute a number

194
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,080
from 11 right and if we are originally n

195
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,840
and then if any any time

196
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,479
we're reaching the end

197
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,560
so we can we can do what we need to try

198
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:13,520
it out but

199
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:17,120
if the sum is being reduced to zero okay

200
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,560
so let's first of all substitute some

201
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,120
subset sum

202
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:24,400
i know we have nums

203
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,560
and then let's say tota tells uh can can

204
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,599
i have your attention not too too loud

205
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,080
please

206
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:32,880
counter equal sum

207
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,399
nums okay that's o n right but that's

208
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,880
okay

209
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:39,200
this is some function we can we can use

210
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,919
the mathematic building function some

211
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,880
function okay oh we can do this and uh

212
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:47,200
total equals zero for i in lumps and

213
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:51,519
total plus equals i right this is the

214
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,519
same thing that's our ni that's owen

215
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,399
if

216
00:08:52,839 --> 00:09:00,800
total divided by 2

217
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,800
equal equal one yeah what does it mean

218
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,800
and now we need to return first can can

219
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,480
somebody explain to me what does this

220
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,120
mean

221
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,120
you want to check

222
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,080
yeah if it's all then there's no way to

223
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,880
split it into half right

224
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,800
or

225
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,200
module two

226
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,959
yeah or we can do this n one it's the

227
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,560
same thing modulated

228
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:25,600
0.2

229
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,440
okay now the half half would be

230
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,839
total

231
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,080
divided by 2. this is the sum okay let's

232
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,760
come up with a function define

233
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,680
dp

234
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,760
and now we are considering the ice

235
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,399
number from the left to the right okay

236
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,080
and now we are considering the sum

237
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:46,240
s right

238
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:49,040
look if i equal equal length

239
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,360
nums yeah we are running out of numbers

240
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,279
then we need to find out if the sum has

241
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,880
reduced to zero right

242
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,160
yeah yes

243
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,519
make sense

244
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,600
what did i just say

245
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,000
we we're checking if

246
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,839
the number reduced to zero and what

247
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,079
cases we need to do find if it's even

248
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,000
i don't know if i

249
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:12,480
that we're considering the numbers here

250
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,480
numbers

251
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:18,959
from left to zero index right index i

252
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:22,240
index i i index i i equals zero the

253
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:23,839
first number i equals length n

254
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,839
we are now at this point we are running

255
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,079
out of numbers if we are running our

256
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,880
number we need to check if the s the sum

257
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:33,440
has been reduced to zero okay

258
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:36,160
otherwise we can just do what i look at

259
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,920
any point if the s is reduced to is

260
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,200
below zero what does it mean what should

261
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,000
we return here

262
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,440
we will if the sum has been reduced to

263
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,959
zero

264
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,800
become negative

265
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:51,200
so what's your return 12 hours here

266
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,640
come on think about it

267
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,720
why is it true

268
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,959
because it's even

269
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,279
no no no i mean then something

270
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:02,640
false yes

271
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:05,279
if it falls below zero it means right we

272
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,120
are using too much sun right so in this

273
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,279
case it's not

274
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,240
this is not

275
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,839
not a way to separate to split the array

276
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,040
into half okay

277
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:19,760
then now i just need to do what return

278
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,360
dp if i pick the choice if i pick a

279
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,800
number okay look

280
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:28,560
i plus one and then s minus what nums i

281
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:31,680
right if i pick this number

282
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:34,240
or if i don't pick it d p y can you tell

283
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:37,440
me if i don't pick it what happened

284
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,440
if you don't figure it

285
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,180
what's the first parameter if i don't

286
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,559
pick it

287
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:44,559
[Music]

288
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,519
here i'm here

289
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,760
if i this number i don't pick so what

290
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,639
happen i should move to the next

291
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,440
so i

292
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:03,920
i plus one and then what's the thumb if

293
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,440
i don't take it

294
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,959
what what's the sound

295
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,560
if you don't know pick us

296
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,079
if i pick it i need to subtract if i

297
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,360
don't pick it what happen

298
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:17,360
you need to

299
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:20,160
be the same be the same so s

300
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,160
what's missing here

301
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:27,040
if i don't pick cash

302
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:29,040
if i don't pay cash yeah

303
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,720
there will be multiple times this

304
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,800
intermediate value being calculated

305
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,720
again again but if i

306
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:38,399
put the cash what's the what's the time

307
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:40,560
complexity if i put the cash

308
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:44,240
look at s baby

309
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,839
i i is the what then some length of the

310
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,839
numbers right

311
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:52,880
name s s is half total so okay let's say

312
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:57,040
half the total sum right so some

313
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:59,120
some let's say sum is s s times n okay

314
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,279
the time complexes o

315
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,880
s times n divided by 2 and we drop the

316
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:05,440
constant right because this is the total

317
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,440
sum we are looking for a half half of it

318
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,639
s times n

319
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,079
right

320
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,680
so look this is the total number of the

321
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:16,160
maximum

322
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,800
values we can catch right we can catch

323
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,639
and that also means the time complexity

324
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,480
right so look

325
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,839
make sense yeah

326
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,480
for this number

327
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,720
for i'm standing at this point for i'm

328
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,480
still looking at the ice number for this

329
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,680
number i can pick it

330
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,639
i can pick it yeah uh or i don't pick it

331
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,880
here

332
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,760
in both ways we need to move to the next

333
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,920
number and when we reach the end

334
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,560
when we reach end we have to check if

335
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:47,839
the sum is zero if we reduce the zero

336
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:51,360
then that's a good

337
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:53,839
okay and any at any point right if the

338
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,959
sum already falls below zero so we don't

339
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,800
pick

340
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,880
right

341
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,279
make sense

342
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,519
yeah so okay by the way these numbers

343
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:06,160
are non-negative okay

344
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,839
yeah yeah no negatives not about decimal

345
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,760
things

346
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,000
no decimal

347
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,000
not decimal just just positive integers

348
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,680
okay

349
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,040
