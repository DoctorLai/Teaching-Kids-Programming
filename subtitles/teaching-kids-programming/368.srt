1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,199
hello

2
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:05,600
hello

3
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:06,560
hello mr mr wine i alright

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,440
yeah

5
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,840
okay so today uh we're going to find the

6
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,400
minimum difference absolute difference

7
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:18,000
in our way okay so let's say

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,119
mean difference mean abs was abs

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,320
difference

10
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:25,039
of of two numbers

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,359
two numbers in a relay

12
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,560
so let's say three

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,199
four

14
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,680
a hundred

15
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,920
20 30.

16
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,600
what's if we pick we are about to pick

17
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,200
two numbers what's the minimum

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,120
difference

19
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,680
yeah yeah the minimum difference minimum

20
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,399
has a little difference yeah one okay

21
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,520
okay so now if i have another one here

22
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:52,079
which is the 19 okay so you need to tell

23
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,840
me that the minimum

24
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,520
difference is

25
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,280
three four and then it's a pair

26
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:02,160
increasing and another one 1920

27
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,000
1920.

28
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,600
so you need to tell me okay this answer

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,920
is that okay so 30 100

30
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,439
yeah we so find the minimum yeah find a

31
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,560
minimum pair

32
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,960
of

33
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,799
of numbers that have the

34
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,119
absolute difference which is the

35
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:25,360
smallest and then we output the

36
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,880
pair in ascending order okay

37
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,360
yeah

38
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,320
and then and one number can only be used

39
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,040
uh

40
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:36,320
it can can be used twice i think right

41
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,119
look if i have one another 21 here

42
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,880
right

43
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,119
if i have another one side here you can

44
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,960
you need to tell me okay

45
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,680
another one 21.

46
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,880
so look even the 20 appears only once

47
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,119
right even appear up here once we still

48
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,119
need to output it yeah

49
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,600
make sense

50
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:58,479
okay so this task right what what's your

51
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,520
approach what's your idea i mean

52
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,200
sorting

53
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,320
something forward

54
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,320
okay good idea so but to do this

55
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,399
to do this we need to separate into two

56
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,640
steps right first of all

57
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,720
first of all what first of all find the

58
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,239
minimum difference which is one yeah

59
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,959
first of all you need to tell me okay

60
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:20,080
it's one the difference is the minimum

61
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:23,360
difference is one yeah well what if

62
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,360
if there's like two two um does this

63
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,120
count like there's two notes we're

64
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,280
saying and

65
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,280
then

66
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,720
that's that's a good question yes yes

67
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,640
obviously if that duplicate numbers like

68
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,000
the difference is you know you find a

69
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,599
duplicate number right yeah okay

70
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,599
so first of all we find the minimum

71
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,640
difference and then we go through the

72
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,599
array

73
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,160
again and we output the pair okay so for

74
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,400
the first for this one how do you you

75
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,360
said blue first you said uh

76
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,040
salty okay for the proof of thing

77
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,040
layer

78
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,159
and elements in a way what's proof

79
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,159
what's the term complexity

80
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,959
yes look

81
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,760
what's going for thing for i

82
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,080
okay for i in range and for j

83
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,120
yeah so for i

84
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,200
in

85
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,280
range and right

86
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,480
for j

87
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,920
in

88
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:24,640
range yeah range up to i right and then

89
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,959
we have a player j i right

90
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,599
then we just have to say okay

91
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,360
uh if that we first of all find the

92
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,440
minimum difference okay the difference

93
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,360
let's say at the beginning the biggest

94
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,080
number we can think of is infinity and

95
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,440
massive infinity then we can say i can

96
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,400
think of

97
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,799
a bigger number infinity and one

98
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,200
infinity is a it's not

99
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,519
it's not a concrete

100
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,000
concept it's a concept yeah yeah that's

101
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,760
what i said it's this this thing this

102
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,480
thing

103
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,480
infinity yeah

104
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,920
infinity so there is

105
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:04,879
actually not beyond the infinity because

106
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,280
infinity is it's not a concrete number

107
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:11,200
it's it's like you know so big you

108
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:13,760
cannot even locate it right okay for i

109
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,000
in range and for j and i and then this

110
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,840
difference yeah mean difference

111
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,759
mean difference

112
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,120
equals mean

113
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,040
difference

114
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,040
okay so the absolute difference we use

115
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:30,160
the abs yeah abs numbers i minus num j

116
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,720
right what's abs from here i talk about

117
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,479
this all the time

118
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,440
yeah and then now i got a mean

119
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,000
difference

120
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,040
look this is n and that's one square

121
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,690
right

122
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,520
okay what's abs

123
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:46,800
[Music]

124
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:49,040
is absolute value okay when it's when x

125
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,639
is bigger than zero is x when x is

126
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,639
smaller than zero what does it return

127
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,880
value this is

128
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:02,899
[Music]

129
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,440
it's just the distance to the x to the

130
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,680
zero okay

131
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,680
yeah absolutely

132
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,160
so this is o n square

133
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,639
and we sort it if we sort it how do we

134
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,840
do it look if we started look we saw

135
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,479
this number

136
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,800
so the mean difference would be

137
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:27,600
in what if i saw this number what's

138
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,800
after sorting yeah i i please say

139
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,400
up if i do this ar out. what's the time

140
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,560
complexity

141
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,240
what's the time convex before this one

142
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,400
very light what's the time breaking for

143
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,400
this one

144
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,720
19

145
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:56,000
20 21 22.

146
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,520
100. okay so now if i sort it how can i

147
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,960
get the minimum difference where are

148
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,919
they

149
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,919
the meaning is different

150
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,479
look if i sort it so what why is the

151
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:11,680
resulting mean the arrays because

152
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:14,000
because because you because when they're

153
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,880
close to each other they're the most

154
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,759
near to each other and the other numbers

155
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,960
are yes we're done why we sort it

156
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,479
because sorting then we can just

157
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,720
calculate this difference that would be

158
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,800
that closes right there's no point to

159
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,960
calculate the difference like right

160
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,440
let's look that's different 16. it's

161
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:34,000
certainly smaller than a bigger than d2

162
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,400
right so i just have to calculate these

163
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,280
different right in all intent right

164
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,680
yeah

165
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,560
so i can just do this this

166
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,639
equal okay again minimum

167
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,759
infinity yeah and i'm gonna do this for

168
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,400
i

169
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,400
invent

170
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,199
one to n right and it's the length of

171
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,759
the

172
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,319
array and then look f

173
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,639
equals mean

174
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,639
this

175
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,440
nouns

176
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,160
i

177
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:10,479
what numbs i here i start from here i do

178
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,479
what eric can you can you complete this

179
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:17,520
noun is i and what what

180
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,479
yeah minus i minus one

181
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,800
okay

182
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:25,280
look sorting o and again this one o n so

183
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,639
overall the time complexity is what come

184
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,039
on

185
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,039
come on

186
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:58,400
first of all i saw this one second of

187
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,319
all i go through this linear time yeah

188
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,160
so if i put it together it's always

189
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:05,120
logan plus n

190
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:07,919
but o n of n is bigger than o l right

191
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,759
yeah so we keep the most dominating

192
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,759
power which is o and okay so we drop

193
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,599
this point okay so once we got this

194
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,520
difference now we need to go through

195
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,120
this array again right

196
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,120
yeah those are these array again and

197
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,360
then if the difference is equals the

198
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,520
mean difference i added right look after

199
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,759
this the difference would be equals to

200
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,160
one right equals one and that goes

201
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:30,080
through this okay alright

202
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,399
the difference is one okay so i put that

203
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,000
array three four

204
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,279
this one no

205
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,560
this one

206
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,880
okay

207
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,800
so 19 20.

208
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,360
this one

209
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,360
yes or no

210
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,920
okay no okay

211
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,279
okay so actually it's o n log n plus n

212
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,560
plus n

213
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:56,240
yeah

214
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,680
oh log n plus 2n we drop this

215
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,640
yeah make sense

216
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,680
yeah

217
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,680
which one is better

218
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,959
o and

219
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:10,000
log n the second approaches first of all

220
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,000
o n square

221
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,800
yeah the first one again because we get

222
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,720
the difference i want o n square and we

223
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,160
need to go through that

224
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,720
the same

225
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,480
process again and then to check if the

226
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,240
difference yeah if the difference

227
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,120
between any pair

228
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,920
is the smallest difference then we apply

229
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,839
it to the result right make sense

230
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,880
yeah so this one is currently better

231
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,800
yeah

232
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,120
yeah there's a huge difference yeah if

233
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,120
the angle is very large yeah o n square

234
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,279
could be like that yeah

235
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,519
and then our o and again could be like

236
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,360
that yeah you see

237
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,320
yeah

238
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,480
yeah

239
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,040
uh

240
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:56,000
actually no this is o log n

241
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:58,560
o n organs is is this is o n

242
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,120
o n log n is somewhere here

243
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,320
yeah because it's up is bigger than o n

244
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,240
right

245
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,839
it's bigger than one but smaller than

246
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,120
one square right

247
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:12,240
l is n squared this is o and log n

248
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:16,959
this is n right o n is leasing

249
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:19,839
make sense o n when when n is a hundred

250
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,360
this is 100 it's it's a triangle yeah

251
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,279
it's a what's what do you call this

252
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,000
triangular this side equals this side

253
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:27,040
this is the right angle

254
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,160
triangle

255
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,760
right angle triangle i don't know

256
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,240
you know what i mean this is the right

257
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,760
angle 90 degree and then this side is

258
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,320
equal to this side

259
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,000
yeah so if this side equals this side

260
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,440
what's the degree here

261
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,480
okay one question you probably don't

262
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,880
know right

263
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,880
okay so if this side equal this side

264
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,040
this side 90 degrees what's the degree

265
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,240
of here

266
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,959
this is

267
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,800
mathematics geometric

268
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:58,959
what's the what's these two three angles

269
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:01,440
like a plus b plus c what's this

270
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:03,600
how much anger is this the end of the

271
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,560
triangle internal angle

272
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,920
sorry

273
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:10,000
no no this is 90 degree yeah how much

274
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,519
the triangle any triangle what's the

275
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,440
triangle

276
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,160
what what's the

277
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,160
180 yeah we're done okay

278
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,120
we're done 45 you know how do you get

279
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,160
the 45 this is not eight nine this is 90

280
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:26,079
degree

281
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:29,360
so a plus b equals 90 degree right

282
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,959
yeah but because ac equals bc what does

283
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,839
it mean it means these two angles are

284
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:37,839
equal right yeah so these two languages

285
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:40,320
you can say 2a equals 90 so a equals 45

286
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:43,760
of course b equals 45. that's how we get

287
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,519
it yeah yeah okay make sense

288
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:50,040
yeah

289
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:50,040
okay that's it for today good job bye
