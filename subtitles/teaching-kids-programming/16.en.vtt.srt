about this bfs yes
this is jumping game okay

10
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:13,599
this is jumping game okay
 

11
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,950
this is jumping game okay
so let me just review it let us review

12
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:16,960
so let me just review it let us review
 

13
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,430
so let me just review it let us review
this

14
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:17,440
this
 

15
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,510
this
a little bit so

16
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:21,520
a little bit so
 

17
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,750
a little bit so
we have look we have a list of numbers

18
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:25,760
we have look we have a list of numbers
 

19
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,790
we have look we have a list of numbers
yes one

20
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:26,800
yes one
 

21
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,710
yes one
zero two 2

22
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:30,720
zero two 2
 

23
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,310
zero two 2
1 4

24
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:34,320

 

25
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,590

okay and then possibly let's do it um

26
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:39,600

 

27
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,950

yeah let's do it one here okay

28
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:42,960
yeah let's do it one here okay
 

29
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:49,190
yeah let's do it one here okay
so if if we start at this position

30
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:49,200
so if if we start at this position
 

31
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,310
so if if we start at this position
look yeah we can go this way two two

32
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:52,320
look yeah we can go this way two two
 

33
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,189
look yeah we can go this way two two
step

34
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:53,199
step
 

35
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,830
step
we can go backward two step

36
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:56,840

 

37
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,349

okay so

38
00:00:59,349 --> 00:00:59,359
okay so
 

39
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,709
okay so
one way of jumping to this zero is

40
00:01:02,709 --> 00:01:02,719
one way of jumping to this zero is
 

41
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,990
one way of jumping to this zero is
alright look at me

42
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:06,000

 

43
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,350

look is

44
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:09,360
look is
 

45
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,630
look is
to here

46
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:12,640

 

47
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,270

and i go back to these and go back to

48
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:15,280
and i go back to these and go back to
 

49
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:15,910
and i go back to these and go back to
two

50
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:15,920
two
 

51
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,350
two
then here or you can do this too

52
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:19,360
then here or you can do this too
 

53
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,469
then here or you can do this too
many ways here and and then jumping one

54
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:22,479
many ways here and and then jumping one
 

55
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:23,910
many ways here and and then jumping one
here right

56
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:23,920
here right
 

57
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,149
here right
yes so remember this bfs

58
00:01:28,149 --> 00:01:28,159
yes so remember this bfs
 

59
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,190
yes so remember this bfs
we search the tree for if we are at the

60
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:31,200
we search the tree for if we are at the
 

61
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,390
we search the tree for if we are at the
two right we are at this position too

62
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:34,400
two right we are at this position too
 

63
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,469
two right we are at this position too
so now i can go to this partition

64
00:01:38,469 --> 00:01:38,479
so now i can go to this partition
 

65
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,710
so now i can go to this partition
which is to the one or go to

66
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:42,720
which is to the one or go to
 

67
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,910
which is to the one or go to
this position this other one yeah

68
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:45,920
this position this other one yeah
 

69
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,630
this position this other one yeah
so this is the left one that's the right

70
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:48,640
so this is the left one that's the right
 

71
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,030
so this is the left one that's the right
one

72
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:49,040
one
 

73
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,990
one
that's right i'm just learning about the

74
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:52,000
that's right i'm just learning about the
 

75
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,870
that's right i'm just learning about the
bfs

76
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:52,880
bfs
 

77
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,510
bfs
no i'm just i i will introduce the

78
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:55,520
no i'm just i i will introduce the
 

79
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,310
no i'm just i i will introduce the
another

80
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:56,320
another
 

81
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,749
another
concept later left one okay and then now

82
00:01:59,749 --> 00:01:59,759
concept later left one okay and then now
 

83
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,270
concept later left one okay and then now
if it's left one and then i can do this

84
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:03,280
if it's left one and then i can do this
 

85
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,789
if it's left one and then i can do this
yeah which is yellow or list which is

86
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:06,799
yeah which is yellow or list which is
 

87
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,309
yeah which is yellow or list which is
left one yeah you see so so the point is

88
00:02:10,309 --> 00:02:10,319
left one yeah you see so so the point is
 

89
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:10,710
left one yeah you see so so the point is
that

90
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:10,720
that
 

91
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,309
that
every one every time i take a level i

92
00:02:14,309 --> 00:02:14,319
every one every time i take a level i
 

93
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:14,710
every one every time i take a level i
take

94
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:14,720
take

pay attention
two then i can go to one

146
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:33,120
two then i can go to one
 

147
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,350
two then i can go to one
and then i search these to two again

148
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:37,360
and then i search these to two again
 

149
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,390
and then i search these to two again
and then two you see so it's

150
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:40,400
and then two you see so it's
 

151
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,550
and then two you see so it's
the different search is that i pick a

152
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:42,560
the different search is that i pick a
 

153
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,509
the different search is that i pick a
path

154
00:03:43,509 --> 00:03:43,519
path
 

155
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,470
path
yeah and then i go as long as far as i

156
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:46,480
yeah and then i go as long as far as i
 

157
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,750
yeah and then i go as long as far as i
can right

00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:54,480
so so let's let's do it in
 

163
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,789
so so let's let's do it in
code okay so how do we do it

164
00:03:58,789 --> 00:03:58,799
code okay so how do we do it
 

165
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:14,750
code okay so how do we do it
how

166
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:14,760

172
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:28,560
and stuff on the list this is the least
 

173
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,550
and stuff on the list this is the least
this is the map we have the list

174
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:30,560
this is the map we have the list
 

175
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,950
this is the map we have the list
the numbers we're talking about the

176
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:32,960
the numbers we're talking about the
 

177
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,110
the numbers we're talking about the
numbers

178
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:35,120
numbers
 

179
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,150
numbers
and s is the starting point right

180
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:38,160
and s is the starting point right
 

181
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,150
and s is the starting point right
so now we first of all we need to check

182
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,160
so now we first of all we need to check
 

183
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,150
so now we first of all we need to check
if the starting point is zero

184
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:42,160
if the starting point is zero
 

185
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,350
if the starting point is zero
then we say if the starting point

186
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:45,360
then we say if the starting point
 

187
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,310
then we say if the starting point
here is already zero it means we have

188
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:48,320
here is already zero it means we have
 

189
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,310
here is already zero it means we have
reached the destination right

190
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:50,320
reached the destination right
 

191
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,510
reached the destination right
so what what should we do now we return

192
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:53,520
so what what should we do now we return
 

193
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,550
so what what should we do now we return
can you guess here written what

194
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:58,560

 

195
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,830

because we already visited it right

196
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:01,840
because we already visited it right
 

197
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,510
because we already visited it right
okay so now if i'm at this position as

198
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:05,520
okay so now if i'm at this position as
 

199
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,710
okay so now if i'm at this position as
so how many choices can i do no no no

200
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:08,720
so how many choices can i do no no no
 

201
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,430
so how many choices can i do no no no
how many choices do i have

202
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:11,440
how many choices do i have
 

203
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,230
how many choices do i have
if i'm at one position how many choice

204
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:14,240
if i'm at one position how many choice
 

205
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,029
if i'm at one position how many choice
do i have

206
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:15,039
do i have
 

207
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,270
do i have
two two yeah because i'm jumping forward

208
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:17,280
two two yeah because i'm jumping forward
 

209
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,629
two two yeah because i'm jumping forward
or backward right

210
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:18,639
or backward right
 

211
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,070
or backward right
so now two choice so f4 i

212
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:22,080
so now two choice so f4 i
 

213
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,749
so now two choice so f4 i
in minus one one that's a list

214
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:25,759
in minus one one that's a list
 

215
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,870
in minus one one that's a list
minus one false not yet

216
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:28,880
minus one false not yet
 

217
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,270
minus one false not yet
minus one is jumping backward one is

218
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:31,280
minus one is jumping backward one is
 

219
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,150
minus one is jumping backward one is
jumping forward

220
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:32,160
jumping forward
 

221
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,590
jumping forward
then now we need to check we need to

222
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:35,600
then now we need to check we need to
 

223
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:35,990
then now we need to check we need to
check

224
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,000
check
 

225
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,230
check
if the partition has uh we need to

226
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:38,240
if the partition has uh we need to
 

227
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,629
if the partition has uh we need to
calculate the next position right next

228
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:40,639
calculate the next position right next
 

229
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,909
calculate the next position right next
will be equals s right currently is

230
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:43,919
will be equals s right currently is
 

231
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,590
will be equals s right currently is
s plus i

232
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:47,600
s plus i
 

233
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,110
s plus i
times n s right

234
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:51,120
times n s right
 

235
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,590
times n s right
yeah so what does this mean this means

236
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:53,600
yeah so what does this mean this means
 

237
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,150
yeah so what does this mean this means
that i'm

238
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:54,160
that i'm
 

239
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,990
that i'm
at this position and if this number is

240
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:56,000
at this position and if this number is
 

241
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,909
at this position and if this number is
one then n

242
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:57,919
one then n
 

243
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,029
one then n
square bracket s is one and then minus

244
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:01,039
square bracket s is one and then minus
 

245
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,629
square bracket s is one and then minus
one or times one

246
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:02,639
one or times one
 

247
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,629
one or times one
plus s now currently i will put this

248
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:04,639
plus s now currently i will put this
 

249
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:05,670
plus s now currently i will put this
position right

250
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:05,680
position right
 

251
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,309
position right
now we need to check if this position is

252
00:06:08,309 --> 00:06:08,319
now we need to check if this position is
 

253
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,150
now we need to check if this position is
within the boundary

254
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:10,160
within the boundary
 

255
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,350
within the boundary
yeah if

256
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:13,360
yeah if
 

257
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,469
yeah if
next bigger than zero or

258
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:16,479
next bigger than zero or
 

259
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,710
next bigger than zero or
bigger equal than zero and next

260
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:20,720
bigger equal than zero and next
 

261
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,230
bigger equal than zero and next
smaller or equal the length

262
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:24,240
smaller or equal the length
 

263
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,430
smaller or equal the length
length and right not smaller than lens

264
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:27,440
length and right not smaller than lens
 

265
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,469
length and right not smaller than lens
you can't jump off out of the boundary

266
00:06:30,469 --> 00:06:30,479
you can't jump off out of the boundary
 

267
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,150
you can't jump off out of the boundary
also we need to make sure the position

268
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:34,160
also we need to make sure the position
 

269
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,870
also we need to make sure the position
has not been visited before right so we

270
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:36,880
has not been visited before right so we
 

271
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,629
has not been visited before right so we
we can do this by passing a

272
00:06:40,629 --> 00:06:40,639
we can do this by passing a
 

273
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,390
we can do this by passing a
notebook function right a notebook

274
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:42,400
notebook function right a notebook
 

275
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,070
notebook function right a notebook
dictionary which it will be

276
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,080
dictionary which it will be
 

277
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,189
dictionary which it will be
let's call it notebook and then that's

278
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:47,199
let's call it notebook and then that's
 

279
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,469
let's call it notebook and then that's
using a set right and then the column

280
00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:50,479
using a set right and then the column
 

281
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:50,870
using a set right and then the column
here

282
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:50,880
here
 

283
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,710
here
so now and if this next position

284
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:54,720
so now and if this next position
 

285
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,150
so now and if this next position
is not in not in notebook

286
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:58,160
is not in not in notebook
 

287
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,790
is not in not in notebook
so it means we haven't visited the

288
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:00,800
so it means we haven't visited the
 

289
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,189
so it means we haven't visited the
partition before then what we do

290
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:03,199
partition before then what we do
 

291
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,270
partition before then what we do
we first of all we add a petition into

292
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:05,280
we first of all we add a petition into
 

293
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,749
we first of all we add a petition into
the notebook right so notebook

294
00:07:07,749 --> 00:07:07,759
the notebook right so notebook
 

295
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:13,189
the notebook right so notebook
dot add next

296
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:13,199

 

297
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,550

now okay so now we we have the

298
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:16,560
now okay so now we we have the
 

299
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,670
now okay so now we we have the
blue no no no

300
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:19,680
blue no no no
 

301
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,749
blue no no no
do you still remember the question yeah

302
00:07:21,749 --> 00:07:21,759
do you still remember the question yeah
 

303
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,830
do you still remember the question yeah
calling itself so now we need to call

304
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:23,840
calling itself so now we need to call
 

305
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,990
calling itself so now we need to call
the function very very very good

306
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:28,000
the function very very very good
 

307
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,909
the function very very very good
if dfs recording this function and

308
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:31,919
if dfs recording this function and
 

309
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,230
if dfs recording this function and
what should i be passing here next

310
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:34,240
what should i be passing here next
 

311
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,510
what should i be passing here next
position is

312
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:37,520

 

313
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,629

s now s is current partition what's the

314
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:40,639
s now s is current partition what's the
 

315
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,110
s now s is current partition what's the
next position

316
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:43,120
next position
 

317
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,230
next position
uh i now what's the

318
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:46,240
uh i now what's the
 

319
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,350
uh i now what's the
next next partition next right s

320
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:49,360
next next partition next right s
 

321
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,550
next next partition next right s
at i times n so next i pass on the next

322
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:52,560
at i times n so next i pass on the next
 

323
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,110
at i times n so next i pass on the next
and then what in the notebook if this

324
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:55,120
and then what in the notebook if this
 

325
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,189
and then what in the notebook if this
function return true then i return to

326
00:07:57,189 --> 00:07:57,199
function return true then i return to
 

327
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,710
function return true then i return to
right

328
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:58,720
right
 

329
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,150
right
return two okay

330
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:02,160
return two okay
 

331
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,790
return two okay
if this returns now remember we need to

332
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:04,800
if this returns now remember we need to
 

333
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,790
if this returns now remember we need to
remove

334
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:06,800
remove
 

335
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,589
remove
remove this position remove this visited

336
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:11,599
remove this position remove this visited
 

337
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,589
remove this position remove this visited
so that the next step the next time

338
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:15,599
so that the next step the next time
 

339
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,990
so that the next step the next time
yeah next time because there are two

340
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:18,000
yeah next time because there are two
 

341
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,550
yeah next time because there are two
lateral partitions possible partitions

342
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:20,560
lateral partitions possible partitions
 

343
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,390
lateral partitions possible partitions
possible steps so i need to remove these

344
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:24,400
possible steps so i need to remove these
 

345
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,550
possible steps so i need to remove these
for the next move right if i jumping

346
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:26,560
for the next move right if i jumping
 

347
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,430
for the next move right if i jumping
backwards

348
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:27,440
backwards
 

349
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,869
backwards
which i didn't find a solution

350
00:08:30,869 --> 00:08:30,879
which i didn't find a solution
 

351
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,149
which i didn't find a solution
then i have to jump forward

352
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:34,159
then i have to jump forward
 

353
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,670
then i have to jump forward
to try right okay so and then what's

354
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:37,680
to try right okay so and then what's
 

355
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,750
to try right okay so and then what's
what's next what's here what should i do

356
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:39,760
what's next what's here what should i do
 

357
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,909
what's next what's here what should i do
here return

358
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:41,919
here return
 

359
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,230
here return
false yes because after this if we can't

360
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:44,240
false yes because after this if we can't
 

361
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,070
false yes because after this if we can't
find it

362
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:46,080
find it
 

363
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,190
find it
we return first right okay so do you

364
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:49,200
we return first right okay so do you
 

365
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,790
we return first right okay so do you
see yeah i see i see it

366
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:52,800
see yeah i see i see it
 

367
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,150
see yeah i see i see it
yeah i see it

368
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:56,160
yeah i see it
 

369
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,389
yeah i see it
so look at this notebook when we add it

370
00:08:58,389 --> 00:08:58,399
so look at this notebook when we add it
 

371
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,829
so look at this notebook when we add it
we need to remove it right

372
00:08:59,829 --> 00:08:59,839
we need to remove it right
 

373
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,190
we need to remove it right
i yeah it's better you can also you can

374
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:03,200
i yeah it's better you can also you can
 

375
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,590
i yeah it's better you can also you can
put this here but i don't think it's

376
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:05,600
put this here but i don't think it's
 

377
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,110
put this here but i don't think it's
quite necessary because

378
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:07,120
quite necessary because
 

379
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,150
quite necessary because
look if this has to come come in pairs

380
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:10,160
look if this has to come come in pairs
 

381
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,389
look if this has to come come in pairs
if you add it to the notebook then some

382
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:12,399
if you add it to the notebook then some
 

383
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,590
if you add it to the notebook then some
somehow you need to take it

384
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:13,600
somehow you need to take it
 

385
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,230
somehow you need to take it
print yeah bfs huh what do you mean

386
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:18,240
print yeah bfs huh what do you mean
 

387
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,950
print yeah bfs huh what do you mean
um

388
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:19,960

[Music]
 

391
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,710
[Music]
yeah it's optional okay for this one you

392
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:24,720
yeah it's optional okay for this one you
 

393
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,350
yeah it's optional okay for this one you
don't because

394
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:25,360
don't because
 

395
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,030
don't because
we already returned true so we don't

396
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:27,040
we already returned true so we don't
 

397
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,269
we already returned true so we don't
need to remove the remove the item from

398
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:29,279
need to remove the remove the item from
 

399
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:29,590
need to remove the remove the item from
the

400
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:29,600
the
 

401
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,269
the
platform but this one do you understand

402
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:31,279
platform but this one do you understand
 

403
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,430
platform but this one do you understand
why we need to remove it here

404
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:33,440
why we need to remove it here
 

405
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,750
why we need to remove it here
look suppose if i'm jumping backwards

406
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:35,760
look suppose if i'm jumping backwards
 

407
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,750
look suppose if i'm jumping backwards
right jumping backwards this is jumping

408
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:37,760
right jumping backwards this is jumping
 

409
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,949
right jumping backwards this is jumping
backwards

410
00:09:38,949 --> 00:09:38,959
backwards
 

411
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,829
backwards
right and i put this number i put these

412
00:09:41,829 --> 00:09:41,839
right and i put this number i put these
 

413
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,190
right and i put this number i put these
two in a notebook

414
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:43,200
two in a notebook
 

415
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,829
two in a notebook
i jumping backward and i found out i

416
00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:45,839
i jumping backward and i found out i
 

417
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,350
i jumping backward and i found out i
can't get the solution i can

418
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:47,360
can't get the solution i can
 

419
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,509
can't get the solution i can
i can't find the path by jumping

420
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:49,519
i can't find the path by jumping
 

421
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,870
i can't find the path by jumping
backwards

422
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:50,880
backwards
 

423
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,030
backwards
then the next one i should be jumping

424
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:53,040
then the next one i should be jumping
 

425
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,389
then the next one i should be jumping
forward right

426
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:54,399
forward right
 

427
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,230
forward right
if we jumping forward and then you need

428
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:56,240
if we jumping forward and then you need
 

429
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,870
if we jumping forward and then you need
to unmark a mark at least position you

430
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:58,880
to unmark a mark at least position you
 

431
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,750
to unmark a mark at least position you
have been

432
00:09:59,750 --> 00:09:59,760
have been
 

433
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,630
have been
visited because this belongs to the past

434
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:02,640
visited because this belongs to the past
 

435
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,990
visited because this belongs to the past
jumping backwards and then you'll need

436
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:04,000
jumping backwards and then you'll need
 

437
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,030
jumping backwards and then you'll need
to take it out

438
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,040
to take it out
 

439
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,990
to take it out
right so this is definitely search so do

440
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:08,000
right so this is definitely search so do
 

441
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,790
right so this is definitely search so do
you see

442
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:08,800
you see
 

443
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,910
you see
look if if i give an s i give it an

444
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:11,920
look if if i give an s i give it an
 

445
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,829
look if if i give an s i give it an
s i if i can find the path

446
00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:15,839
s i if i can find the path
 

447
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,389
s i if i can find the path
yeah yeah yeah don't and and i i would

448
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:18,399
yeah yeah yeah don't and and i i would
 

449
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,110
yeah yeah yeah don't and and i i would
go through

450
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:19,120
go through
 

451
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,910
go through
i go i will go as deep as i can by

452
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:21,920
i go i will go as deep as i can by
 

453
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,910
i go i will go as deep as i can by
following the past until i found one

454
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:23,920
following the past until i found one
 

455
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,710
following the past until i found one
right

456
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:24,720
right
 

457
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,110
right
you see that's called different search

458
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:27,120
you see that's called different search
 

459
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,990
you see that's called different search
yeah

460
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:28,000
yeah
 

461
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,190
yeah
it's like it's like a maze yeah you see

462
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:31,200
it's like it's like a maze yeah you see
 

463
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,470
it's like it's like a maze yeah you see
a maze yeah

464
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:32,480
a maze yeah
 

465
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,030
a maze yeah
you are here entering you are entering

466
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:35,040
you are here entering you are entering
 

467
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:35,750
you are here entering you are entering
you are here

468
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:35,760
you are here
 

469
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,910
you are here
yeah and then here's it it's exit

470
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:39,920
yeah and then here's it it's exit
 

471
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,389
yeah and then here's it it's exit
exit and there are some there are some

472
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:42,399
exit and there are some there are some
 

473
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,430
exit and there are some there are some
parts here yeah

474
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:43,440
parts here yeah
 

475
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,069
parts here yeah
and then the first search is that okay

476
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:46,079
and then the first search is that okay
 

477
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,269
and then the first search is that okay
if you can find

478
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:47,279
if you can find
 

479
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,069
if you can find
a path you just go as steep as you can

480
00:10:50,069 --> 00:10:50,079
a path you just go as steep as you can
 

481
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:50,389
a path you just go as steep as you can
as

482
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:50,399
as
 

483
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,550
as
the demands until you find it that's

484
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:52,560
the demands until you find it that's
 

485
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,509
the demands until you find it that's
cool

486
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:53,519
cool
 

487
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,350
cool
yeah yeah i know i've been tested how

488
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:55,360
yeah yeah i know i've been tested how
 

489
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,509
yeah yeah i know i've been tested how
what's best for research first version

490
00:10:57,509 --> 00:10:57,519
what's best for research first version
 

491
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,790
what's best for research first version
is like no no no question search is like

492
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:00,800
is like no no no question search is like
 

493
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,069
is like no no no question search is like
that okay

494
00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:02,079
that okay
 

495
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,150
that okay
okay what's the next step you can go

496
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:04,160
okay what's the next step you can go
 

497
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,190
okay what's the next step you can go
okay here

498
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:05,200
okay here
 

499
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,269
okay here
and then i can go here i can go here i

500
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:07,279
and then i can go here i can go here i
 

501
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,269
and then i can go here i can go here i
