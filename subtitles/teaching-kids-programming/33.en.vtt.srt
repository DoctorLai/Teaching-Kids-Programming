00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:30,000
hello yo okay so today
 

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,270
hello yo okay so today
our job is to sum the first and even

16
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:33,280
our job is to sum the first and even
 

17
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,389
our job is to sum the first and even
numbers yeah

18
00:00:34,389 --> 00:00:34,399
numbers yeah
 

19
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,630
numbers yeah
remember uh yesterday we talked about

20
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:36,640
remember uh yesterday we talked about
 

21
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,310
remember uh yesterday we talked about
the sum of the first

22
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:38,320
the sum of the first
 

23
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,750
the sum of the first
and odd numbers and now equation is one

24
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:41,760
and odd numbers and now equation is one
 

25
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,350
and odd numbers and now equation is one
n times n right yeah squared okay

26
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:45,360
n times n right yeah squared okay
 

27
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,709
n times n right yeah squared okay
n times n n squared and right now

28
00:00:48,709 --> 00:00:48,719
n times n n squared and right now
 

29
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,549
n times n n squared and right now
it's gonna be n times

30
00:00:52,549 --> 00:00:52,559
it's gonna be n times
 

31
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,590
it's gonna be n times
and at n

32
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:55,600
and at n
 

33
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,990
and at n
okay what why is that okay so i'm going

34
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:58,000
okay what why is that okay so i'm going
 

35
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,950
okay what why is that okay so i'm going
to teach you

36
00:00:58,950 --> 00:00:58,960
to teach you
 

37
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,029
to teach you
yeah this is the correct formula to sum

38
00:01:01,029 --> 00:01:01,039
yeah this is the correct formula to sum
 

39
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,029
yeah this is the correct formula to sum
up the first uh

40
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:03,039
up the first uh
 

41
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,789
up the first uh
and even numbers for example they are

42
00:01:04,789 --> 00:01:04,799
and even numbers for example they are
 

43
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,469
and even numbers for example they are
five right so the sum

44
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:06,479
five right so the sum
 

45
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,789
five right so the sum
is five times five plus five that's

46
00:01:08,789 --> 00:01:08,799
is five times five plus five that's
 

47
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:09,510
is five times five plus five that's
thirteen

48
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:09,520
thirteen
 

49
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,510
thirteen
am right 10

50
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:13,520
am right 10
 

51
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,710
am right 10
20 30. okay so yeah good question

52
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:16,720
20 30. okay so yeah good question
 

53
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,469
20 30. okay so yeah good question
why okay so why okay so

54
00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:20,479
why okay so why okay so
 

55
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,350
why okay so why okay so
so remember the first n numbers yeah

56
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:23,360
so remember the first n numbers yeah
 

57
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,789
so remember the first n numbers yeah
we're talking about the first n number

58
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:24,799
we're talking about the first n number
 

59
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,390
we're talking about the first n number
six properties first n numbers

60
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:26,400
six properties first n numbers
 

61
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,950
six properties first n numbers
yeah the sum you know in mathematics we

62
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:28,960
yeah the sum you know in mathematics we
 

63
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,990
yeah the sum you know in mathematics we
use this

64
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:30,000
use this
 

65
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,990
use this
this is this symbol yeah like e every n

66
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:34,000
this is this symbol yeah like e every n
 

67
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,469
this is this symbol yeah like e every n
yeah that's e e r e and then you can say

68
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:40,479
yeah that's e e r e and then you can say
 

69
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:40,870
yeah that's e e r e and then you can say
i

70
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:40,880
i
 

71
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,310
i
equals 1 to n yeah

72
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:44,320
equals 1 to n yeah
 

73
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,590
equals 1 to n yeah
and then you can sum i so let means

74
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:47,600
and then you can sum i so let means
 

75
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,870
and then you can sum i so let means
that means i equals 1 plus 2

76
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:50,880
that means i equals 1 plus 2
 

77
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,990
that means i equals 1 plus 2
2 plus 3 plus t of n okay

78
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:54,000
2 plus 3 plus t of n okay
 

79
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,350
2 plus 3 plus t of n okay
so basically this is a mathematic

80
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:57,360
so basically this is a mathematic
 

81
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,550
so basically this is a mathematic
symbol to say okay i want the sum

82
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:00,560
symbol to say okay i want the sum
 

83
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,830
symbol to say okay i want the sum
i i equals from one to n sometimes you

84
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:03,840
i i equals from one to n sometimes you
 

85
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,389
i i equals from one to n sometimes you
can

86
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:04,399
can
 

87
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,429
can
just say one to n okay so let's okay

88
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:07,439
just say one to n okay so let's okay
 

89
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:07,990
just say one to n okay so let's okay
let's look

90
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:08,000
let's look
 

91
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,510
let's look
like a sum okay sum from one to n

92
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:11,520
like a sum okay sum from one to n
 

93
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,470
like a sum okay sum from one to n
some i so let's read okay so what's this

94
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:14,480
some i so let's read okay so what's this
 

95
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,229
some i so let's read okay so what's this
equation

96
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:16,239
equation
 

97
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,830
equation
uh remember how what's the equation for

98
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:20,840
uh remember how what's the equation for
 

99
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,070
uh remember how what's the equation for
this

100
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:22,080
this
 

101
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,990
this
okay so that's a quick way to understand

102
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:24,000
okay so that's a quick way to understand
 

103
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,190
okay so that's a quick way to understand
it okay so this sum

104
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:25,200
it okay so this sum
 

105
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,350
it okay so this sum
is that the first item what's the first

106
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:27,360
is that the first item what's the first
 

107
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,710
is that the first item what's the first
item of this

108
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:28,720
item of this
 

109
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,670
item of this
we call it one number progression yeah

110
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:31,680
we call it one number progression yeah
 

111
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,470
we call it one number progression yeah
we call it all

112
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:32,480
we call it all
 

113
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,830
we call it all
these are three how how do you spell

114
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:35,840
these are three how how do you spell
 

115
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,910
these are three how how do you spell
this automatic

116
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:36,920
this automatic
 

117
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,390
this automatic
mathematic asthmatic progression

118
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:40,400
mathematic asthmatic progression
 

119
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,509
mathematic asthmatic progression
okay i don't know how to spell it so the

120
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:43,519
okay i don't know how to spell it so the
 

121
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:44,229
okay i don't know how to spell it so the
first item

122
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:44,239
first item
 

123
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,910
first item
is an experiment one first

124
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:47,920
is an experiment one first
 

125
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,509
is an experiment one first
item last item okay

126
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:51,519
item last item okay
 

127
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,910
item last item okay
so let me equation yeah yeah first item

128
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:53,920
so let me equation yeah yeah first item
 

129
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,949
so let me equation yeah yeah first item
plus

130
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:54,959
plus
 

131
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,990
plus
last item comes and how many items

132
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,000
last item comes and how many items
 

133
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,910
last item comes and how many items
how many how many

134
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:01,920
how many how many
 

135
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,229
how many how many
and then divided by two okay so if you

136
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:04,239
and then divided by two okay so if you
 

137
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:05,830
and then divided by two okay so if you
do this the first item is

138
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:05,840
do this the first item is
 

139
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,149
do this the first item is
one yeah the last item is

140
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:10,159
one yeah the last item is
 

141
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,149
one yeah the last item is
how many items divided by two

142
00:03:14,149 --> 00:03:14,159
how many items divided by two
 

143
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,309
how many items divided by two
okay so this is the number for example

144
00:03:16,309 --> 00:03:16,319
okay so this is the number for example
 

145
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,520
okay so this is the number for example
one two

146
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:19,530

 

147
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:22,869

[Music]

148
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:22,879
[Music]
 

149
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,589
[Music]
yeah from one look one to a hundred is

150
00:03:25,589 --> 00:03:25,599
yeah from one look one to a hundred is
 

151
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,589
yeah from one look one to a hundred is
one plus a hundred

152
00:03:27,589 --> 00:03:27,599
one plus a hundred
 

153
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,830
one plus a hundred
times a hundred divided by two so that's

154
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:30,840
times a hundred divided by two so that's
 

155
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,190
times a hundred divided by two so that's
what

156
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:33,200
what
 

157
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,630
what
that's 50 50. okay

158
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:36,640
that's 50 50. okay
 

159
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,710
that's 50 50. okay
yes 50 50. yeah you got it you have to

160
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:40,720
yes 50 50. yeah you got it you have to
 

161
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,910
yes 50 50. yeah you got it you have to
sum the numbers from from one to 100

162
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:43,920
sum the numbers from from one to 100
 

163
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,309
sum the numbers from from one to 100
okay

164
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:44,319
okay
 

165
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,350
okay
so now we know this yeah uh actually

166
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:47,360
so now we know this yeah uh actually
 

167
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,149
so now we know this yeah uh actually
we can we can use the mathematic

168
00:03:50,149 --> 00:03:50,159
we can we can use the mathematic
 

169
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,190
we can we can use the mathematic
induction to do this

170
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:51,200
induction to do this
 

171
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,309
induction to do this
as well right right and don't touch it

172
00:03:54,309 --> 00:03:54,319
as well right right and don't touch it
 

173
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,710
as well right right and don't touch it
we can do this mathematic equation now

174
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:56,720
we can do this mathematic equation now
 

175
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,589
we can do this mathematic equation now
we're gonna

176
00:03:57,589 --> 00:03:57,599
we're gonna
 

177
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,300
we're gonna
teach you about now

178
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:00,310
teach you about now
 

179
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:07,190
teach you about now
[Music]

180
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:07,200

 

181
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,470

no no no look okay so one n

182
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:10,480
no no no look okay so one n
 

183
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,789
no no no look okay so one n
base case mathematic induction when base

184
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:12,799
base case mathematic induction when base
 

185
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,229
base case mathematic induction when base
case when n is one

186
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:14,239
case when n is one
 

187
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,430
case when n is one
so let's sum i is one next plane will be

188
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:17,440
so let's sum i is one next plane will be
 

189
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,789
so let's sum i is one next plane will be
one right because the first

190
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:18,799
one right because the first
 

191
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:21,909
one right because the first
first one number yeah okay so let's say

192
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:21,919
first one number yeah okay so let's say
 

193
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:25,030
first one number yeah okay so let's say
f k equals this is the one times uh

194
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:25,040
f k equals this is the one times uh
 

195
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,150
f k equals this is the one times uh
k times one plus one times k

196
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:28,160
k times one plus one times k
 

197
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,030
k times one plus one times k
divided by two okay yeah and now we want

198
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:31,040
divided by two okay yeah and now we want
 

199
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,110
divided by two okay yeah and now we want
to add one more item so fk

200
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:33,120
to add one more item so fk
 

201
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,950
to add one more item so fk
k plus one equals this yeah fk

202
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:36,960
k plus one equals this yeah fk
 

203
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:50,870
k plus one equals this yeah fk
plus one plus what plus

204
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:50,880

 

205
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,350

this is the k because this is sum from

206
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:53,360
this is the k because this is sum from
 

207
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,710
this is the k because this is sum from
the first k numbers and

208
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:54,720
the first k numbers and
 

209
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,909
the first k numbers and
we want to plus one more yeah okay

210
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:57,919
we want to plus one more yeah okay
 

211
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,510
we want to plus one more yeah okay
so look if we we substitute this

212
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:01,520
so look if we we substitute this
 

213
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,430
so look if we we substitute this
in so k plus one times k divided by two

214
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:05,440
in so k plus one times k divided by two
 

215
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,110
in so k plus one times k divided by two
plus k plus one right

216
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:07,120
plus k plus one right
 

217
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,230
plus k plus one right
yes and then if i put a two here that

218
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:10,240
yes and then if i put a two here that
 

219
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:10,629
yes and then if i put a two here that
needs

220
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:10,639
needs
 

221
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,150
needs
these to be two right yeah so this

222
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,160
these to be two right yeah so this
 

223
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,070
these to be two right yeah so this
this thing so it's equals to k

224
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,080
this thing so it's equals to k
 

225
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,189
this thing so it's equals to k
times k k square plus k plus

226
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:21,199
times k k square plus k plus
 

227
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,390
times k k square plus k plus
two k plus two okay

228
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:24,400
two k plus two okay
 

229
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,590
two k plus two okay
k squared okay yeah k times k is k

230
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:27,600
k squared okay yeah k times k is k
 

231
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,629
k squared okay yeah k times k is k
squared 1 2

232
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:30,639
squared 1 2
 

233
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,590
squared 1 2
okay so how do we simplify this so

234
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:35,600

 

235
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,029

look k remember k plus 1 square equals k

236
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:39,039
look k remember k plus 1 square equals k
 

237
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,270
look k remember k plus 1 square equals k
square plus 2 k plus 1 right yeah

238
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:43,280
square plus 2 k plus 1 right yeah
 

239
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,029
square plus 2 k plus 1 right yeah
so look k 2 2 and then i can

240
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:47,039
so look k 2 2 and then i can
 

241
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,150
so look k 2 2 and then i can
these 2 will be 1 plus 1 right yes

242
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:50,160
these 2 will be 1 plus 1 right yes
 

243
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,110
these 2 will be 1 plus 1 right yes
i take away so this is k plus one square

244
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:53,120
i take away so this is k plus one square
 

245
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,629
i take away so this is k plus one square
and then pick k plus one so what does

246
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:54,639
and then pick k plus one so what does
 

247
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,990
and then pick k plus one so what does
this mean this thing

248
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:56,000
this mean this thing
 

249
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,990
this mean this thing
equals k plus one square

250
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,000
equals k plus one square
 

251
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,430
equals k plus one square
yeah plus k plus one

252
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:03,440
yeah plus k plus one
 

253
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,029
yeah plus k plus one
okay and divided by two and if i

254
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:07,039
okay and divided by two and if i
 

255
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,150
okay and divided by two and if i
do the k plus one so that will be k

256
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:10,160
do the k plus one so that will be k
 

257
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,990
do the k plus one so that will be k
k plus one times k plus one plus one

258
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:14,000
k plus one times k plus one plus one
 

259
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,710
k plus one times k plus one plus one
okay so what does it mean this is this

260
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:16,720
okay so what does it mean this is this
 

261
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,110
okay so what does it mean this is this
is

262
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,120
is
 

263
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,029
is
n this is n and two so it's the same

264
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:21,039
n this is n and two so it's the same
 

265
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:21,670
n this is n and two so it's the same
form as k

266
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:21,680
form as k
 

267
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,870
form as k
plus one times uh n plus one times

268
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:24,880
plus one times uh n plus one times
 

269
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,270
plus one times uh n plus one times
n divided by two by two okay so that

270
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:27,280
n divided by two by two okay so that
 

271
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,629
n divided by two by two okay so that
means that this formula is correct okay

272
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:30,639
means that this formula is correct okay
 

273
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,029
means that this formula is correct okay
so now yesterday we already proved so we

274
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:33,039
so now yesterday we already proved so we
 

275
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,110
so now yesterday we already proved so we
don't need to prove it again so this

276
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:35,120
don't need to prove it again so this
 

277
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,430
don't need to prove it again so this
remember this is the sum of the first n

278
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:37,440
remember this is the sum of the first n
 

279
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,870
remember this is the sum of the first n
numbers right

280
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:38,880
numbers right
 

281
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,110
numbers right
yes and we have we know the sum of the

282
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:41,120
yes and we have we know the sum of the
 

283
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,070
yes and we have we know the sum of the
first and

284
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:42,080
first and
 

285
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,510
first and
all numbers yes which is squared

286
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:45,520
all numbers yes which is squared
 

287
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,469
all numbers yes which is squared
n squared right n times n yeah so it

288
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:48,479
n squared right n times n yeah so it
 

289
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:49,430
n squared right n times n yeah so it
means that

290
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:49,440
means that
 

291
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,110
means that
if if i do this

292
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:53,120
if if i do this
 

293
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,230
if if i do this
this is the sum of all n numbers yes and

294
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:56,240
this is the sum of all n numbers yes and
 

295
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,469
this is the sum of all n numbers yes and
i

296
00:06:56,469 --> 00:06:56,479
i
 

297
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,830
i
one minus the first and

298
00:06:59,830 --> 00:06:59,840
one minus the first and
 

299
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,189
one minus the first and
even all numbers

300
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:03,199
even all numbers
 

301
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,870
even all numbers
and what's these what's this

302
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:06,880
and what's these what's this
 

303
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,110
and what's these what's this
that will be the first and even numbers

304
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:09,120
that will be the first and even numbers
 

305
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,230
that will be the first and even numbers
right because i

306
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:10,240
right because i
 

307
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,710
right because i
this is total numbers and i remove i

308
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:12,720
this is total numbers and i remove i
 

309
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,830
this is total numbers and i remove i
detect the

310
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:13,840
detect the
 

311
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,670
detect the
even number or number and that would be

312
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:15,680
even number or number and that would be
 

313
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,270
even number or number and that would be
the even numbers right yeah

314
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:17,280
the even numbers right yeah
 

315
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,909
the even numbers right yeah
yeah yeah yeah okay so we this is the

316
00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:19,919
yeah yeah yeah okay so we this is the
 

317
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,189
yeah yeah yeah okay so we this is the
formula we want to

318
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:21,199
formula we want to
 

319
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,110
formula we want to
we want to know okay so this is this

yeah yeah okay so what's this
 

325
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,309
yeah yeah okay so what's this
look that equals two n squared

326
00:07:34,309 --> 00:07:34,319
look that equals two n squared
 

327
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,510
look that equals two n squared
plus n minus two n square right

328
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:37,520
plus n minus two n square right
 

329
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,150
plus n minus two n square right
yeah what are you doing with this sorry

330

oh i think there's a problem and n
 

335
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:52,390
oh i think there's a problem and n
plus n plus 1 plus n divided by 2

336
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:52,400
plus n plus 1 plus n divided by 2
 

337
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,430
plus n plus 1 plus n divided by 2
minus is it n square first and even

338
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:55,440
minus is it n square first and even
 

339
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:11,029
minus is it n square first and even
numbers

340
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:11,039

 

341
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,749

00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:34,159
so let's first end numbers yes
 

361
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:39,840
so let's first end numbers yes
yeah so how many even numbers

362
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:39,850

okay let's let's put it this way because
lee look

368
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:44,399
lee look
 

369
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,310
lee look
because this n could be all or could be

370
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:46,320
because this n could be all or could be
 

371
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,150
because this n could be all or could be
even right yeah so

372
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:48,160
even right yeah so
 

373
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,590
even right yeah so
so how about let's say i i want

374
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:51,600
so how about let's say i i want
 

375
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,509
so how about let's say i i want
uh the first and the first and

376
00:08:55,509 --> 00:08:55,519
uh the first and the first and
 

377
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,509
uh the first and the first and
all numbers yeah all numbers

378
00:08:59,509 --> 00:08:59,519
all numbers yeah all numbers
 

379
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,949
all numbers yeah all numbers
sum is n square right

380
00:09:02,949 --> 00:09:02,959
sum is n square right
 

381
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,230
sum is n square right
yeah and then n square

382
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:06,240
yeah and then n square
 

383
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,030
yeah and then n square
plus the first uh let x we are not we

384
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,040
plus the first uh let x we are not we
 

385
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,870
plus the first uh let x we are not we
want we want to know the first and even

386
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:10,880
want we want to know the first and even
 

387
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,150
want we want to know the first and even
numbers yeah

388
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:12,160
numbers yeah
 

389
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,670
numbers yeah
right and then equals it will be equals

390
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:15,680
right and then equals it will be equals
 

391
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,710
right and then equals it will be equals
to 2n not

392
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:16,720
to 2n not
 

393
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,110
to 2n not
n right because look there are n numbers

394
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:19,120
n right because look there are n numbers
 

395
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,870
n right because look there are n numbers
and then n numbers there will be two

396
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:20,880
and then n numbers there will be two
 

397
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,430
and then n numbers there will be two
ends

398
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:21,440
ends
 

399
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,470
ends
not an n okay yeah so

400
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:24,480
not an n okay yeah so
 

401
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,310
not an n okay yeah so
that will be n will be 2 n so that will

402
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:26,320
that will be n will be 2 n so that will
 

403
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,910
that will be n will be 2 n so that will
be 2 n

404
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:27,920
be 2 n
 

405
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,230
be 2 n
times 2 n plus 1 divided by 2 right

406
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:32,240
times 2 n plus 1 divided by 2 right
 

407
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,310
times 2 n plus 1 divided by 2 right
yeah because there are two numbers not

408
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:34,320
yeah because there are two numbers not
 

409
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,230
yeah because there are two numbers not
numbers yeah

410
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:36,240
numbers yeah
 

411
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,430
numbers yeah
yeah this is all sum of e

412
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:39,440
yeah this is all sum of e
 

413
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,030
yeah this is all sum of e
all numbers yeah and n all numbers

414
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,040
all numbers yeah and n all numbers
 

415
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,150
all numbers yeah and n all numbers
plus n even numbers how many numbers are

416
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:46,160
plus n even numbers how many numbers are
 

417
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,190
plus n even numbers how many numbers are
there

418
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:47,200
there
 

419
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,630
there
n n and n there are n numbers

420
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:50,640
n n and n there are n numbers
 

421
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,949
n n and n there are n numbers
n all numbers and n even numbers so how

422
00:09:52,949 --> 00:09:52,959
n all numbers and n even numbers so how
 

423
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,230
n all numbers and n even numbers so how
many numbers are there

424
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:54,240
many numbers are there
 

425
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,430
many numbers are there
m two n to one because they're n

426
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:57,440
m two n to one because they're n
 

427
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,829
m two n to one because they're n
and nano p two n right yeah so that's

428
00:09:59,829 --> 00:09:59,839
and nano p two n right yeah so that's
 

429
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:00,870
and nano p two n right yeah so that's
two n

430
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:00,880
two n
 

431
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,389
two n
you will not see the one that's the sum

432
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:02,399
you will not see the one that's the sum
 

433
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,870
you will not see the one that's the sum
of the if this i put this is

434
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:04,880
of the if this i put this is
 

435
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,269
of the if this i put this is
making this into 2n so that would be 2 n

436
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:07,279
making this into 2n so that would be 2 n
 

437
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,829
making this into 2n so that would be 2 n
and 2n plus 1 yeah divided by y

438
00:10:09,829 --> 00:10:09,839
and 2n plus 1 yeah divided by y
 

439
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,870
and 2n plus 1 yeah divided by y
okay so the two even numbers plus two

440
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:12,880
okay so the two even numbers plus two
 

441
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,630
okay so the two even numbers plus two
odd numbers so how many numbers are

442
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:14,640
odd numbers so how many numbers are
 

443
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,990
odd numbers so how many numbers are
there

444
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,000
there
 

445
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,269
there
is a

446
00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:21,279

 

447
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:25,590

um one two

448
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:25,600
um one two
 

449
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,870
um one two
two two numbers two even numbers that

450
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:28,880
two two numbers two even numbers that
 

451
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,069
two two numbers two even numbers that
would be two four right

452
00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:30,079
would be two four right
 

453
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,150
would be two four right
yeah two out numbers that will be one

454
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:32,160
yeah two out numbers that will be one
 

455
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,389
yeah two out numbers that will be one
three so how many numbers are there

456
00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:34,399
three so how many numbers are there
 

457
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,829
three so how many numbers are there
what do you mean one three and two four

458
00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:37,839
what do you mean one three and two four
 

459
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,269
what do you mean one three and two four
two two oh uh there are two even numbers

460
00:10:41,269 --> 00:10:41,279
two two oh uh there are two even numbers
 

461
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:41,750
two two oh uh there are two even numbers
that will be

462
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:41,760
that will be
 

463
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,590
that will be
two and four and then two all numbers

464
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:43,600
two and four and then two all numbers
 

465
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,190
two and four and then two all numbers
there will be one and three so how many

466
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:45,200
there will be one and three so how many
 

467
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,829
there will be one and three so how many
numbers are there four yeah easy so

468
00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:47,839
numbers are there four yeah easy so
 

469
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,190
numbers are there four yeah easy so
that's four numbers so

470
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:49,200
that's four numbers so
 

471
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,910
that's four numbers so
so the sum of these n is two right so

472
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:51,920
so the sum of these n is two right so
 

473
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,150
so the sum of these n is two right so
the sum of one plus two plus three plus

474
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:54,160
the sum of one plus two plus three plus
 

475
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,190
the sum of one plus two plus three plus
four would be

476
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:55,200
four would be
 

477
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,310
four would be
uh this formula this formula

478
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:58,320
uh this formula this formula
 

479
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,550
uh this formula this formula
but what but we need to choose this n as

480
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:00,560
but what but we need to choose this n as
 

481
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,470
but what but we need to choose this n as
2n yeah because there are four numbers

482
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:02,480
2n yeah because there are four numbers
 

483
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,030
2n yeah because there are four numbers
yeah

484
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:03,040
yeah
 

485
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,389
yeah
got it okay easy yeah

486
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:06,399
got it okay easy yeah
 

487
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,590
got it okay easy yeah
okay so now we just need to x x

488
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:09,600
okay so now we just need to x x
 

489
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,310
okay so now we just need to x x
equals one so if i divide b two so that

490
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:12,320
equals one so if i divide b two so that
 

491
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,269
equals one so if i divide b two so that
would be two right

492
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:13,279
would be two right
 

493
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,710
would be two right
so that would be what two n square

494
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:16,720
so that would be what two n square
 

495
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,750
so that would be what two n square
plus n minus n square okay

496
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:19,760
plus n minus n square okay
 

497
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,870
plus n minus n square okay
so can you simplify this two n squared

498
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:22,880
so can you simplify this two n squared
 

499
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,350
so can you simplify this two n squared
minus

500
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:23,360
minus
 

501
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,470
minus
n square n

502
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:26,480
n square n
 

503
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,069
n square n
square plus n yes so this is the formula

504
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:30,079
square plus n yes so this is the formula
 

505
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,670
square plus n yes so this is the formula
yeah we just move here yeah

506
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:31,680
yeah we just move here yeah
 

507
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,870
yeah we just move here yeah
that's the sum of the first

508
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:34,880
that's the sum of the first
 

509
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,550
that's the sum of the first
even right first sum you might notice

510
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:38,560
even right first sum you might notice
 

511
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,230
even right first sum you might notice
yeah i'm going to do the coding

512
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:40,240
yeah i'm going to do the coding
 

513
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:49,990
yeah i'm going to do the coding
yeah yeah wait wait

514
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:50,000

 

515
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,350

n times n plus n when n is one

516
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:55,360
n times n plus n when n is one
 

517
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,990
n times n plus n when n is one
the sum is two right the sum should be

518
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:58,000
the sum is two right the sum should be
 

519
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,590
the sum is two right the sum should be
two right

520
00:11:59,590 --> 00:11:59,600
two right
 

521
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,949
two right
yeah all right the first

522
00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:02,959
yeah all right the first
 

523
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,069
yeah all right the first
one even number that would be two right

524
00:12:06,069 --> 00:12:06,079
one even number that would be two right
 

525
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,269
one even number that would be two right
yes okay so let's say fk again

526
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:09,279
yes okay so let's say fk again
 

527
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,870
yes okay so let's say fk again
k times k plus k and then f k

528
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:12,880
k times k plus k and then f k
 

529
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:18,949
k times k plus k and then f k
k plus one equals f k plus one

530
00:12:18,949 --> 00:12:18,959

 

531
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,829

so what's the next next what's the name

532
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:22,839
so what's the next next what's the name
 

533
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:24,710
so what's the next next what's the name
one uh

534
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:24,720
one uh
 

535
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,910
one uh
no only because this is the look if k is

536
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:27,920
no only because this is the look if k is
 

537
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,870
no only because this is the look if k is
one right

538
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:28,880
one right
 

539
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:34,389
one right
f1 is one right and f2 will be

540
00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:34,399
f1 is one right and f2 will be
 

541
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,430
f1 is one right and f2 will be
f1 plus the second

542
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:37,440
f1 plus the second
 

543
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,750
f1 plus the second
the second even number that would be

544
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:39,760
the second even number that would be
 

545
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,949
the second even number that would be
four right

546
00:12:40,949 --> 00:12:40,959
four right
 

547
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,150
four right
yes so this four is what

548
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:44,160
yes so this four is what
 

549
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,230
yes so this four is what
two times k plus one right am right

550
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:48,240
two times k plus one right am right
 

551
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,069
two times k plus one right am right
k is one k is two uh

552
00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:52,079
k is one k is two uh
 

553
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,190
k is one k is two uh
take k is one and k plus one would be k

554
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:55,200
take k is one and k plus one would be k
 

555
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,110
take k is one and k plus one would be k
plus one so that would be

556
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:57,120
plus one so that would be
 

557
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,310
plus one so that would be
uh two times k plus one right

558
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:00,320
uh two times k plus one right
 

559
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,110
uh two times k plus one right
let's try another one f two equals

560
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:03,120
let's try another one f two equals
 

561
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,230
let's try another one f two equals
exactly one

562
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:04,240
exactly one
 

563
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,269
exactly one
f three equals f2 plus what

564
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:07,279
f three equals f2 plus what
 

565
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,710
f three equals f2 plus what
3 will be 2 4 6 yeah so k is 2

566
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:10,720
3 will be 2 4 6 yeah so k is 2
 

567
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,910
3 will be 2 4 6 yeah so k is 2
2 2 times 2 plus 1 so

568
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:13,920
2 2 times 2 plus 1 so
 

569
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,230
2 2 times 2 plus 1 so
i want to add a 6 okay so it should be

570
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:16,240
i want to add a 6 okay so it should be
 

571
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,550
i want to add a 6 okay so it should be
adding this 2 k plus 1

572
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:18,560
adding this 2 k plus 1
 

573
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,590
adding this 2 k plus 1
okay so that equals what k squared plus

574
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:21,600
okay so that equals what k squared plus
 

575
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,230
okay so that equals what k squared plus
k

576
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:22,240
k
 

577
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,910
k
plus 2k plus 2 right

578
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:25,920
plus 2k plus 2 right
 

579
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,910
plus 2k plus 2 right
yes yes all right

580
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:29,920

 

581
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,949

is it right

582
00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:34,959
is it right
 

583
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,629
is it right
oh you're touching that thing okay

584
00:13:38,629 --> 00:13:38,639
oh you're touching that thing okay
 

585
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,110
oh you're touching that thing okay
okay don't touch it okay now next thing

586
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:41,120
okay don't touch it okay now next thing
 

587
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,670
okay don't touch it okay now next thing
we're gonna do is recording pause no no

588
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:43,680
we're gonna do is recording pause no no
 

589
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,629
we're gonna do is recording pause no no
no we haven't pulled

590
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:44,639
no we haven't pulled
 

591
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,750
no we haven't pulled
it yet so that that would be uh

592
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:47,760
it yet so that that would be uh
 

593
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,790
it yet so that that would be uh
we want to prove is the same form of

594
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:50,800
we want to prove is the same form of
 

595
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,910
we want to prove is the same form of
this right so so so that would be

596
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:53,920
this right so so so that would be
 

597
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,430
this right so so so that would be
k uh plus one

598
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:57,440
k uh plus one
 

599
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,790
k uh plus one
k plus one square this will be k

600
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:00,800
k plus one square this will be k
 

601
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,150
k plus one square this will be k
plus k square plus 2 k plus 1 right

602
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:04,160
plus k square plus 2 k plus 1 right
 

603
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,550
plus k square plus 2 k plus 1 right
so how many will be left if i take away

604
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:06,560
so how many will be left if i take away
 

605
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,150
so how many will be left if i take away
this from here

606
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:08,160
this from here
 

607
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,949
this from here
then what that would be another k plus

608
00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:10,959
then what that would be another k plus
 

609
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,949
then what that would be another k plus
one right you see

610
00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:12,959
one right you see
 

611
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,990
one right you see
you see we just prove f k plus 1 is k

612
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:16,000
you see we just prove f k plus 1 is k
 

613
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,710
you see we just prove f k plus 1 is k
plus 1 square plus k plus 1 so if we

614
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:18,720
plus 1 square plus k plus 1 so if we
 

615
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,750
plus 1 square plus k plus 1 so if we
take this is k

616
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:19,760
take this is k
 

617
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,910
take this is k
this is k so it's the same form of this

618
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:21,920
this is k so it's the same form of this
 

619
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,269
this is k so it's the same form of this
n right so it's

620
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:23,279
n right so it's
 

621
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,310
n right so it's
correct okay so now i'm going to

622
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:26,320
correct okay so now i'm going to
 

623
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,430

n times n plus n okay oh
 

659
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:46,790
n times n plus n okay oh
this one is

660
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:46,800

 

661
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,189

it doesn't matter which input how big is

662
00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:49,199
it doesn't matter which input how big is
 

663
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,350
it doesn't matter which input how big is
your input i can always calculate it

664
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:51,360
your input i can always calculate it
 

665
00:15:51,360 --> 00:16:03,749
your input i can always calculate it
in constant time yeah

666
00:16:03,749 --> 00:16:03,759

 

667
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,790

n times n plus n okay in python

668
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:06,800
n times n plus n okay in python
 

669
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,509
n times n plus n okay in python
in python we have a phone you know from

maybe not maybe not maybe there's a

680
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:20,880
maybe not maybe not maybe there's a
 

681
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,069
maybe not maybe not maybe there's a
function

682
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:22,079
function
 

683
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,949
function
no no no i don't think this okay i would

684
00:16:24,949 --> 00:16:24,959
no no no i don't think this okay i would
 

685
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:25,910
no no no i don't think this okay i would
double check this

686
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:25,920
double check this
 

687
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,030
double check this
maybe it's power power and then i can

688
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:29,040
maybe it's power power and then i can
 

689
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,189
maybe it's power power and then i can
write power n2 right so let me use

690
00:16:31,189 --> 00:16:31,199
write power n2 right so let me use
 

691
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:37,430
write power n2 right so let me use
n to the power of two right pow okay so

692
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:37,440
n to the power of two right pow okay so
 

693
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,069
n to the power of two right pow okay so
remember in person yeah if you want to

694
00:16:40,069 --> 00:16:40,079
remember in person yeah if you want to
 

695
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:40,550
remember in person yeah if you want to
write

696
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:40,560
write
 

697
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,749
write
a to the top power of b yes

698
00:16:43,749 --> 00:16:43,759
a to the top power of b yes
 

699
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,509
a to the top power of b yes
you can write this way a guess what

700
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:47,519
you can write this way a guess what
 

701
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:59,910
you can write this way a guess what
guess what

702
00:16:59,910 --> 00:16:59,920

 

703
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,110

that's okay one pie yeah yeah but i have

704
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:03,120
that's okay one pie yeah yeah but i have
 

705
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,870
that's okay one pie yeah yeah but i have
to put another multiply b

706
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:04,880
to put another multiply b
 

707
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,270
to put another multiply b
so that's imperson you can do it this

708
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:07,280
so that's imperson you can do it this
 

709
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,309
so that's imperson you can do it this
way right times

710
00:17:08,309 --> 00:17:08,319
way right times
 

711
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,870
way right times
time it means a to the power of b okay

712
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:10,880
time it means a to the power of b okay
 

713
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,990
time it means a to the power of b okay
so if i do this

714
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:12,000
so if i do this
 

715
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,110
so if i do this
a 2 power power

716
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:15,120
a 2 power power
 

717
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,510
a 2 power power
3 what's the answer

718
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:19,520
3 what's the answer
 

719
