1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,580
up hello

2
00:00:02,959 --> 00:00:08,899
so you know the triangle right we're

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,899
triangle three point

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:15,839
yes triangle

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:19,320
so that's not a drawing girl it's wonky

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,779
okay okay so given three points in 2D

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,880
space right I put us I randomly put the

8
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:26,760
three points can you tell me what are

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:29,400
the criteria for for them to become a

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,740
triangle if I you know connect the lines

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,980
between dots

12
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:37,140
I can put three dots on the space so for

13
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,540
the three dots to be a triangle what

14
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,059
kind of requirement do you have yeah

15
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,040
this

16
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:46,140
this is my triangle right they're on the

17
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,320
same line right so it does not become a

18
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,320
train

19
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:52,780
so what are the requirements

20
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,340
um

21
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:59,120
[Music]

22
00:00:55,340 --> 00:01:03,180
it's two must be like on the same line

23
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:06,180
and it on the same line and

24
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,180
everyone

25
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,979
unless unless it's on the same line as a

26
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,840
young team two points on the center and

27
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:14,880
two points we can have a line between

28
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,360
them as long as they are not the same

29
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,640
right yeah so in other words these three

30
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:24,360
dots three points

31
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:27,659
conform uh trying as long as these three

32
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,700
are not on the same line if two points

33
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:33,740
here leave three dots are on the same

34
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,740
line so it does not form a triangle

35
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:38,160
[Music]

36
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:50,640
total distance of any two sides are

37
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:54,780
bigger than the third one how do we do

38
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:58,799
this this side A plus b is bigger than c

39
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:02,000
y how can we prove this because a equals

40
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,000
11 b equals

41
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:10,020
so you're all connected and C C is a

42
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:13,140
line and the other two are two two lines

43
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:16,440
and if you split them apart like that it

44
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:19,260
the A and B is like that and the C is

45
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:22,140
like that it's easy to spot it but it's

46
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:25,260
hard to prove right I mean it's very

47
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:28,760
obvious mathematics sometimes it's very

48
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:34,280
easy to see but yeah

49
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:34,280
you need to explain stuff like

50
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:48,260
what happened

51
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:52,200
a plus b equals c what happens

52
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:55,379
so a will be in this line right if the

53
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:58,500
point is Allah it's not on the line then

54
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:59,879
a plus b bigger than C because this is

55
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,099
the straight line yeah that's the

56
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:04,500
straight distance if you want to go from

57
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:07,500
P to C this is the shortest distance

58
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:11,280
right any other point this is bigger

59
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:14,099
right okay we got that okay okay so now

60
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,640
today question simple given a few

61
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:16,640
integers

62
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:23,099
five okay so for example

63
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:26,180
parameters so what parameter a plus b

64
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:26,180
plus C foreign

65
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:38,519
to form a triangle to form a triangle

66
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,440
and we want to maximize the parameters

67
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:42,959
okay so for example at least two three

68
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:45,659
one five can you pick three integers to

69
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:49,379
form three integers as a side of each

70
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:51,120
triangle right then to maximize the

71
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:53,340
parameters

72
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,720
okay so this is a bit tricky five three

73
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:58,080
two

74
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,540
you're very close can we have a child

75
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:04,680
easily three numbers no why is that

76
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:07,080
because five and three so look five

77
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,900
three two so this is five this is two

78
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:12,599
this two three plus two is it bigger

79
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:16,260
than five no so no okay so how about if

80
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:19,139
I put this uh four what the fuck what's

81
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:22,139
the maximal parameters triangle we can

82
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:23,600
have by picking three integers as a side

83
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:25,940
of each child

84
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,680
okay give it what's the one before

85
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:31,440
that's good question okay if I pull up

86
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:34,919
five what's three three

87
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,479
um one two and five one two three right

88
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:39,840
if we pick a five

89
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:42,600
we can't find any other two sides is

90
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,900
bigger than five so we don't use five no

91
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,280
three two one no three two one three

92
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,919
plus two plus

93
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:53,280
four plus two degrees there has to be

94
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,660
because then a or b i I see so there's

95
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,780
no answer here that's another answer

96
00:04:54,660 --> 00:05:01,639
okay yeah you're right that's yeah okay

97
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:07,199
so yeah my mistake so three two maybe

98
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:09,600
zero no no no no maybe two okay so two

99
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,419
plus two is bigger than three I need two

100
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,900
sides okay come on any two sides a plus

101
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:17,220
b equals c yeah so look one plus two is

102
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,320
equal and three it's not bigger than

103
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:21,740
three thousand we can't have a triangle

104
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:24,479
like that right another question ten

105
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:29,400
nine seven

106
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:32,400
Seven Ten nine six one four five okay

107
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:34,500
what's the maximum parameters we can

108
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,800
have by picking three points here seven

109
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,620
four ten seven four ten C four C four C

110
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,240
four dead four therefore

111
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:43,620
C next to ten

112
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,800
that's nine

113
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:49,759
that's four

114
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,759
okay Seven Ten nine okay

115
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,600
yeah okay okay so what's your thought so

116
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,520
if I give you the numbers what's your

117
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,759
song what's your strategy

118
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,220
obviously you better Die slow

119
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:07,620
fast

120
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:11,699
yes we can prove us that

121
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:14,880
each number here for I for I

122
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:17,340
in wrench

123
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:22,139
n right and N is the number of elements

124
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:24,720
for J in range size for K in range J we

125
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:26,880
pick three different numbers and then we

126
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,819
check if it forms the triangle right so

127
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,919
let's open cubic okay

128
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:34,259
something that's good why do we need to

129
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:38,960
stop if we thought what happened we if

130
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:38,960
we thought then we have this 10 9

131
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,560
okay so once we have this increasing

132
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:54,120
order so how do we check we do the top

133
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,000
three

134
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,560
very close we do the top three oh okay

135
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
so we check this one

136
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,919
bro

137
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,419
it works it was how do we check it

138
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:08,759
bigger than ten right bigger than 10.

139
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:10,440
that's good if we can form a triangle

140
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:12,600
using these three numbers we just return

141
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,600
it why can we return it closed

142
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,600
captioning not available

143
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,539
it has to be least requirement has to be

144
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,180
satisfied for any A and B in the

145
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:57,500
Triangle okay if the smallest two

146
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:57,500
numbers are bigger than the

147
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,580
so we we come from a time that usually

148
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:15,120
what do we do yeah move back and then

149
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:17,520
now what do we do now we check

150
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,199
nine is bigger than seven why not nice

151
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,280
the peak is the side you know triangle

152
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,039
five plus

153
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,840
seven seven bigger than nine then it

154
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,419
forms a triangle and we return at least

155
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,360
the sum of these three okay

156
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:35,940
yeah

157
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:39,419
one two two three five okay so look

158
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:41,459
we sold it right so two three five can

159
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:42,620
we form a triangle

160
00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:46,260
um

161
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:48,080
okay we move back two plus two can we

162
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:51,600
find yes yes

163
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,540
okay that's it yeah so so the numbers if

164
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,820
it's a okay

165
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:58,740
the times n is the number of elements in

166
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,480
the array okay this is sorting increase

167
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:04,380
in order okay then we can solve the

168
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:08,700
reverse order so for I in range

169
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:11,459
n minus 3 minus y minus one so we start

170
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:15,839
from there we start from this

171
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:16,680
to this I start from uh the third to the

172
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,420
last

173
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:23,519
going back to the first and then we

174
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:26,940
check if a i this one plus a i plus one

175
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:30,720
this one is bigger than a i plus two

176
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:33,180
right then we return return the sum of

177
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,160
of these three okay otherwise will

178
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:37,260
return 0 at the end right the time

179
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:41,160
complexity oh and okay because this is

180
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:44,540
dominating this is o n oh and again o n

181
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,540
log n plus n

182
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:50,880
why this is bigger than this so we

183
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:53,300
ignore the trivia part right our login

184
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:57,420
is more dominating okay

185
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:59,580
so why do we need to check only if the

186
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:01,500
smallest two numbers the sum of the

187
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:04,620
smallest two numbers added together if

188
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:06,540
it's bigger than a bigger one

189
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:09,959
I we just

190
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:13,560
need plus nine is is it bigger than the

191
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:16,140
third number if this is because because

192
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:21,120
no matter what it is

193
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:23,459
it's still if it isn't that means it's

194
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,700
not but if it is too

195
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:28,560
yeah but if it is that means the way it

196
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,600
is that's right yeah because look these

197
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,339
two are smallest if the two smallest

198
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,240
number add it together then the third

199
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:37,200
one

200
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:38,580
then every island pairs means this

201
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,220
requirement because these two are the

202
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:44,459
smallest right look seven plus now you

203
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:46,380
bigger than ten obviously seven plus ten

204
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:48,839
is bigger than nine right because look

205
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:52,140
seven plus nine ten is bigger than nine

206
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:54,060
right so I choose a bigger one and these

207
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,380
become smaller so on the left side is

208
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:57,420
increasing on the right side is

209
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:58,500
decreasing so obviously it works right

210
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,540
yeah

211
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,100
yeah okay what have you learned today

212
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:04,800
come on that's it

213
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:07,200
um perimeter of the triangle can you

214
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:10,260
describe a little bit more and then you

215
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,420
have a list of numbers yeah we have at

216
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:14,399
least some integers positive integers as

217
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:17,279
the size of each triangle and then what

218
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:21,440
are we trying to do and we want to try

219
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:24,959
to find out the maximum

220
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:27,899
right okay so how do we solve somebody

221
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:29,420
so we started yeah we saw it and then

222
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:31,920
increase in order

223
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:35,040
so that's the thing is that we continue

224
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,120
so we created to try the largest three

225
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,660
numbers

226
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:43,459
right and here we find the valley

227
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:43,459
triangle okay so one question

228
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:52,500
can use this why don't we don't need to

229
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:54,839
check any pairs on the left hand side

230
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:57,000
because they're smaller they're smaller

231
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,260
exactly because we're sorting it seven

232
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,700
plus nine

233
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:02,579
and ten

234
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:05,399
this is the valid triangle the largest

235
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:07,680
we have seen so far there is no point to

236
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:09,600
check one plus five five plus seven

237
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,700
right because five plus seven is smaller

238
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,579
than seven plus nine all right yes yes

239
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:16,320
okay there we go two come on parameter

240
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:18,300
and the largest parameter of the

241
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:22,740
triangle and so

242
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:26,279
so we have cheese three three and five

243
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:28,800
and we we are we have a list of numbers

244
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:34,200
and we have to

245
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:35,339
put bananas label label the size

246
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,339
size

247
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:37,339
um

248
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:47,040
how long live and and so so first we

249
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:51,800
smoked it and

250
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:55,160
and we are gonna what TV

251
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,160
oh my God

252
00:12:55,399 --> 00:13:02,579
three maximum

253
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:04,800
because because there's no points doing

254
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:08,399
this one before

255
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:11,760
but because they're too because they're

256
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:14,339
they're smaller obviously smaller than

257
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:17,220
the ones at the end after you saw them

258
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:17,880
unless if you're unless you thought it

259
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:23,339
wrong

260
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:26,820
but and so if you if it doesn't add

261
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:31,320
up bigger than the third number then we

262
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:33,899
backwards yeah then we backwards

263
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:35,880
yeah move it move the window the window

264
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:39,420
of the size three move it to the back

265
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:43,220
yeah yeah yeah and until you find it and

266
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:43,220
if you can't find it then the

267
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,579
thank you that's it for today bye bye
