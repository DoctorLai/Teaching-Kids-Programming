1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,080
hello

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:06,160
hello mr eric mr ryan how are you today

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,600
have you had a good weekend today okay

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,080
sit down

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,080
okay so today we are going to talk about

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,120
uh you know we want to count the number

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,560
of pairs with the as the root difference

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,800
equal to k

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,199
so you're given a number a raise of the

10
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,080
a list of numbers like one

11
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,080
two

12
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,080
two one okay

13
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,119
a list of numbers let's say

14
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,599
one

15
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,199
and okay let's say equals to one okay so

16
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,719
by the way what's what's the that's the

17
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,280
real difference do you still remember

18
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,399
this function abs

19
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,320
x

20
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,360
mathematics

21
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,160
okay

22
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,040
yeah what's this x

23
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,040
yes

24
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,399
x for x this is the same these two are

25
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,879
same

26
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:57,199
okay this is mathematics and this is the

27
00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:01,760
way we do the coding we use as

28
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,760
absx let's still remember this

29
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,640
is x

30
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,560
if

31
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,479
x bigger than zero

32
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:13,680
zero if

33
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:15,840
x equals zero is minus x if x minus zero

34
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,159
okay so basically it's uh

35
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,840
it's uh the distance

36
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,159
this function returns the distance

37
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,799
between x to the zero right

38
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,040
so let's say this is five so what's the

39
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,119
abs five

40
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,720
what's the abs five five five units

41
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,920
what's the abs

42
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,360
minus two minus two j yeah you see you

43
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,520
got the difference yeah

44
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,280
okay so um

45
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,320
so can you count the number of pairs the

46
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:45,119
pairs yeah two numbers yeah two numbers

47
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,880
with the difference equals to k

48
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,040
e y which is one can you find two

49
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,399
numbers basically finding two numbers

50
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:55,200
which has the difference one

51
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,960
one two and two one one two and two one

52
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,240
yeah but we also don't find the pairs we

53
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,000
have a good job

54
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,280
we want to find the pairs

55
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,119
what's pairs

56
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,240
pairs yes pairs

57
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:08,640
so look one two yeah so if we find two

58
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,599
pairs which are not which has sequence

59
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,319
like uh

60
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:11,840
uh

61
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,760
you know one two and two one it's the

62
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,239
same right so we only pick

63
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,959
one two the from the big uh smallest and

64
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:21,760
index to the bigger and you do this yeah

65
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,040
one two yeah of course look so look one

66
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,080
two

67
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,520
one two

68
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,000
one two

69
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,120
two one two one okay so there are four

70
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,120
pairs yeah

71
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,360
but one two two one it's the same okay

72
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,840
we only pick one right yeah so basically

73
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,000
if you pick a

74
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,319
i and j

75
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,040
this is the same as aj you should not

76
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,440
pick it twice yeah this is the same

77
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,879
yeah this is the sense

78
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,480
yeah

79
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,400
it should be easier with the proof of

80
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,080
thing right with the proof version yeah

81
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,760
should we write it

82
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,040
the proof of things thing how to prove

83
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,599
what's the pair so remember what's the

84
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,000
term complexity how to to blue first

85
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,800
appearance

86
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,959
and

87
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,120
square we're down well good job o n

88
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,360
square because we proof was the i right

89
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,879
the index and the proof of the j right

90
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,480
and then we just check the difference if

91
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,440
it's okay then we incrementalize it

92
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,040
right

93
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:19,040
easy peasy right let me squeeze me

94
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:21,440
my badge yeah i'm going to find the

95
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:24,159
i need more oh this one is good okay so

96
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,159
let's do this

97
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,360
all right

98
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,440
define

99
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:35,200
find a call let's do it

100
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,200
card okay count pairs

101
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,239
that's a and k okay

102
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:43,120
first of all we need to know the length

103
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,040
of the a length of the pairs

104
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,120
length of the numbers so

105
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,280
how do we get the lens

106
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,560
and equal as well

107
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,560
length of the array the number

108
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,040
length

109
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,720
at the beginning where you guys were

110
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,720
zero

111
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,840
and then we start from the second inner

112
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,879
loop for j

113
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:18,160
in range

114
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,359
i to n right and then look if

115
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,199
abs

116
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,160
my absolute function at the distance

117
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,840
yeah

118
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,560
i i

119
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,880
minus a j

120
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,880
equal

121
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,720
you see this is very easy yeah simple

122
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,720
easy peasy too for loop starting the

123
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,919
blue forcing let the computer to try the

124
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,000
index from zero to n minus one and then

125
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,680
when we have this i we we need a

126
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,160
computer to try

127
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,759
like uh the j index from i to n minus

128
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,199
one and we check the numbers the

129
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,720
distance between these two numbers if

130
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,120
it's equal scale and we increment our

131
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,000
answer look this is all n and this is o

132
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,680
n

133
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,320
if you're doing one thing you need all

134
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,120
in one step and inside each n step you

135
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:09,039
need to do another n step so the

136
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,560
condenses to multiply together is o n

137
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,120
square right yeah what's the space

138
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,880
complexity

139
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,680
are we using any space oh well we're

140
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,280
done

141
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,880
okay so

142
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,120
you know oil square

143
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:24,720
not fast we can come up with better so

144
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,560
look for this one one two two one right

145
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,240
so how about if i have a counter

146
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,199
remember account that the counter the

147
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,120
number of each unique items and their

148
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,560
appearance right so if you count them

149
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:39,120
what's the out if dc is counter list

150
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,720
so what do we have for this d

151
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,639
one what

152
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,639
the key is one the value is one

153
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,440
okay and that

154
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,680
c is two the unit how many times they

155
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:55,360
appear

156
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,039
okay so look the one appears two times

157
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,960
the one appears two times i know there

158
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,400
are two ones here and i know there are

159
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,000
two tools here

160
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,919
right two is here

161
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,639
so look

162
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:09,840
so if i do this one i know it's one

163
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:12,720
right and what's one plus one

164
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:15,600
okay so now i'm at the number one so i

165
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:18,000
know the difference of k is one plus one

166
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,800
right so two is two counts okay so i

167
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,840
have

168
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,400
i have one two times and i have two two

169
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,520
times so how many pairs are they going

170
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,880
to get

171
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,319
two two

172
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,919
this there are two options here and

173
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,880
there are two options here so how many

174
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,960
four yeah two thumbs up so look we just

175
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,639
counted that's it

176
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,560
yeah we use the counter and then we

177
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,000
count it right

178
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,680
okay i'm going to write it and then you

179
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,680
tell me what's the time the rest here

180
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,720
so look first of all we need to see

181
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,160
object c equals counter one

182
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,840
i don't know what we want to count the

183
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,919
number of elements in a so a we're done

184
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:59,199
and then now i have this answer and the

185
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:00,319
steel equals zero yeah so for

186
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,199
i

187
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,560
in

188
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,919
c okay for i in c is going to the unique

189
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,319
numbers yeah

190
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:10,560
all the all you can do for i in c dot

191
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,400
keys is the same yeah for i in c or c

192
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,360
dot p all c

193
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,520
is still the same yeah okay

194
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,120
lambda one answer

195
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,639
plus equal

196
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,639
yeah look

197
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:26,639
we know i c i appears

198
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,039
this is the number of times c i appears

199
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:32,960
yeah and we want to find out the i plus

200
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:35,360
k c i plus k this is the number of times

201
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,800
it appears so what should i do with this

202
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,280
should i put

203
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,039
what what operator should i put here

204
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,120
come on

205
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,199
i have this is one

206
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,599
this is the two

207
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,000
the number of times two appears this is

208
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:52,560
the number of time one appears

209
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,479
so i should put

210
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,479
what did i talk about what was i talking

211
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:59,199
about the number of one appears two

212
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:02,400
times the number of

213
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:04,319
two appears two times so how many pairs

214
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,800
how many pairs times you multiply

215
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,639
together okay so you also you can do

216
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,319
this as well because it goes through the

217
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,639
c so you can also

218
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:16,479
make it c minus k is the same yeah

219
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:18,240
because c minus uh i minus k

220
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:21,039
has the distance

221
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,160
k to i right the distance okay so it's

222
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,919
the same yeah

223
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,960
and then return what

224
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,160
answer

225
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:30,319
what's the time complexity for this one

226
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,640
all right yeah it's a single loop c the

227
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,080
keys appears

228
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,839
see

229
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,760
a mouse and items

230
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,399
values yeah oh n what's a space

231
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,399
complexity

232
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,560
yeah okay

233
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:48,000
yeah so how beautiful is that we use

234
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,839
this we use we trade the space

235
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,279
yeah we trade the time with the space

236
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,399
yeah

237
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:58,320
so we use the space to make it faster

238
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,320
this is linear this is quadratic

239
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,880
square

240
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,279
make it linear linear

241
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,279
this

242
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,279
okay

243
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,279
okay so look

244
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,040
this one we can use the counter oh oh we

245
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,120
can do this counting one by one yeah we

246
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:22,080
can count it one by one instead of these

247
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,959
we can do this look this is uh

248
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,959
this is another way of uh doing it but

249
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,040
it's quite similar similar it's similar

250
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:32,320
yeah we use the default dictionary yeah

251
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,680
look what's definition

252
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,040
integer

253
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,800
and then instead of going through the

254
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,880
dictionary because now dictionaries and

255
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,800
then we go into the original numbers

256
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:44,160
which is a

257
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,880
and then i just needs to do what

258
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,480
i now i just need to answer

259
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,279
plus

260
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,399
equal the c i

261
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:57,600
c i minus k okay and then i i also need

262
00:09:54,399 --> 00:10:00,320
to check the answer c i plus k

263
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,839
because d c i minus k and c i plus k are

264
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:06,320
two numbers on with k

265
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:08,880
distance on the both sides of the eye

266
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:12,000
look if this is i right if it is this

267
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:14,480
side what what two numbers are

268
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,480
have as a root difference k with this

269
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,480
number

270
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,440
which two numbers have difference k

271
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,600
to this i

272
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,480
come on the absolute difference remember

273
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,519
absolute difference okay

274
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,760
i

275
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:40,720
plus k yeah and what's here i minus k

276
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,959
yeah the k unit yeah this is k unit okay

277
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,000
that's the difference then edit and now

278
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:49,120
because i'm at least a i so i need to

279
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,600
see i what i need to i have

280
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,959
i have seen one number i so i need to

281
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,920
what ci1

282
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,720
minus

283
00:10:53,920 --> 00:11:00,720
xci is the count plus equal

284
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,079
one yeah and then we can

285
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,040
what's the time complexity for this one

286
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,040
what's the time complexity

287
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,000
yeah what's the time going to say come

288
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,279
on

289
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,519
all right what's the space complexity

290
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:16,000
yeah it's the same it's the same as the

291
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,560
previous one okay

292
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,839
yeah easy yeah so which one you think is

293
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,839
better oh also

294
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,040
oh and then this one

295
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,920
yeah you understand

296
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,600
yeah so if i erase any two can you can

297
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,959
you write it

298
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,560
that's three

299
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,959
okay so what

300
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,600
the other second one which one you have

301
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:41,600
three notes maybe that one is easier you

302
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,600
look c equals counter you tell me what

303
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,839
to do okay counter a

304
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,680
for i you're going through this counter

305
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,639
then what answer what

306
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:53,519
plus equal one and return answer

307
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:56,519
also plus equals c

308
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,519
i

309
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,160
c i plus k yeah all c i minus k is the

310
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,399
same yeah

311
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,560
in this case because they see we only

312
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:09,760
counting ones right we're only counting

313
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,519
ones so look if two the k difference we

314
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,240
can count

315
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:17,360
we can count the pair two three or if k

316
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,200
equals one we can count two three or

317
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,959
two one this is the same we only

318
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,600
counting it once yeah if you count the

319
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:26,160
two twice then that will be duplicated

320
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,880
and we are saying that we only count it

321
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,680
once and like one two we only count it

322
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,760
one two not two one okay this is the

323
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,480
same pairs okay that's it for today good

324
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:39,800
job bye bye

325
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,800
bye bye
