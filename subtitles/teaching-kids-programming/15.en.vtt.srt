all right look ryan
if this is a tree the depth is this this

34
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:15,840
if this is a tree the depth is this this
 

35
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,870
if this is a tree the depth is this this
dimension yeah

36
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:16,880
dimension yeah
 

37
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,149
dimension yeah
this is the depth right the breast is

38
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:20,159
this is the depth right the breast is
 

39
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,030
this is the depth right the breast is
this dimension

40
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:21,040
this dimension
 

41
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,070
this dimension
horizontally so it's broad horizontal

42
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:24,080
horizontally so it's broad horizontal
 

43
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,510
horizontally so it's broad horizontal
breath so look if this is the tree like

44
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:27,520
breath so look if this is the tree like
 

45
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,710
breath so look if this is the tree like
this is a

46
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:28,720
this is a
 

47
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,910

do you get it so you will travel level
 

61
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,630
do you get it so you will travel level
by level

62
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:52,640

 

63
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,550

65
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,749

it goes this way can you take a guess a

66
00:02:01,749 --> 00:02:01,759
it goes this way can you take a guess a
 

67
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,030
it goes this way can you take a guess a

visit the e
 

81
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,869
visit the e
and then go back go back c and f g

82
00:02:22,869 --> 00:02:22,879
and then go back go back c and f g
 

83
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,470
and then go back go back c and f g
okay yeah that's d f s so what is

84
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:26,480
okay yeah that's d f s so what is
 

85
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,790
okay yeah that's d f s so what is
how does that have so look that's an

86
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:28,800
how does that have so look that's an
 

87
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,390
how does that have so look that's an
interesting problem today

88
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:30,400
interesting problem today
 

89
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,710
interesting problem today
yeah that's an interesting problem let's

90
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:32,720
yeah that's an interesting problem let's
 

91
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,150
yeah that's an interesting problem let's
say

92
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:34,160
say

yeah one means that this point you can

118
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:17,920
yeah one means that this point you can
 

119
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,309
yeah one means that this point you can
jump

120
00:03:18,309 --> 00:03:18,319
jump
 

121
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,430
jump
forward one or jump backwards one

122
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:21,440
forward one or jump backwards one
 

123
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,630
forward one or jump backwards one
right

124
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:24,640

 

125
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,430

that's okay zero is the destination

126
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:27,440
that's okay zero is the destination
 

127
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,509
that's okay zero is the destination
target destination yeah

128
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:31,519

 

129
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,630

so yeah everyone you're here and you can

130
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:34,640
so yeah everyone you're here and you can
 

131
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,110
so yeah everyone you're here and you can
go this way or go this way one step

132
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:37,120
go this way or go this way one step
 

133
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,830
go this way or go this way one step
right

134
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:37,840
right
 

135
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,350
right
if you go this way if you're here

136
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:41,360
if you go this way if you're here
 

137
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,070
if you go this way if you're here
then you can choose go three step more

138
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:44,080
then you can choose go three step more
 

139
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,830
then you can choose go three step more
but there's no more so you can't go that

140
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:45,840
but there's no more so you can't go that
 

141
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,589
but there's no more so you can't go that
way but you can jump backwards with that

142
00:03:47,589 --> 00:03:47,599
way but you can jump backwards with that
 

143
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,190
way but you can jump backwards with that
one two three and then you

144
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:49,200
one two three and then you
 

145
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,630
one two three and then you
reach the destination oh yeah but if you

146
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:52,640
reach the destination oh yeah but if you
 

147
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,270
reach the destination oh yeah but if you
if you

148
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:53,280
if you
 

149
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,990
if you
here if you go to here then you can jump

150
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,000
here if you go to here then you can jump
 

151
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,470
here if you go to here then you can jump
straight

152
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:56,480
straight
 

153
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,190
straight
forward one two three yeah and then you

154
00:03:59,190 --> 00:03:59,200
forward one two three yeah and then you
 

155
00:03:59,200 --> 00:03:59,670
forward one two three yeah and then you
can do

156
00:03:59,670 --> 00:03:59,680
can do
 

157
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,309
can do
one two three four or you can do three

158
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:02,319
one two three four or you can do three
 

159
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,190
one two three four or you can do three
four three more

160
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:03,200
four three more
 

161
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,350
four three more
you can do three yeah because you are at

162
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:05,360
you can do three yeah because you are at
 

163
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,789
you can do three yeah because you are at
three then you can jump forward or

164
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:06,799
three then you can jump forward or
 

165
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:07,670
three then you can jump forward or
backwards right

166
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:07,680
backwards right
 

167
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,910
backwards right
yeah okay so this is an interesting

168
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:09,920
yeah okay so this is an interesting
 

169
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,670
yeah okay so this is an interesting
problem so given

problem so given
given a list at least this is the list

172
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:15,599
given a list at least this is the list
 

173
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,030
given a list at least this is the list
so we call it uh

174
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:19,040

 

175
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,030

then okay let's just call it n this is

176
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:21,040
then okay let's just call it n this is
 

177
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,390
then okay let's just call it n this is
the list and then

178
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:22,400
the list and then
 

179
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,150
the list and then
you have starting point position as s

180
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:26,160
you have starting point position as s
 

181
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,590
you have starting point position as s
okay and then you want to find out

182
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:29,600
okay and then you want to find out
 

183
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,710
okay and then you want to find out
you want to find out if you can if you

184
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:32,720
you want to find out if you can if you
 

185
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,590
you want to find out if you can if you
can reach the zero

186
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:35,600
can reach the zero
 

187
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,110
can reach the zero
by this way yeah

188
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:39,120
by this way yeah
 

189
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,030
by this way yeah
it's interesting this is an interesting

190
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,040
it's interesting this is an interesting
 

191
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,189
it's interesting this is an interesting
one okay so how do we do this

192
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:43,199
one okay so how do we do this
 

193
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,430
one okay so how do we do this

remember remember so we have a queue
 

199
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,110
remember remember so we have a queue
yeah can you remind me what is the queue

200
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:57,120
yeah can you remind me what is the queue
 

201
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,790
yeah can you remind me what is the queue
every line what is the queue

202
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:02,800

00:05:43,749 --> 00:05:43,759
tell me how many next position can we
 

235
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:44,390
tell me how many next position can we
have

236
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:44,400
have
 

237
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,110
have
we take the three up and what's the next

238
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:47,120
we take the three up and what's the next
 

239
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:56,390
we take the three up and what's the next
position could be

240
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:56,400

 

241
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,590

yeah and then this one yeah so it could

242
00:05:59,590 --> 00:05:59,600
yeah and then this one yeah so it could
 

243
00:05:59,600 --> 00:05:59,990
yeah and then this one yeah so it could
be

244
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,000
be
 

245
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,150
be
these would be four and five right okay

246
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:04,160
these would be four and five right okay
 

247
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,870
these would be four and five right okay
right now

248
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:08,880

 

249
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,590

right yeah because we could choose this

250
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:11,600
right yeah because we could choose this
 

251
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,189
right yeah because we could choose this
way and this way right

252
00:06:13,189 --> 00:06:13,199
way and this way right
 

253
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,029
way and this way right
one yeah right so now we take the

254
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:17,039
one yeah right so now we take the
 

255
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,469
one yeah right so now we take the
beginning which is four

256
00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:18,479
beginning which is four
 

257
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,749
beginning which is four
what's the four which is which is uh

258
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:21,759
what's the four which is which is uh
 

259
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:27,350
what's the four which is which is uh
four for the next position will be

260
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:27,360

 

261
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,350

if i'm here what's the next position it

262
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:29,360
if i'm here what's the next position it
 

263
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,110
if i'm here what's the next position it
could be it can't be over

264
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:31,120
could be it can't be over
 

265
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,390
could be it can't be over
the boundary so it can be only this way

266
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:34,400
the boundary so it can be only this way
 

267
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:34,950
the boundary so it can be only this way
yeah yeah

268
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:34,960
yeah yeah
 

269
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,270
yeah yeah
so that will be zero a block would be

270
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:37,280
so that will be zero a block would be
 

271
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,070
so that will be zero a block would be
one

272
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:38,080
one
 

273
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,189
one
and then then and

274
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:43,199

 

275
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,189

two three yes two one

00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:47,199
two three yes two one
 

277
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,309
two three yes two one
and then two two is here so we can have

278
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:50,319
and then two two is here so we can have
 

279
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,589
and then two two is here so we can have
uh

280
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:51,599
uh
 

281
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,460

one two three not one
sorry which one four it isn't one

288
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:02,000
sorry which one four it isn't one
 

289
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,150
sorry which one four it isn't one
83 it can't go this way right so it

290
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:06,160
83 it can't go this way right so it
 

291
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,350
83 it can't go this way right so it
could be

292
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:07,360
could be
 

293
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,270
could be
let's we are here on another three step

294
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:09,280
let's we are here on another three step
 

295
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,350
let's we are here on another three step
one two three so that's zero one

296
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:11,360
one two three so that's zero one
 

297
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,670
one two three so that's zero one
that's the one i mean one index one this

298
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:13,680
that's the one i mean one index one this
 

299
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,550
that's the one i mean one index one this
is in that one

300
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:14,560
is in that one
 

301
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,710
is in that one
and then i take a two what's the next

302
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:16,720
and then i take a two what's the next
 

303
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,189
and then i take a two what's the next
zero one two it could be

304
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:19,199
zero one two it could be
 

305
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,830
zero one two it could be
three two two two more uh three more

306
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:21,840
three two two two more uh three more
 

307
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,029
three two two two more uh three more
that would be five

308
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:23,039
that would be five
 

309
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,029
that would be five
and then three less will be nothing

310
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:25,039
and then three less will be nothing
 

311
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,629
and then three less will be nothing
right so i put it one

312
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:26,639
right so i put it one
 

313
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,990
right so i put it one
five okay and then one yeah

okay at the beginning now one
 

323
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,870
okay at the beginning now one
look we have a kill every time we take

324
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:42,880
look we have a kill every time we take
 

325
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,550
look we have a kill every time we take
the beginning of the queue

326
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:44,560
the beginning of the queue
 

327
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,830
the beginning of the queue
and push its next step either

328
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:47,840
and push its next step either
 

329
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,029
and push its next step either
forward or backward into the queue

330
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:51,039
forward or backward into the queue
 

331
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,150
forward or backward into the queue
right until we one of the items in the

332
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:54,160
right until we one of the items in the
 

333
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:54,550
right until we one of the items in the

queue
 

335
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,070
queue
or we reach we find the one

336
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:58,080
or we reach we find the one
 

337
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,510
or we reach we find the one
which is zero that's our target y

338
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:01,520
which is zero that's our target y
 

339
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,950
which is zero that's our target y
zero one plus two which one

340
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:04,960
zero one plus two which one
 

341
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,869
zero one plus two which one
y zero one you want to download one

342
00:08:08,869 --> 00:08:08,879
y zero one you want to download one
 

343
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,150
y zero one you want to download one
index that's the index zero

344
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:12,160
index that's the index zero
 

345
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,990
index that's the index zero
1 that's the index that's the current

346
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:14,000
1 that's the index that's the current
 

347
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,749
1 that's the index that's the current
position

348
00:08:15,749 --> 00:08:15,759
position
 

349
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,110
position
okay this is the let's say index

350
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:19,120
okay this is the let's say index
 

351
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,469
okay this is the let's say index
and n n 1

352
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:22,479
and n n 1
 

353
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:27,189
and n n 1
n 1 will be 0 okay we are looking for

354
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:27,199
n 1 will be 0 okay we are looking for
 

355
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,390
n 1 will be 0 okay we are looking for
the destination zero

356
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:30,400
the destination zero
 

357
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,350
the destination zero
so we i let me write it down then you

358
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:33,360
so we i let me write it down then you
 

359
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,190
so we i let me write it down then you
can have a look

360
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:35,200
can have a look
 

361
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,870
can have a look
and i will have a few blanks for you to

362
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:38,880
and i will have a few blanks for you to
 

363
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,670
and i will have a few blanks for you to
guess

364
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:39,680
guess
 

365
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,790
guess
what okay that's so first of all that

366
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:42,800
what okay that's so first of all that
 

367
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,470
what okay that's so first of all that
yeah definitely b

368
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:46,480
yeah definitely b
 

369
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,509
yeah definitely b
f s we've taken a number

370
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:49,519
f s we've taken a number
 

371
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,670
f s we've taken a number
and a list of numbers at least the

372
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:51,680
and a list of numbers at least the
 

373
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,870
and a list of numbers at least the
number and the starting position

374
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:54,880
number and the starting position
 

375
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,990
number and the starting position
what's what am i missing here that's a

376
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:58,000
what's what am i missing here that's a
 

377
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,110
what's what am i missing here that's a
good job

378
00:08:59,110 --> 00:08:59,120
good job
 

379
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,310
good job
so now we have a keo

380
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:02,320
so now we have a keo
 

381
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,829
so now we have a keo
which is bracket empty

382
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:06,839

 

383
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,190

right if

384
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:11,200

 

385
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,750

first of all we check if and if land if

386
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:13,760
first of all we check if and if land if
 

387
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,430
first of all we check if and if land if
the given

388
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:15,440
the given
 

389
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,190
the given
length is empty then we return

390
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:19,200
length is empty then we return
 

391
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,230
length is empty then we return
we just return false right we just we

392
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:22,240
we just return false right we just we
 

393
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,910
we just return false right we just we
say it's not possible

394
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:23,920
say it's not possible
 

395
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,790
say it's not possible
return first it's not possible okay

396
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:26,800
return first it's not possible okay
 

397
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,630
return first it's not possible okay
otherwise

398
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:28,640
otherwise
 

399
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,470
otherwise
otherwise we we put

400
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:32,480
otherwise we we put
 

401
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,710
otherwise we we put
actually actually we can move this layer

402
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:36,720
actually actually we can move this layer
 

403
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,030
actually actually we can move this layer
i already written down that that's okay

404
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,040
i already written down that that's okay
 

405
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,870
i already written down that that's okay
that's okay you can keep it that's okay

406
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:40,880
that's okay you can keep it that's okay
 

407
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,590
that's okay you can keep it that's okay
q equals the first step is

408
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:45,600

 

409
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,750

the first first of all we pull us s into

410
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:47,760
the first first of all we pull us s into
 

411
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,269
the first first of all we pull us s into
the q right we'll put s

412
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:49,279
the q right we'll put s
 

413
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,590
the q right we'll put s
into the q so this is there's only one

414
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:51,600
into the q so this is there's only one
 

415
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,070
into the q so this is there's only one
item in the queue

416
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:54,080
item in the queue
 

417
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,110
item in the queue
so now

418
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,120

 

419
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,110

now we we need to say y

420
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:01,120
now we we need to say y
 

421
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,150
now we we need to say y
length the q is not empty

422
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:04,160
length the q is not empty
 

423
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,150
length the q is not empty
right this means that the q is not empty

424
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:06,160
right this means that the q is not empty
 

425
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,230
right this means that the q is not empty
there's still elements in the queue

426
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:08,240
there's still elements in the queue
 

427
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,550
there's still elements in the queue
we take the first element so the current

428
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:10,560
we take the first element so the current
 

429
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,990
we take the first element so the current
step will be

430
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:12,000
step will be
 

431
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,750
step will be
uh let's say now let's put it now

432
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:15,760
uh let's say now let's put it now
 

433
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,110
uh let's say now let's put it now
equals dot pop zero

434
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:19,120
equals dot pop zero
 

435
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,269
equals dot pop zero
right remember we use the top zero to

436
00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:21,279
right remember we use the top zero to
 

437
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,269
right remember we use the top zero to
pop the first element in the

438
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:23,279
pop the first element in the
 

439
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,310
pop the first element in the
remember this remember if i

440
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:26,320
remember this remember if i
 

441
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,590
remember this remember if i
let the q is one two and then look if

442
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:29,600
let the q is one two and then look if
 

443
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,790
let the q is one two and then look if
it's one two and q

444
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:30,800
it's one two and q
 

445
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,829
it's one two and q
dot pop 0 we'll take this away

446
00:10:33,829 --> 00:10:33,839
dot pop 0 we'll take this away
 

447
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,870
dot pop 0 we'll take this away
and then now we'll become one okay let's

448
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:36,880
and then now we'll become one okay let's
 

449
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,590
and then now we'll become one okay let's
go pop zero

450
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:41,600

 

451
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,630

sorry i haven't seen the one now that's

452
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:44,640
sorry i haven't seen the one now that's
 

453
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,069
sorry i haven't seen the one now that's
the variable you can call it

454
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:46,079
the variable you can call it
 

455
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,790

is at this position and then what should

468
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:05,600
is at this position and then what should
 

469
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,630
is at this position and then what should
we do we should check

470
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:06,640
we do we should check
 

471
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,670
we do we should check
if the next position which is do we need

472
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:09,680
if the next position which is do we need
 

473
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,790
if the next position which is do we need
the support

474
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:10,800
the support
 

475
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,150
the support
no no no there's no stuff

476
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:14,160
no no no there's no stuff
 

477
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,190
no no no there's no stuff
you know in person every every line has

478
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:17,200
you know in person every every line has
 

479
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,110
you know in person every every line has
only one statement you can use the

480
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:19,120
only one statement you can use the
 

481
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,550
only one statement you can use the
what's this

482
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:22,560

 

483
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,790

semicolon for example you can say a

484
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:24,800
semicolon for example you can say a
 

485
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,389
semicolon for example you can say a
equals one and semicolon b

486
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:26,399
equals one and semicolon b
 

487
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,910
equals one and semicolon b
equals one it's the same as a equals one

488
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:29,920
equals one it's the same as a equals one
 

489
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,269
equals one it's the same as a equals one
new line b equals one or is also the

490
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:33,279
new line b equals one or is also the
 

491
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:33,910
new line b equals one or is also the
same as

492
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:33,920
same as
 

493
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,269
same as
a b equals one one okay there's three

494
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:37,279
a b equals one one okay there's three
 

495
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,910
a b equals one one okay there's three
different ways of doing it

496
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:39,920
different ways of doing it
 

497
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,670
different ways of doing it
so here

498
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:43,680
so here
 

499
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,150
so here
remember if we are at this position and

500
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:46,160
remember if we are at this position and
 

501
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,590
remember if we are at this position and
we can jump

502
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:47,600
we can jump
 

503
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,550
we can jump
jump three steps more or get both go

504
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:50,560
jump three steps more or get both go
 

505
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,590
jump three steps more or get both go
back swing for step

506
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:51,600
back swing for step
 

507
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,030
back swing for step
right we are eric ryan is here

508
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:55,040
right we are eric ryan is here
 

509
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,670
right we are eric ryan is here
and then the next partition will be er

510
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:57,680
and then the next partition will be er
 

511
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,230
and then the next partition will be er
plus

512
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:58,240
plus
 

513
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,430
plus
n n

514
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:01,440
n n
 

515
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,269
n n
uh so now this is er the er plus

516
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:05,279
uh so now this is er the er plus
 

517
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,310
uh so now this is er the er plus
n er right right

518
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:08,320
n er right right
 

519
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,670
n er right right
and all er minus and er

520
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:11,680
and all er minus and er
 

521
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,389
and all er minus and er
so there are two positions to go so we

522
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:14,399
so there are two positions to go so we
 

523
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,350
so there are two positions to go so we
can do this is

524
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:15,360
can do this is
 

525
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,629
can do this is
4 i

526
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:18,639
4 i
 

527
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,269
4 i
in because it could be plus or equal

528
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:21,279
in because it could be plus or equal
 

529
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,069
in because it could be plus or equal
right

530
00:12:22,069 --> 00:12:22,079
right
 

531
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,750
right
minus 1 plus one

532
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:25,760

 

533
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,710

if it's plus one it means that to go

534
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:28,720
if it's plus one it means that to go
 

535
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,670
if it's plus one it means that to go
forward

536
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:29,680
forward
 

537
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,910
forward
if minus one is go to backward and the

538
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:31,920
if minus one is go to backward and the
 

539
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,629
if minus one is go to backward and the
next position next let's call it next

540
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:34,639
next position next let's call it next
 

541
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,150
next position next let's call it next
equals now would be er right

542
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:38,160
equals now would be er right
 

543
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,190
equals now would be er right
we are everything ryan is at er position

544
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:41,200
we are everything ryan is at er position
 

545
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,590
we are everything ryan is at er position
and then the next position will be i

546
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:43,600
and then the next position will be i
 

547
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,629
and then the next position will be i
times

548
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:44,639
times
 

549
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,710
times
because it's plus 1 or minus 1 times

550
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:46,720
because it's plus 1 or minus 1 times
 

551
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,629
because it's plus 1 or minus 1 times
what times n

552
00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:48,639
what times n
 

553
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,310
what times n
er right

554
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:52,320
er right
 

555
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,230
er right
yeah now let's but again we need to

556
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:54,240
yeah now let's but again we need to
 

557
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,829
yeah now let's but again we need to
check the position here

558
00:12:55,829 --> 00:12:55,839
check the position here
 

559
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,710
check the position here
so so i'm keeping writing down that way

560
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:58,720
so so i'm keeping writing down that way
 

561
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,870
so so i'm keeping writing down that way
okay okay then if

562
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:00,880
okay okay then if
 

563
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,389
okay okay then if
if if what er

564
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:04,399
if if what er
 

565
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:09,030
if if what er
if next next bigger than zero

566
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:09,040
if next next bigger than zero
 

567
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,629
if next next bigger than zero
and next

568
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:12,639
and next
 

569
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,389
and next
smaller than equals then length

570
00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:16,399
smaller than equals then length
 

571
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,629
smaller than equals then length
m right because it can't go smaller

572
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:18,639
m right because it can't go smaller
 

573
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,389
m right because it can't go smaller
equals and smaller than lens

574
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:20,399
equals and smaller than lens
 

575
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,269
equals and smaller than lens
because it can't go beyond the boundary

576
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:23,279
because it can't go beyond the boundary
 

577
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,470
because it can't go beyond the boundary
then we need to push

578
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:26,480

 

579
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:32,829

q dot push q dot append

580
00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:32,839

 

581
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:36,069

next okay so there's a slightly tiny

582
00:13:36,069 --> 00:13:36,079
next okay so there's a slightly tiny
 

583
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:36,949
next okay so there's a slightly tiny
problem here

584
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:36,959
problem here
 

585
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,990
problem here
look look what even away is here right

586
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:40,000
look look what even away is here right
 

587
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,030
look look what even away is here right
uh if it's not currently is one if it

588
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:43,040
uh if it's not currently is one if it
 

589
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:43,990
uh if it's not currently is one if it
all one

590
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:44,000
all one
 

591
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,350
all one
right look if ei is here

592
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:47,360
right look if ei is here
 

593
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,030
right look if ei is here
now we're pushing we're jumping

594
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:51,040

 

595
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,269

one step forward right but the next time

596
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:53,279
one step forward right but the next time
 

597
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,949
one step forward right but the next time
you could be jumping backward again

598
00:13:54,949 --> 00:13:54,959
you could be jumping backward again
 

599
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,629
you could be jumping backward again
right and then you're jumping forward

600
00:13:56,629 --> 00:13:56,639
right and then you're jumping forward
 

601
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,310
right and then you're jumping forward
backward backward forward

602
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:58,320
backward backward forward
 

603
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,829
backward backward forward
so you see the loop right it means that

604
00:14:01,829 --> 00:14:01,839
so you see the loop right it means that
 

605
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,030
so you see the loop right it means that
so we need to check if

606
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:03,040
so we need to check if
 

607
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,670
so we need to check if
this if that step we already visited

608
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:05,680
this if that step we already visited
 

609
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,189
this if that step we already visited
then we don't jump because we have

610
00:14:07,189 --> 00:14:07,199
then we don't jump because we have
 

611
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:07,590
then we don't jump because we have
jumped

612
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:07,600
jumped
 

613
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,870
jumped
before right otherwise you if this

614
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:10,880
before right otherwise you if this
 

615
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,829
before right otherwise you if this
one if ever gets here ryan is here

616
00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:13,839
one if ever gets here ryan is here
 

617
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,350
one if ever gets here ryan is here
you're jumping forward

618
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:15,360
you're jumping forward
 

619
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,110
you're jumping forward
and then you're jumping backward coming

620
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:17,120
and then you're jumping backward coming
 

621
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,389
and then you're jumping backward coming
forward jump backwards

622
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:18,399
forward jump backwards
 

623
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,389
forward jump backwards
forward yeah i know

624
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:22,399
forward yeah i know
 

625
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,430
forward yeah i know
you never end right so we need to avoid

626
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:25,440
you never end right so we need to avoid
 

627
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,230
you never end right so we need to avoid
the situation like that so we have this

628
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:28,240
the situation like that so we have this
 

629
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:28,629
the situation like that so we have this
uh

630
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:28,639
uh
 

631
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,870
uh
scene let's call it scene are you

632
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:30,880
scene let's call it scene are you
 

633
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,949
scene let's call it scene are you
kidding me

634
00:14:32,949 --> 00:14:32,959
kidding me
 

635
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,189
kidding me
that's why i left a space here i've seen

636
00:14:35,189 --> 00:14:35,199
that's why i left a space here i've seen
 

637
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,350
that's why i left a space here i've seen
or we called it visited all members

638
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:37,360
or we called it visited all members
 

639
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,150
or we called it visited all members
and we call it as a dictionary right

640
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:40,160
and we call it as a dictionary right
 

641
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,910
and we call it as a dictionary right
maybe we call it the set remember we

642
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:41,920
maybe we call it the set remember we
 

643
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,790
maybe we call it the set remember we
call it the set

644
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:42,800
call it the set
 

645
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,150
call it the set
and

646
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:46,160

 

647
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,230

so so so what's next so look

648
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:50,240
so so so what's next so look
 

649
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,990
so so so what's next so look
here if next we need to we need to

650
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:54,000
here if next we need to we need to
 

651
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,110
here if next we need to we need to
add here right we need to add a add

652
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:57,120
add here right we need to add a add
 

653
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,310
add here right we need to add a add
something here right

654
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:58,320
something here right
 

655
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,670
something here right
okay i'm going to write here okay so if

656
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:01,680
okay i'm going to write here okay so if
 

657
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,470
okay i'm going to write here okay so if
if seen if next

658
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:06,480

 

659
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,189

next in sin

660
00:15:11,189 --> 00:15:11,199
next in sin
 

661
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:15,030
next in sin
so if not next not in scene okay if next

662
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:15,040
so if not next not in scene okay if next
 

663
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:15,910
so if not next not in scene okay if next
not in scene

664
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:15,920
not in scene
 

665
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,310
not in scene
then we do this then we can add this

666
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:18,320
then we do this then we can add this
 

667
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,269
then we do this then we can add this
scene dot

668
00:15:19,269 --> 00:15:19,279
scene dot
 

669
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,470
scene dot
add next so this

670
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:22,480
add next so this
 

671
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,269
add next so this
will avoid us to repeatedly jumping

672
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:25,279
will avoid us to repeatedly jumping
 

673
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,550
will avoid us to repeatedly jumping
backward and forward backward and

674
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:26,560
backward and forward backward and
 

675
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,750
backward and forward backward and
forward

676
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:27,760
forward
 

677
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,509
forward
okay and then where do we check

678
00:15:31,509 --> 00:15:31,519
okay and then where do we check
 

679
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,509
okay and then where do we check
if they're already there so look if er

680
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:35,519
if they're already there so look if er
 

681
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,069
if they're already there so look if er
er is right if we are currently at this

682
00:15:38,069 --> 00:15:38,079
er is right if we are currently at this
 

683
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:38,710
er is right if we are currently at this
position

684
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:38,720
position
 

685
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,230
position
we added one more here if n

686
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:42,240
we added one more here if n
 

687
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,350
we added one more here if n
er equals zero

688
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:45,360
er equals zero
 

689
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,470
er equals zero
means we already do it right return true

690
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:48,480
means we already do it right return true
 

691
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,829
means we already do it right return true
do we have a space here yes yes and then

692
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:51,839
do we have a space here yes yes and then
 

693
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,150
do we have a space here yes yes and then
otherwise after this while loop what do

694
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:54,160
otherwise after this while loop what do
 

695
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,629
otherwise after this while loop what do
we do return what

696
00:15:56,629 --> 00:15:56,639
we do return what
 

697
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,150
we do return what
can you tell me what was your return

698
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:58,160
can you tell me what was your return
 

699
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,389
can you tell me what was your return
here false yes because

700
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:00,399
here false yes because
 

701
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,509
here false yes because
if if we are writing out of choice

702
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:03,519
if if we are writing out of choice
 

703
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,990
if if we are writing out of choice
we return first is it clear

704
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:08,000
we return first is it clear
 

705
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,629
we return first is it clear
this is very interesting problem yeah

706
00:16:10,629 --> 00:16:10,639
this is very interesting problem yeah
 

707
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:11,670
this is very interesting problem yeah
