[Music]

4
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:04,960
[Music]
 

5
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,510
[Music]
today we're going to talk about uh

6
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:07,520
today we're going to talk about uh
 

7
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,589
today we're going to talk about uh
converting a sorted list to find a

8
00:00:09,589 --> 00:00:09,599
converting a sorted list to find a
 

9
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,070
converting a sorted list to find a
research tree so can you remind me what

10
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:12,080
research tree so can you remind me what
 

11
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,070
research tree so can you remind me what
is finally search tree

12
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:14,080
is finally search tree
 

13
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,349
is finally search tree
bsd is a tree yeah it's the final it's a

14
00:00:17,349 --> 00:00:17,359
bsd is a tree yeah it's the final it's a
 

15
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,790
bsd is a tree yeah it's the final it's a
tree it's a binary tree

16
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:20,800

 

17
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,990

uh it has numbers yeah it has

18
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:24,000
uh it has numbers yeah it has
 

19
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,029
uh it has numbers yeah it has
numbers they're in circles

20
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:27,039
numbers they're in circles
 

21
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,550
numbers they're in circles
so what if this is four this is

22
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:30,560
so what if this is four this is
 

23
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,350
so what if this is four this is
three and this is five and then this is

24
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:33,360
three and this is five and then this is
 

25
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,470
three and this is five and then this is
two

26
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:34,480
two
 

27
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,110
two
and then this is four point five maybe

28
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:37,120
and then this is four point five maybe
 

29
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,310
and then this is four point five maybe
this is seven

30
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:38,320
this is seven
 

31
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,590
this is seven
so do you get this do you get it the

32
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:41,600
so do you get this do you get it the
 

33
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,190
so do you get this do you get it the
final research tree

34
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:43,200
final research tree
 

35
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,830
final research tree
first of all it's the final tree yeah

36
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:45,840
first of all it's the final tree yeah
 

37
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,910
first of all it's the final tree yeah
and the other left nodes are smaller

38
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:47,920
and the other left nodes are smaller
 

39
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,110
and the other left nodes are smaller
than the root

40
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:49,120
than the root
 

41
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,910
than the root
all the right nodes are bigger than the

42
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:51,920
all the right nodes are bigger than the
 

43
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,670
all the right nodes are bigger than the
loose so you can search it

44
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:53,680
loose so you can search it
 

45
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,389
loose so you can search it
yeah like if i want to search two i can

46
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:56,399
yeah like if i want to search two i can
 

47
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,069
yeah like if i want to search two i can
go to the left side because it's smaller

48
00:00:58,069 --> 00:00:58,079
go to the left side because it's smaller
 

49
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,430
go to the left side because it's smaller
than four right

50
00:00:59,430 --> 00:00:59,440
than four right
 

51
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,869
than four right
and it's all getting smaller than three

52
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:00,879
and it's all getting smaller than three
 

53
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,630
and it's all getting smaller than three
and then i go through this side yes

54
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:02,640
and then i go through this side yes
 

55
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,189
and then i go through this side yes
so if you do perform and in order

56
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:05,199
so if you do perform and in order
 

57
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,030
so if you do perform and in order
remember what's in order so

58
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:07,040
remember what's in order so
 

59
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,230
remember what's in order so
in order to traverse up

60
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:10,240
in order to traverse up
 

61
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,429
in order to traverse up
in order if i if i visit

62
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:13,439
in order if i if i visit
 

63
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,070
in order if i if i visit
the left note first and then i reach the

64
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:16,080
the left note first and then i reach the
 

65
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,109
the left note first and then i reach the
root note and then

66
00:01:17,109 --> 00:01:17,119
root note and then
 

67
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,510
root note and then
visit right now so what you will give

68
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:19,520
visit right now so what you will give
 

69
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,149
visit right now so what you will give
give us

70
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:20,159
give us
 

71
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,190
give us
is a sorted list am right yeah because i

72
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:23,200
is a sorted list am right yeah because i
 

73
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,350
is a sorted list am right yeah because i
always visit the smaller nodes

74
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:25,360
always visit the smaller nodes
 

75
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,830
always visit the smaller nodes
and the current nose and the bigger nose

76
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:27,840
and the current nose and the bigger nose
 

77
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,390
and the current nose and the bigger nose
so this is an assaulted

78
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:30,400
so this is an assaulted
 

79
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,990
so this is an assaulted
order right yes do you get it

80
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:34,000
order right yes do you get it
 

81
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,510
order right yes do you get it
yeah okay so now today yes

82
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:37,520
yeah okay so now today yes
 

83
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,550
yeah okay so now today yes
do you get it

84
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:40,560
do you get it
 

85
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,469
do you get it
today we talked about assaulting this

86
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:42,479
today we talked about assaulting this
 

87
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,069
today we talked about assaulting this
remember something this like

88
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:44,079
remember something this like
 

89
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,190
remember something this like
one two three four

90
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:47,200
one two three four
 

91
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,710
one two three four
five six six seven eight so if i

92
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:50,720
five six six seven eight so if i
 

93
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,350
five six six seven eight so if i
want you to convert it to a binary

94
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:53,360
want you to convert it to a binary
 

95
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,069
want you to convert it to a binary
surgery

96
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:54,079
surgery
 

97
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,469
surgery
obviously you can convert it using many

98
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:56,479
obviously you can convert it using many
 

99
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,310
obviously you can convert it using many
uh there are many ways right

100
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:58,320
uh there are many ways right
 

101
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,069
uh there are many ways right
so how about if i tell you that i want

102
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:00,079
so how about if i tell you that i want
 

103
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,910
so how about if i tell you that i want
to you convert it with

104
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:01,920
to you convert it with
 

105
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,870
to you convert it with
to a balanced final surgery or minimum

106
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:04,880
to a balanced final surgery or minimum
 

107
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:13,780
to a balanced final surgery or minimum
height you know balance such

108
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:13,790

 

109
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:20,790

[Music]

110
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:20,800

 

111
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,030

binary means that uh at any note

112
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:25,040
binary means that uh at any note
 

113
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,750
binary means that uh at any note
that the difference between the depths

114
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:27,760
that the difference between the depths
 

115
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,070
that the difference between the depths
of

116
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:28,080
of
 

117
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,949
of
two subtrees are always smaller or equal

118
00:02:30,949 --> 00:02:30,959
two subtrees are always smaller or equal
 

119
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:31,990
two subtrees are always smaller or equal
than one so it's

120
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:32,000
than one so it's
 

121
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,070
than one so it's
balanced this is not balanced look this

122
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:34,080
balanced this is not balanced look this
 

123
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,110
balanced this is not balanced look this
is not balanced

124
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:35,120
is not balanced
 

125
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,070
is not balanced
right you can obviously you can please

126
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:38,080
right you can obviously you can please
 

127
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:38,869
right you can obviously you can please
and

128
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:38,879
and
 

129
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,710
and
one two three four five like a link list

130
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:42,720
one two three four five like a link list
 

131
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,030
one two three four five like a link list
yeah

132
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,040
yeah
 

133
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,430
yeah
look this is the final three final

134
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:45,440
look this is the final three final
 

135
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,470
look this is the final three final
research three

136
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:46,480
research three
 

137
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,190
research three
it is also a linked list yeah but it's

138
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:49,200
it is also a linked list yeah but it's
 

139
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,070
it is also a linked list yeah but it's
not parents

140
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:50,080
not parents
 

141
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,670
not parents
right it's not parents yeah it's

142
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:51,680
right it's not parents yeah it's
 

143
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,430
right it's not parents yeah it's
territory yeah do you get it

144
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:53,440
territory yeah do you get it
 

145
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,229
territory yeah do you get it
so the the complexity of searching

146
00:02:58,229 --> 00:02:58,239
so the the complexity of searching
 

147
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,710
so the the complexity of searching
in in a balance in the binary search

148
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:00,720
in in a balance in the binary search
 

149
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,390
in in a balance in the binary search
tree in the worst case is o

150
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:02,400
tree in the worst case is o
 

151
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,949
tree in the worst case is o
n right because you you're not making

152
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:04,959
n right because you you're not making
 

153
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,550
n right because you you're not making
use of the fact that uh

154
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:06,560
use of the fact that uh
 

155
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,470
use of the fact that uh
you're making the balance if it's

156
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:08,480
you're making the balance if it's
 

157
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,750
you're making the balance if it's
balanced then you can say

158
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:09,760
balanced then you can say
 

159
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,190
balanced then you can say
it's o what one o log n

160
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:13,200
it's o what one o log n
 

161
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,229
it's o what one o log n
yeah yeah if if it's not balanced in the

162
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:16,239
yeah yeah if if it's not balanced in the
 

163
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,670
yeah yeah if if it's not balanced in the
worst case if it leads then it's over

164
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:19,680
worst case if it leads then it's over
 

165
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,309
worst case if it leads then it's over
yeah we're done okay so now given this

166
00:03:22,309 --> 00:03:22,319
yeah we're done okay so now given this
 

167
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,190
yeah we're done okay so now given this
sorted

00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:23,200
sorted
 

169
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,670
sorted
sorted list how can we convert it to a

170
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:25,680
sorted list how can we convert it to a
 

171
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,390
sorted list how can we convert it to a
binary

172
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:26,400
binary
 

173
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,149
binary
balance binary search tree

174
00:03:30,149 --> 00:03:30,159

 

175
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,470

i think how about if we take the current

176
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:34,480
i think how about if we take the current
 

177
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,830
i think how about if we take the current
which no i if i take it as a route

178
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:37,840
which no i if i take it as a route
 

179
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,270
which no i if i take it as a route
the one in the middle

180
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:43,280

 

181
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,110

okay so look at three or four it doesn't

182
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:45,120
okay so look at three or four it doesn't
 

183
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,630
okay so look at three or four it doesn't
matter yet because they're too long

184
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:46,640
matter yet because they're too long
 

185
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,309
matter yet because they're too long
three okay i pick three so now

186
00:03:50,309 --> 00:03:50,319
three okay i pick three so now
 

187
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,429
three okay i pick three so now
all the notes before it are smaller than

188
00:03:53,429 --> 00:03:53,439
all the notes before it are smaller than
 

189
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,229
all the notes before it are smaller than
three right so it goes on the left three

190
00:03:56,229 --> 00:03:56,239
three right so it goes on the left three
 

191
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:56,550
three right so it goes on the left three
yeah

192
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:56,560
yeah
 

193
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,270
yeah
it goes these two goes here right i've

194
00:03:59,270 --> 00:03:59,280
it goes these two goes here right i've
 

195
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,550
it goes these two goes here right i've
got a big

196
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:00,560
got a big
 

197
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,710
got a big
thing yeah yeah i know look and every

198
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:02,720
thing yeah yeah i know look and every
 

199
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,390
thing yeah yeah i know look and every
nose after three

200
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:04,400
nose after three
 

201
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,429
nose after three
goes well

202
00:04:07,429 --> 00:04:07,439

 

203
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,350

right on the right yeah we're done look

204
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:09,360
right on the right yeah we're done look
 

205
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,470
right on the right yeah we're done look
it's on the right

206
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:10,480
it's on the right
 

207
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,429
it's on the right
so again it's on the right look again we

208
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:13,439
so again it's on the right look again we
 

209
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,149
so again it's on the right look again we
are dividing

210
00:04:14,149 --> 00:04:14,159
are dividing
 

211
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,030
are dividing
this into two sub problems right for

212
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:17,040
this into two sub problems right for
 

213
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,830
this into two sub problems right for
these two and

214
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:17,840
these two and
 

215
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,710
these two and
one and two right we again can pick one

216
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:20,720
one and two right we again can pick one
 

217
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,909
one and two right we again can pick one
in the middle and then do this

218
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:21,919
in the middle and then do this
 

219
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:23,510
in the middle and then do this
recursively and for this

220
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:23,520
recursively and for this
 

221
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,510
recursively and for this
four five six for example pick one in

222
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:25,520
four five six for example pick one in
 

223
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,550
four five six for example pick one in
the middle which is

224
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:26,560
the middle which is
 

225
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,030
the middle which is
five five okay then i put a five here

226
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:29,040
five five okay then i put a five here
 

227
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,230
five five okay then i put a five here
and then

228
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:30,240
and then
 

229
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,150
and then
put a five okay so now we are dealing

230
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,160
put a five okay so now we are dealing
 

231
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,670
put a five okay so now we are dealing
with five five

232
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:33,680
with five five
 

233
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,230
with five five
four goes on the left hand side of the

234
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:36,240
four goes on the left hand side of the
 

235
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:36,870
four goes on the left hand side of the
five right

236
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:36,880
five right
 

237
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,749
five right
and six yeah right yeah you see so we're

238
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:39,759
and six yeah right yeah you see so we're
 

239
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:40,710
and six yeah right yeah you see so we're
building it

240
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:40,720
building it
 

241
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,030
building it
look yeah yeah so what's the complexity

242
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:45,040
look yeah yeah so what's the complexity
 

243
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,510
look yeah yeah so what's the complexity
if you do

244
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:45,520
if you do
 

245
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,909
if you do
if i w1

246
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:49,919

 

247
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,230

in what cases you need to tell me it's a

248
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:52,240
in what cases you need to tell me it's a
 

249
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,350
in what cases you need to tell me it's a
what one constant is like

250
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:55,360
what one constant is like
 

251
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,670
what one constant is like
compared to the sum of the first n

252
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:57,680
compared to the sum of the first n
 

253
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,390
compared to the sum of the first n
numbers you

254
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:58,400
numbers you
 

255
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,870
numbers you
you have equation right yeah and you

256
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:00,880
you have equation right yeah and you
 

257
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,150
you have equation right yeah and you
don't need to iterate

258
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:02,160
don't need to iterate
 

259
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,909
don't need to iterate
over the numbers you can just do do a

260
00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:05,919
over the numbers you can just do do a
 

261
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,990
over the numbers you can just do do a
mathematics equation that's all one okay

262
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:08,000
mathematics equation that's all one okay
 

263
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,189
mathematics equation that's all one okay
that's the only time

264
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:09,199
that's the only time
 

265
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,710
that's the only time
you need to tell me is the one for this

266
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:10,720
you need to tell me is the one for this
 

267
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,629
you need to tell me is the one for this
one is o and why because we need to

268
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:12,639
one is o and why because we need to
 

269
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,270
one is o and why because we need to
visit

270
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:13,280
visit
 

271
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,310
visit
we need to use n numbers in the sorted

272
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:16,320
we need to use n numbers in the sorted
 

273
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,029
we need to use n numbers in the sorted
array

274
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:17,039
array
 

275
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,670
array
to make a list okay to make a tree so

276
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:19,680
to make a list okay to make a tree so
 

277
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,350
to make a list okay to make a tree so
now

278
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:21,360
now
 

279
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,710
now
so now let's do this defy

280
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:24,720
so now let's do this defy
 

281
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,830
so now let's do this defy
okay let's just call it uh fear

282
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:29,840
okay let's just call it uh fear
 

283
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,950
okay let's just call it uh fear
bst what's bst

284
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:32,960
bst what's bst
 

285
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,830
bst what's bst
uh binary such tree okay and then let's

286
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:35,840
uh binary such tree okay and then let's
 

287
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,870
uh binary such tree okay and then let's
go in numbers

288
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:36,880
go in numbers
 

289
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,550
go in numbers
we are sorting this is thought number

290
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:38,560
we are sorting this is thought number
 

291
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,749
we are sorting this is thought number
and what's missing there

292
00:05:41,749 --> 00:05:41,759

 

293
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,670

yes okay that is if the length of the

294
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:45,680
yes okay that is if the length of the
 

295
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,189
yes okay that is if the length of the
number

296
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:47,199
number
 

297
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,550
number
is zero then we need to return one

298
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:50,560
is zero then we need to return one
 

299
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,550
is zero then we need to return one
return now

300
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:54,560

 

301
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,270

okay we need to find the meter in the

302
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:57,280
okay we need to find the meter in the
 

303
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,309
okay we need to find the meter in the
middle okay so what's

304
00:05:58,309 --> 00:05:58,319
middle okay so what's
 

305
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,189
middle okay so what's
what's the one in the index is mid

306
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:01,199
what's the one in the index is mid
 

307
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:01,670
what's the one in the index is mid
equals

308
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:01,680
equals
 

309
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,950
equals
length dams divided by 10

310
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:04,960
length dams divided by 10
 

311
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,590
length dams divided by 10
yeah divided by two let's see roughly in

312
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:07,600
yeah divided by two let's see roughly in
 

313
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,309
yeah divided by two let's see roughly in
the middle yeah

314
00:06:08,309 --> 00:06:08,319
the middle yeah
 

315
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,629
the middle yeah
not exactly in the middle sometimes if

316
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:10,639
not exactly in the middle sometimes if
 

317
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,909
not exactly in the middle sometimes if
you have four numbers what's in the

318
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:11,919
you have four numbers what's in the
 

319
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,510
you have four numbers what's in the
middle you can pick the

320
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:13,520
middle you can pick the
 

321
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,790
middle you can pick the
second one or the third one yeah yeah

322
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:16,800
second one or the third one yeah yeah
 

323
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,830
second one or the third one yeah yeah
roughly as long as roughly in the middle

324
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:19,840
roughly as long as roughly in the middle
 

325
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,790
roughly as long as roughly in the middle
okay so now

326
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:20,800
okay so now
 

327
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,990
okay so now
roughly now we we pick here the root

328
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,000
roughly now we we pick here the root
 

329
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,550
roughly now we we pick here the root
which is three three now again we put

330
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:26,560
which is three three now again we put
 

331
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,590
which is three three now again we put
the tree now

332
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:27,600
the tree now
 

333
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,749
the tree now
which is the the one in the middle so

334
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:29,759
which is the the one in the middle so
 

335
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,390
which is the the one in the middle so
which one is put in the middle

336
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:32,400
which one is put in the middle
 

337
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,510
which one is put in the middle
lambs meat right yeah yeah

338
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:35,520
lambs meat right yeah yeah
 

339
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,990
lambs meat right yeah yeah
because any number is in the middle so

340
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:38,000
because any number is in the middle so
 

341
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,070
because any number is in the middle so
now we have the loot of this value right

342
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,080
now we have the loot of this value right
 

343
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,550
now we have the loot of this value right
now we need to recursively construct the

344
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:42,560
now we need to recursively construct the
 

345
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,189
now we need to recursively construct the
speed

346
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:43,199
speed
 

347
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,309
speed
and then we spin okay so the

348
00:06:46,309 --> 00:06:46,319
and then we spin okay so the
 

349
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,629
and then we spin okay so the
the peak on the left so we can say loot

350
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:48,639
the peak on the left so we can say loot
 

351
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:49,830
the peak on the left so we can say loot
dot left

352
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:49,840
dot left
 

353
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,110
dot left
equals beard pst f we because we

354
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:53,120
equals beard pst f we because we
 

355
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,029
equals beard pst f we because we
call it yeah yeah i am looking

356
00:06:57,029 --> 00:06:57,039
call it yeah yeah i am looking
 

357
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,070
call it yeah yeah i am looking
okay the numbers now we need to take the

358
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:00,080
okay the numbers now we need to take the
 

359
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,990
okay the numbers now we need to take the
numbers between look one two three

360
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:02,000
numbers between look one two three
 

361
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,710
numbers between look one two three
four five now the meter is three yeah we

362
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:04,720
four five now the meter is three yeah we
 

363
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,790
four five now the meter is three yeah we
need to take the numbers before three so

364
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:06,800
need to take the numbers before three so
 

365
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,830
need to take the numbers before three so
we can use

366
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:07,840
we can use
 

367
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,670
we can use
lamps look look this one bracket

368
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:11,680
lamps look look this one bracket
 

369
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,589
lamps look look this one bracket
and column anything up to

370
00:07:15,589 --> 00:07:15,599
and column anything up to
 

371
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,790
and column anything up to
meat yeah the meat is the index yeah

372
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:18,800
meat yeah the meat is the index yeah
 

373
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,550
meat yeah the meat is the index yeah
so look there must need

374
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:22,560
so look there must need
 

375
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,909
so look there must need
and then lose the right again

376
00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:25,919
and then lose the right again
 

377
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,230
and then lose the right again
we can build it yeah because we build it

378
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:30,240
we can build it yeah because we build it
 

379
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,070
we can build it yeah because we build it
so how do we take the numbers after

380
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:32,080
so how do we take the numbers after
 

381
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,070
so how do we take the numbers after
three look you can do these

382
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:34,080
three look you can do these
 

383
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,070
three look you can do these
lumps one thing meat plus one okay

384
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:38,080
lumps one thing meat plus one okay
 

385
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,309
lumps one thing meat plus one okay
meat plus one so start from meat plus

386
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:40,319
meat plus one so start from meat plus
 

387
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,430
meat plus one so start from meat plus
one

388
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:41,440
one
 

389
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,430
one
column that's it you don't need to

390
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:43,440
column that's it you don't need to
 

391
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,550
column that's it you don't need to
specify the grains

392
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:44,560
specify the grains
 

393
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,390
specify the grains
actually look you numbs from

394
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:48,400
actually look you numbs from
 

395
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,070
actually look you numbs from
column 2 so this 2 is not

396
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,080
column 2 so this 2 is not
 

397
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,670
column 2 so this 2 is not
is it's not equal right for example 1 to

398
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:55,680
is it's not equal right for example 1 to
 

399
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,510
is it's not equal right for example 1 to
3 it will be one two not including three

400
00:07:59,510 --> 00:07:59,520
3 it will be one two not including three
 

401
00:07:59,520 --> 00:07:59,909
3 it will be one two not including three
okay

402
00:07:59,909 --> 00:07:59,919
okay
 

403
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,189
okay
up to three not including yeah so from

404
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:03,199
up to three not including yeah so from
 

405
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,550
up to three not including yeah so from
from anything up to mid not included

406
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:06,560
from anything up to mid not included
 

407
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,029
from anything up to mid not included
mean

408
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:07,039
mean
 

409
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,270
mean
from mid plus one up to the end not

410
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:09,280
from mid plus one up to the end not
 

411
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,070
from mid plus one up to the end not
including n

412
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,080
including n
 

413
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,350
including n
yeah that's okay so then this is

414
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:13,360
yeah that's okay so then this is
 

415
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,790
yeah that's okay so then this is
nums need plus one yeah

416
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:16,800
nums need plus one yeah
 

417
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,070
nums need plus one yeah
and then we turn what we answer

418
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,080
and then we turn what we answer
 

419
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,390
and then we turn what we answer
wait yeah we are building this little

420
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:22,400
wait yeah we are building this little
 

421
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,230
wait yeah we are building this little
note

422
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:24,240
note
 

423
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,350
note
okay so that's it let's see uh how we

424
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:27,360
okay so that's it let's see uh how we
 

425
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,710
okay so that's it let's see uh how we
building this tea

426
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:28,720
building this tea
 

427
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,709
building this tea
and can you tell me how many recursions

428
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:32,719
and can you tell me how many recursions
 

429
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,389
and can you tell me how many recursions
are there

430
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:34,399
are there
 

431
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,790
are there
again i asking i'm asking this question

432
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:36,800
again i asking i'm asking this question
 

433
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,990
again i asking i'm asking this question
again three

434
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:38,000
again three
 

435
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,110
again three
weighs three where's three why do we two

436
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:41,120
weighs three where's three why do we two
 

437
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,509
weighs three where's three why do we two
yes building the left tree and building

438
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:43,519
yes building the left tree and building
 

439
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,110
yes building the left tree and building
the right tree look we divide this

440
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:45,120
the right tree look we divide this
 

441
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,269
the right tree look we divide this
problem into two small sub problems

442
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:47,279
problem into two small sub problems
 

443
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,310
problem into two small sub problems
which again we can recursively build it

444
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:50,320
which again we can recursively build it
 

445
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,470
which again we can recursively build it
right this is building and for a

446
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:52,480
right this is building and for a
 

447
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,949
right this is building and for a
recursion to work we need to specify the

448
00:08:54,949 --> 00:08:54,959
recursion to work we need to specify the
 

449
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,790
recursion to work we need to specify the
terminal condition which is

450
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:56,800
terminal condition which is
 

451
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,470
terminal condition which is
if we don't specify this what will

452
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:58,480
if we don't specify this what will
 

453
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,150
if we don't specify this what will
happen you are

454
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:00,160
happen you are
 

455
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,269
happen you are
in in differently calling itself itself

456
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:03,279
in in differently calling itself itself
 

457
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,070
in in differently calling itself itself
is there and

458
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:04,080
is there and
 

459
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,110
is there and
but it doesn't know how to stop right

460
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:07,120
but it doesn't know how to stop right
 

461
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,750
but it doesn't know how to stop right
am right if you don't specify this then

462
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:09,760
am right if you don't specify this then
 

463
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,910
am right if you don't specify this then
you call yourself again itself you say

464
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:11,920
you call yourself again itself you say
 

465
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,670
you call yourself again itself you say
itself until computer dies do you get it

466
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:15,680
itself until computer dies do you get it
 

467
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,670
itself until computer dies do you get it
yeah so we need to tell you if the

468
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:17,680
yeah so we need to tell you if the
 

469
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,190
yeah so we need to tell you if the
number is empty then

470
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:19,200
number is empty then
 

471
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,470
number is empty then
you just give me a noun right

472
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:22,480
you just give me a noun right
 

473
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,070
you just give me a noun right
then you will stop that and it will come

474
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:24,080
then you will stop that and it will come
 

475
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,829
then you will stop that and it will come
back you will build it build

476
00:09:25,829 --> 00:09:25,839
back you will build it build
 

477
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,949
back you will build it build
this building step by step you get it

478
00:09:28,949 --> 00:09:28,959
this building step by step you get it
 

479
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,230
this building step by step you get it
yeah this is top bottom top button from

480
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:32,240
yeah this is top bottom top button from
 

481
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,150
yeah this is top bottom top button from
the top bottom recursion yeah

482
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:34,160
the top bottom recursion yeah
 

483
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,470
the top bottom recursion yeah
look we pick we pick the one in the

484
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:36,480
look we pick we pick the one in the
 

485
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,269
look we pick we pick the one in the
middle

486
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:37,279
middle
 

487
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,230
middle
right yeah we pick the one in the middle

488
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:40,240
right yeah we pick the one in the middle
 

489
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:40,710
right yeah we pick the one in the middle
then

490
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:40,720
then
 

491
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,190
then
we know because we salted this we know

492
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:43,200
we know because we salted this we know
 

493
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,389
we know because we salted this we know
the left three

494
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:44,399
the left three
 

495
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,350
the left three
the nose are before this meter now right

496
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:47,360
the nose are before this meter now right
 

497
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,430
the nose are before this meter now right
