four plus five plus six is uh
 

41
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,910
four plus five plus six is uh
divided by how many three yeah that's i

42
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:27,920
divided by how many three yeah that's i
 

43
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,270
divided by how many three yeah that's i
already so you just tell me

44
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:29,280
already so you just tell me
 

45
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,789
already so you just tell me
it's a sum yes it's a sum 15

46
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:32,799
it's a sum yes it's a sum 15
 

47
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,550
it's a sum yes it's a sum 15
divided by yeah it's a sum divided by

48
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:36,560
divided by yeah it's a sum divided by
 

49
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,510
divided by yeah it's a sum divided by
count okay let's average what simple as

50
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:39,520
count okay let's average what simple as
 

51
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,270
count okay let's average what simple as
that

52
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:41,280
that
 

53
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,910
that
yeah yeah yes okay so so given a number

54
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:43,920
yeah yeah yes okay so so given a number
 

55
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,310
yeah yeah yes okay so so given a number
like

56
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:44,320
like
 

57
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,069
like
like one two three a list of number ten

58
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:48,079
like one two three a list of number ten
 

59
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,830
like one two three a list of number ten
right

60
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:49,840
right
 

61
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,950
right
and i want you to tell me if it's

62
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:52,960
and i want you to tell me if it's
 

63
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,990
and i want you to tell me if it's
possible to

64
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:54,000
possible to
 

65
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,590
possible to
remove one number from the list

66
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:57,600
remove one number from the list
 

67
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,630
remove one number from the list
and the rest number the remember

68
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:00,640
and the rest number the remember
 

69
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,990
and the rest number the remember
that the rest numbers the average will

70
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:04,000
that the rest numbers the average will
 

71
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,190
that the rest numbers the average will
be

72
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:05,200
be
 

73
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,869
be
two that's the target will be

74
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:08,879
two that's the target will be
 

75
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,910
two that's the target will be
wait how many numbers can we use so they

76
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:11,920
wait how many numbers can we use so they
 

77
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,110
wait how many numbers can we use so they
have to be only

78
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,120
have to be only
 

79
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,830
have to be only
allowed to take one number so we remove

80
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:15,840
allowed to take one number so we remove
 

81
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,110
allowed to take one number so we remove
one of the numbers

82
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:17,120
one of the numbers
 

83
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,910
one of the numbers
and then the the remaining numbers have

84
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:19,920
and then the the remaining numbers have
 

85
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,110
and then the the remaining numbers have
everything

86
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:23,120

 

87
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,350

yeah because one two three the sum is

88
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:25,360
yeah because one two three the sum is
 

89
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,790
yeah because one two three the sum is
six divided by

90
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:26,800
six divided by
 

91
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,309
six divided by
how many two three yeah so the original

92
00:02:30,309 --> 00:02:30,319
how many two three yeah so the original
 

93
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,949
how many two three yeah so the original
has four numbers but we take one out

94
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:32,959
has four numbers but we take one out
 

95
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,949
has four numbers but we take one out
so the remaining will be three numbers

96
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:34,959
so the remaining will be three numbers
 

97
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,949
so the remaining will be three numbers
okay so this is how to work it out

98
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:36,959
okay so this is how to work it out
 

99
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,229
okay so this is how to work it out
so you find how many numbers for this

100
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:40,239
so you find how many numbers for this
 

101
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,270
so you find how many numbers for this
example is

102
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:41,280
example is
 

103
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,990
example is
four and then if you take away one that

104
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:44,000
four and then if you take away one that
 

105
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,869
four and then if you take away one that
means

106
00:02:44,869 --> 00:02:44,879
means
 

107
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,830
means
there have to be three and you do um

108
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:47,840
there have to be three and you do um
 

109
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,869
there have to be three and you do um
something

110
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:48,879
something
 

111
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,270
something
divided by three equals two and then you

112
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:51,280
divided by three equals two and then you
 

113
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,550
divided by three equals two and then you
need to find

114
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:52,560
need to find
 

115
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,470
need to find
then two times three equals six and then

116
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:54,480
then two times three equals six and then
 

117
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,990
then two times three equals six and then
you need to find a sum which

118
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:56,000
you need to find a sum which
 

119
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,190
you need to find a sum which
equals six okay interesting interesting

120
00:02:59,190 --> 00:02:59,200
equals six okay interesting interesting
 

121
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,990
equals six okay interesting interesting
yeah i'm not

122
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:00,000
yeah i'm not
 

123
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,390
yeah i'm not
exactly following you but i kind of

124
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:02,400
exactly following you but i kind of
 

125
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,589
exactly following you but i kind of
understand what it means

126
00:03:03,589 --> 00:03:03,599
understand what it means
 

127
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,110
understand what it means
but look so we given at least

128
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:07,120
but look so we given at least
 

129
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,830
but look so we given at least
at least a number yeah a number and now

130
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:09,840
at least a number yeah a number and now
 

131
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,670
at least a number yeah a number and now
we have a target

132
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:11,680
we have a target
 

133
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,550
we have a target
a target so you need to tell me if it's

134
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:14,560
a target so you need to tell me if it's
 

135
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,229
a target so you need to tell me if it's
possible to remove one

136
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:16,239
possible to remove one
 

137
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,110
possible to remove one
number to make the remaining numbers

138
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:19,120
number to make the remaining numbers
 

139
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,430
number to make the remaining numbers
have

140
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:19,440
have
 

141
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,229
have
average target return two or five right

142
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:22,239
average target return two or five right

possibilities of that
 

157
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,070
possibilities of that
if there are any numbers i think it's

158
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:42,080

 

159
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,509

say so n because you need to take away

160
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:45,519
say so n because you need to take away
 

161
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:46,070
say so n because you need to take away
one

162
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:46,080
one
 

163
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,190
one
and then you know okay so how so

164
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:49,200
and then you know okay so how so
 

165
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,350
and then you know okay so how so
if we take away these numbers so what

166
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:51,360
if we take away these numbers so what
 

167
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,550
if we take away these numbers so what
should we do next

168
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:52,560
should we do next
 

169
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,390
should we do next
oh we shall say remaining is two

170
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:56,400
oh we shall say remaining is two
 

171
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,670
oh we shall say remaining is two
and three and ten and then okay

172
00:03:59,670 --> 00:03:59,680
and three and ten and then okay
 

173
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,390
and three and ten and then okay
so then we add two and three and ten

174
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:04,400
so then we add two and three and ten
 

175
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,149
so then we add two and three and ten
and then divide it by a card and then we

176
00:04:06,149 --> 00:04:06,159
and then divide it by a card and then we
 

177
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,229
and then divide it by a card and then we
choose three okay

178
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:08,239
choose three okay
 

179
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,110
choose three okay
i know yeah and we divided by n minus

180
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:11,120
i know yeah and we divided by n minus
 

181
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,750
i know yeah and we divided by n minus
one

182
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:11,760
one
 

183
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,190
one
we're done and minus one here m okay so

184
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:15,200
we're done and minus one here m okay so
 

185
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,870
we're done and minus one here m okay so
look if we take away this number

186
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:18,880
look if we take away this number
 

187
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,189
look if we take away this number
do we need to calculate the sum of these

188
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:21,199
do we need to calculate the sum of these
 

189
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,390
do we need to calculate the sum of these
they're the worse

190
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:22,400
they're the worse
 

191
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,870
they're the worse
but that's okay we worry about it later

192
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:24,880
but that's okay we worry about it later
 

193
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,670
but that's okay we worry about it later
alright

194
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:25,680
alright
 

195
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,510
alright
so in the cartons do you understand what

196
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:29,520
so in the cartons do you understand what
 

197
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,030
so in the cartons do you understand what
i'm talking about

198
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:31,040
i'm talking about
 

199
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,070
i'm talking about
if i take away these two how can i know

200
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,080
if i take away these two how can i know
 

201
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,629
if i take away these two how can i know
immediately what's the sum of the one

202
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:36,639
immediately what's the sum of the one
 

203
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,469
immediately what's the sum of the one
plus three plus ten

204
00:04:40,469 --> 00:04:40,479

 

205
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,550

well i need to calculate that 1 plus 3

206
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:42,560
well i need to calculate that 1 plus 3
 

207
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,870
well i need to calculate that 1 plus 3
plus 10 if i take away 3

208
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:44,880
plus 10 if i take away 3
 

209
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,990
plus 10 if i take away 3
how do i know exactly what what the sum

210
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,000
how do i know exactly what what the sum
 

211
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,070
how do i know exactly what what the sum
of 1 plus 2 plus 10

212
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,080

 

213
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,430

think about it what's the sum of one

214
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:55,440
think about it what's the sum of one
 

215
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,990
think about it what's the sum of one
plus two plus three plus ten

216
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,000
plus two plus three plus ten
 

217
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,029
plus two plus three plus ten
oh uh uh sixteen okay

218
00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:01,039
oh uh uh sixteen okay
 

219
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,790
oh uh uh sixteen okay
then if i take away two what's the sum

220
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:02,800
then if i take away two what's the sum
 

221
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,150
then if i take away two what's the sum
of one plus three

222
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:04,160
of one plus three
 

223
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,909
of one plus three
yeah if i take away three what's the sum

224
00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:05,919
yeah if i take away three what's the sum
 

225
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,189
yeah if i take away three what's the sum
of one plus

226
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:07,199
of one plus
 

227
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,150
of one plus
yeah you got it the sum the minus the

228
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:10,160
yeah you got it the sum the minus the
 

229
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,950
yeah you got it the sum the minus the
number you take

230
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:10,960
number you take
 

231
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,310
number you take
right yeah okay so

232
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:14,320
right yeah okay so
 

233
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,830
right yeah okay so
so okay so you got it yeah okay

234
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:17,840
so okay so you got it yeah okay
 

235
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,670
so okay so you got it yeah okay
define define check okay define

236
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:21,680
define define check okay define
 

237
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:28,790
define define check okay define
numbers and target

238
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:28,800

 

239
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,790

okay sum equals s-u-m

240
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:32,800
okay sum equals s-u-m
 

241
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,950
okay sum equals s-u-m
number so this is the sum of all numbers

242
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:36,960
number so this is the sum of all numbers
 

243
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,790
number so this is the sum of all numbers
this takes o and time right because we

244
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:38,800
this takes o and time right because we
 

245
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,310
this takes o and time right because we
need to go through each number

246
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:40,320
need to go through each number
 

247
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,469
need to go through each number
and add it together this place over and

248
00:05:42,469 --> 00:05:42,479
and add it together this place over and
 

249
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:43,749
and add it together this place over and
over right oh yes

250
00:05:43,749 --> 00:05:43,759
over right oh yes
 

251
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,270
over right oh yes
and then now for ei

252
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:47,280
and then now for ei
 

253
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,070
and then now for ei
in nums we try each numbers right

254
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:52,080
in nums we try each numbers right
 

255
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,629
in nums we try each numbers right
okay then if i take away the number look

256
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:54,639
okay then if i take away the number look
 

257
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,110
okay then if i take away the number look
if

258
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:57,120

 

259
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,309

some take away the number i

260
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:00,319
some take away the number i
 

261
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,350
some take away the number i
and what is it equal if

262
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:03,360
and what is it equal if
 

263
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,469
and what is it equal if
s minus one i uh okay so

264
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:06,479
s minus one i uh okay so
 

265
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,590
s minus one i uh okay so
it's the sum if

266
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:09,600
it's the sum if
 

267
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,510
it's the sum if
some i might take away the number that's

268
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:11,520
some i might take away the number that's
 

269
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,749
some i might take away the number that's
a sum of the

270
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:13,759
a sum of the
 

271
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,830
a sum of the
remaining numbers yeah we take away and

272
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:17,840
remaining numbers yeah we take away and
 

273
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,990
remaining numbers yeah we take away and
what does z equal we

274
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:20,000
what does z equal we
 

275
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,029
what does z equal we
who is t oh we need to divide it by n

276
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:23,039
who is t oh we need to divide it by n
 

277
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:23,830
who is t oh we need to divide it by n
minus one

278
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:23,840
minus one
 

279
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,590
minus one
divided by n minus one so length right

280
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:27,600
divided by n minus one so length right
 

281
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,270
divided by n minus one so length right
num minus one right

282
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:31,280
num minus one right
 

283
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,710
num minus one right
and equals one what then what is the

284
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:34,720
and equals one what then what is the
 

285
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,830
and equals one what then what is the
equal

286
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:35,840
equal
 

287
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:41,110
equal
it equals the uh if it equals the target

288
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:41,120
it equals the uh if it equals the target
 

289
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,469
it equals the uh if it equals the target
okay this e equals t right so you can

290
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:44,479
okay this e equals t right so you can
 

291
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,070
okay this e equals t right so you can
transit you can move this to

292
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:46,080
transit you can move this to
 

293
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,110
transit you can move this to
the other side means to multiply right

294
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:49,120
the other side means to multiply right
 

295
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,309
the other side means to multiply right
yeah so it would

296
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:52,319
yeah so it would
 

297
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,830
yeah so it would
if t s minus i equals p times

298
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:55,840
if t s minus i equals p times
 

299
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,870
if t s minus i equals p times
length numbers

300
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:58,880
length numbers
 

301
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:06,629
length numbers
minus one right okay

302
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:06,639

 

303
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,589

and what's missing

304
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:11,599

 

305
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,070

now if the if everything is the

306
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:14,080
now if the if everything is the
 

307
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,029
now if the if everything is the
attention and what's

308
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:15,039
attention and what's
 

309
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,070
attention and what's
what should i return yeah

310
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:18,080
what should i return yeah
 

311
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,950
what should i return yeah
yeah oh yeah oh yeah what's the time

312
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:20,960
yeah oh yeah oh yeah what's the time
 

313
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,950

00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:26,160
i right yeah all right i equals
 

339
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,430
i right yeah all right i equals
s if i equals s times

340
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:29,440
s if i equals s times
 

341
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,870
s if i equals s times
this t right all right yeah so if i

342
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:32,880
this t right all right yeah so if i
 

343
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,990
this t right all right yeah so if i
equals s

344
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:34,000
equals s
 

345
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,550
equals s
minus minus t times this right that

346
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:36,560
minus minus t times this right that
 

347
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,550
minus minus t times this right that
minus is the same right

348
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:40,560
minus is the same right
 

349
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,269
minus is the same right
yeah because eventually we want to find

350
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:43,279
yeah because eventually we want to find
 

351
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:43,990
yeah because eventually we want to find
out if i

352
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:44,000
out if i
 

353
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,550
out if i
is in one of these right if this number

354
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:46,560
is in one of these right if this number
 

355
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,389
is in one of these right if this number
is in one i right

356
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:48,399
is in one i right
 

357
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,750
is in one i right
all right does it make sense

358
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:51,760
all right does it make sense
 

359
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,710
all right does it make sense
so we want to find out look for i

360
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:54,720
so we want to find out look for i
 

361
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,430
so we want to find out look for i
numbers

362
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:55,440
numbers
 

363
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,550
numbers
if i equals something right yes

364
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:58,560
if i equals something right yes
 

365
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,670
if i equals something right yes
all right look it's least changing

366
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:01,680
all right look it's least changing
 

367
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,590
all right look it's least changing
s is not changing right we already know

368
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:03,600
s is not changing right we already know
 

369
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,509
s is not changing right we already know
it t is not changing right

370
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:05,519
it t is not changing right
 

371
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,310
it t is not changing right
this is no one right so these if i is

372
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:08,320
this is no one right so these if i is
 

373
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:08,870
this is no one right so these if i is
something

374
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:08,880
something
 

375
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,509
something
is something right it's already known

376
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:11,519
is something right it's already known
 

377
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,150
is something right it's already known
right

378
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:12,160
right
 

379
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,070
right
so what does it mean we can do this one

380
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:14,080
so what does it mean we can do this one
 

381
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,910
so what does it mean we can do this one
one nine thing return

382
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:17,920

 

383
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,590

sum we have three returns no i'm

384
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:21,600
sum we have three returns no i'm
 

385
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,829
sum we have three returns no i'm
i'm talking about these one none okay

386
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:23,839
i'm talking about these one none okay
 

387
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,430
i'm talking about these one none okay
you don't need this okay

388
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:25,440
you don't need this okay
 

389
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,630
you don't need this okay
some lamb these are s

390
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:28,640
some lamb these are s
 

391
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,910
some lamb these are s
right minus t

392
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:31,920
right minus t
 

393
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,870
right minus t
times l n numbs well that's gonna be so

394
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:36,880
times l n numbs well that's gonna be so
 

395
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,990
times l n numbs well that's gonna be so
long minus r1

396
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:40,000
long minus r1
 

397
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,630
long minus r1
yeah this is the number right this is

398
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:42,640
yeah this is the number right this is
 

399
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,310
yeah this is the number right this is
the number we want to find out if it's

400
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:44,320
the number we want to find out if it's
 

401
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,350
the number we want to find out if it's
in the dumps right

402
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:45,360
in the dumps right
 

403
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,670
in the dumps right
i can't see yeah so what should we do

404
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:49,680

 

405
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,430

in num

406
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:53,440

 

407
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,430

that's it so all these nines can be

408
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:55,440
that's it so all these nines can be
 

409
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,630
that's it so all these nines can be
replaced by this one

410
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:56,640
replaced by this one
 

411
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,269
replaced by this one
right doesn't make sense yeah it's

412
00:09:59,269 --> 00:09:59,279
right doesn't make sense yeah it's
 

413
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,550
right doesn't make sense yeah it's
looking good look what's the

414
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:00,560
looking good look what's the
 

415
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,190
looking good look what's the
if num if noun equals one two three

if num if noun equals one two three
 

417
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,990
if num if noun equals one two three
four right okay so can you tell me five

418
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:08,000

in
 

421
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,190
in
numbers is it return true or false

422
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:13,200

 

423
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,110

it's what you're talking you mean yeah

424
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:15,120
it's what you're talking you mean yeah
 

425
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,870
it's what you're talking you mean yeah
five nums

426
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:16,880
five nums

so does it make sense it's the same

432
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:29,440
so does it make sense it's the same
 

433

you can just do this if
 

473
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,550
you can just do this if
this is enough right
