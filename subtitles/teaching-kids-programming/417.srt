1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,560
hello guys hello hello okay so today

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:07,200
we'll be cooking okay i'm going to show

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:10,080
you a graph which is made by this

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,759
twitter and the spiral yes spider so

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:16,800
so can you imagine if i do this

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,080
repeat 100 times then every time

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,160
i would go

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,840
for what

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,640
i times two

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,800
and every time i would turn right

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,320
91 degrees so can you imagine what

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,960
happened

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,960
can you imagine

14
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,520
so every time i look at the i would be

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,879
incremented from

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,120
uh it will be iterated from 0 to 99 yeah

17
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,239
and every time i will the first time i

18
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,480
will go

19
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,280
zlo the second time i would go

20
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,079
two

21
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,680
that's one the third time i would go

22
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,160
well

23
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,800
four right so two four

24
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,079
six eight ten yeah every time you'll be

25
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,079
like two

26
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:01,359
two two to two more and then every time

27
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,840
i would turn 91 degrees 90 degrees the

28
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,960
right angle right 91 degrees a little

29
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,960
bit more so i can use this angle to turn

30
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,680
wrong and run and run i'm right

31
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,520
so

32
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,360
eventually you'll be showing the spiral

33
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,439
okay let's do this

34
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,920
okay you see

35
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:19,920
yeah method is a

36
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,240
drawing yeah

37
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,240
okay

38
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,280
that's cool it looks cool yeah let's see

39
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,439
so it's good keep drawing drawing

40
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,759
and then you can see this spiral spiral

41
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,759
okay

42
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,079
yeah this is actually a very famous uh

43
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,159
shape when you land the turtle

44
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,600
programming yeah so it's it's quite

45
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,560
amazing that

46
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:47,119
we can just use this simple loop yeah so

47
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,840
look at this it's quite simple yeah so

48
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:52,640
repeat a hundred times and every time i

49
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,520
i ask the turtle to work a little bit

50
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,119
more

51
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:01,040
every time and then after that to turn

52
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:04,719
91 degrees right yeah yeah if let's see

53
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:07,759
if we do this uh 90 degree what happened

54
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:09,599
let's see if we just do this 90 degree

55
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,160
whoa

56
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,160
you wouldn't even turn here let's see

57
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,080
90 degree 90 degrees is the right angle

58
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,360
so you'll be like that

59
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,360
all right okay let's see

60
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,840
so it'll be quite straight here

61
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,840
yeah make sure

62
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,120
yeah

63
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,720
it's like uh

64
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,599
a maze

65
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,120
yeah

66
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,840
it's like amazing

67
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,720
well not

68
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:41,519
really not really not really amazed not

69
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,959
really amazing okay so but yeah

70
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,599
but you see the difference yeah 90

71
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:49,120
degree and then 91 how about 89 89 would

72
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:51,280
be similar to night night

73
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,920
yeah yes yeah exactly let's give you a

74
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:57,680
hundred no let's try the

75
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,360
981 degree okay that's a very good

76
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,920
experiment

77
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,920
a times two

78
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,239
you'll be uh

79
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,319
you'll be

80
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,159
spinning the other way right previously

81
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,800
it was a little bit tilted to the right

82
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,640
now it's a little bit to the left

83
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,800
yeah

84
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,879
okay it looks messy now

85
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,120
yeah but if you turn that away you'll

86
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,080
see quite similar to

87
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,879
to

88
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,720
to the first cases when you show the 891

89
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,879
degrees am i right how about you do

90
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,120
something like a hundred a hundred

91
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,400
what's a hundred okay so let's see 100

92
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,720
okay

93
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,560
so actually we can make this uh if you

94
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,200
want we can we can do this we can put

95
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,159
this in the function and define spiral

96
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:45,840
and then you that will be degree you you

97
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:48,480
you're asking for that so for i in range

98
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,040
let's say make it 100 fix

99
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,040
fd

100
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:58,400
fpi times 2 and then 10 wide degree yeah

101
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,760
this is the parameter with passing now

102
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:05,680
we first of all reset and

103
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,680
spiral 100 yeah

104
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,840
good

105
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,760
oh you see because it tends overturn a

106
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,280
little bit yeah so it doesn't look like

107
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,160
a spiral anymore it looks like a flower

108
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,199
maybe

109
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,120
yeah

110
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,799
yeah got it

111
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,240
it looks messy

112
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,240
looks messy

113
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,800
looks still quite cool

114
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,720
quite cool okay looks like flower you

115
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,840
get it yeah we define a function we pass

116
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,680
the degree

117
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,080
we pass the degree as a parameter we

118
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,479
know we call it spiral is the 100 which

119
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,639
is passed as a degree and 10 by the

120
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:41,120
degree okay makes sense no it's not even

121
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,800
the square yeah yeah okay okay yeah

122
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,080
that'll be for today easy yeah easy

123
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:49,639
peasy bye bye bye bye bye

124
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,639
bye bye
