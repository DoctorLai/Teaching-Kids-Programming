1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
hello hello

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:05,839
allow me stay with mr right now all

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,320
right okay so let's visit the binary

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:10,639
trees okay butter cheese binary trees

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,519
okay we talk about vinyl trees a lot of

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:13,519
times spinach

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,160
so in one sentence what spinal choice

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,920
is a tree with numbers

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,039
and the last two kids

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,519
okay

11
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:31,920
the left and the left of

12
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:33,840
the tree the root must be smaller than

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,160
it and then let's find the research

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,680
trick okay you're talking a little bit

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,399
more about it

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,040
okay so i pick the keywords okay so

17
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,879
two right binary two right

18
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,280
yeah and the numbers it's actually the

19
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,600
notes does not necessarily be numbers it

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,640
could be strings you know any type of

21
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,360
data so binary is like a data structure

22
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:59,199
okay it's a tree and what are trees

23
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,320
trees are directed a cyclic graph okay

24
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,719
yeah

25
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,280
directly means that it it's actually

26
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,280
don't have a doesn't have a

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,080
direction but we we call it directly

28
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:14,240
ascetical because usually we were given

29
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:16,880
these trees pine trees you know whatever

30
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,880
now we can only visit the kids from my

31
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,840
parents so it's always one direction

32
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,280
yeah we cannot go in a reverse order

33
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,360
yeah

34
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,560
unless you store the you know the

35
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,960
parents that's totally the other story

36
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,720
exactly it doesn't have a cycle if it

37
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,479
has cycle we call it graph okay it

38
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,799
doesn't have cycles

39
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:39,759
graph okay the trees are graph and the

40
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,320
binary tree particularly let a kid a

41
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,399
parent can only have two kids a mouth

42
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,040
you can have one kid you can have two

43
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,040
kids but you cannot have more than that

44
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,560
if it doesn't have any kids we call it

45
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,640
leaves okay if the parent if if a kid if

46
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,360
a note doesn't have a parent like what

47
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,360
what do we call it

48
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:01,049
[Music]

49
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:09,840
foreign okay so for this binary tree if

50
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,840
we remove one edge what will happen

51
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,840
uh it will

52
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,760
separate and be a forest

53
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,360
well done it will separate into two two

54
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,360
trees two sub

55
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,319
two trees okay one tree will be the

56
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,760
subset subtree of the another one of the

57
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,400
entire tree okay

58
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,080
so we call it uh let's multiply the sum

59
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,520
of these two right for example if i

60
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,280
remove this edge

61
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,319
so that will become a four okay so

62
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,640
what's the sum of these remaining trees

63
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,440
uh it's uh

64
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,959
eleven eleven then that's times the sum

65
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,720
which is forty-four

66
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,959
okay and then how about if i remove this

67
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,959
edge

68
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:52,400
that'll be ten times five is fifty okay

69
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,879
so this this is the maximum okay if we

70
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:58,080
keep removing because look they have how

71
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,599
many choice can we do can we separate

72
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,920
how many edges

73
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,000
if we cut that yeah yeah one four three

74
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,519
four so if you cut one edges they'll

75
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,080
become two okay

76
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,760
so we want to find out to maximize the

77
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,560
splitted sum

78
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,640
yeah

79
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,120
okay we want to maximize the split

80
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,120
system

81
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,400
how are we doing we how can we do it i

82
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,519
mean we

83
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,680
can do that so look this time

84
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,519
maxim sound okay so if we remove it

85
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,400
right so first of all

86
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,400
if we remove it

87
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,360
if we remove it we'll get two trees

88
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,519
right let's focus about the subtree

89
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,920
right because look if i remove this edge

90
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,400
this is a sub tree right if we know the

91
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,319
sub tree and

92
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,879
if known as substrate let's say if the

93
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,680
total sum is t okay

94
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,239
right

95
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,680
all right the total sum is t we can do

96
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,680
this with definitions your preference

97
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,000
search one go you won't go right yeah

98
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,720
remember if it is t and then if i tell

99
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,400
you b the sum of these is

100
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,519
our sub 3 is left side t prime

101
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,799
okay

102
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,720
okay what's the subtree of the remaining

103
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,840
i just actually

104
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,840
written

105
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,159
written there sorry

106
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,880
if the whole infinite sum of all

107
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,239
everything is t and if the subtree if

108
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,160
these subject

109
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,560
t prime and then what's the remaining

110
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,680
sum come on it's very obvious

111
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,880
one

112
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,840
that

113
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,520
no

114
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,600
sorry the whole minus t prime t minus d

115
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,280
prime yeah i would just written there

116
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,400
and then wrap it down

117
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,639
and then yeah you see so

118
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,720
yeah yeah so look at that maximum sum we

119
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,639
want the maximum these we have t

120
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,639
minus t prime

121
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,479
times t prime

122
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,199
right t

123
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:51,680
t minus t prime is least this will be

124
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,040
yeah if we remove this bit t prime is

125
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,800
this bit

126
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:59,199
okay so it's actually

127
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:01,600
t minus t prime is listed times t okay

128
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:04,240
so we want to maximize maximize we want

129
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:08,320
to maximize this maximize

130
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,120
maximize t minus t prime times t okay

131
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,400
uh

132
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,000
times equal okay sorry times t one okay

133
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,800
yeah

134
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,320
so in order to get this t

135
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,320
sum we can do this different social

136
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,400
processors it's easy yeah let's let's

137
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:26,160
quickly write it it's easy we've written

138
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,160
this before us defy

139
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,560
loot

140
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,560
if not

141
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,520
that pen is bad

142
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,720
nothing

143
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,720
then the sum will be what

144
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:48,479
[Music]

145
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,160
it's not good

146
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:53,440
okay it's wet

147
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:56,800
returns yellow okay

148
00:05:53,440 --> 00:06:00,319
land return return

149
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,720
lose the value plus the left bit what's

150
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:05,680
that speed come on it's easy recursion

151
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,639
it's easy um depends

152
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:11,440
root of value plus the left bit sum what

153
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,600
and then plus somewhat the question come

154
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,160
on

155
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,720
i also calculated the sum of the entire

156
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,039
tree and then if the node is empty i can

157
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,039
return

158
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,039
and

159
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,880
and lose the value plus the left b plus

160
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,800
the right come on this is the easy part

161
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,039
you can figure it out

162
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,039
huh

163
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,960
yeah easy this is easier look at that

164
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,120
with the question and the question

165
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,840
look at the the sum of the entire tree

166
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,120
equals what look the sum of entire tree

167
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,280
equals one

168
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,639
plus the left the three the sum of the

169
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,720
that tree and the sum of right three

170
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,199
which is we already know we already know

171
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:58,080
yeah this is the recursion yeah yeah

172
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,840
okay make sense this is easy so if we go

173
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,520
in if we perform this step as search

174
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,960
because then recursive definition once

175
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,000
that takes over in time if they are

176
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,520
unknown right then we get this t right

177
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,599
right yeah

178
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,759
so then we could do another test search

179
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,840
and then at the meantime yeah we at the

180
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,800
meantime we

181
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:21,440
can because this is the such sum of

182
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:24,000
every sub tree right basically is the

183
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,319
sum of every subject this is the same as

184
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,360
we remove one edge right so we try every

185
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:32,720
possibility of removing each edges

186
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:35,199
so once we become remove one edges

187
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,199
once we become removing the edges that

188
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,199
would be a sum

189
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,440
yeah that would be a partial sum of

190
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,479
another subtree right

191
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,000
so we can do this

192
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,599
no

193
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,080
so we can we can do another type of

194
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,080
study okay

195
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,599
and

196
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,599
i possibly need

197
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,039
okay

198
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,080
wait give me one second

199
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,840
so guys let's have a little chat okay

200
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,879
sit down please

201
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,879
please okay so

202
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,280
so we can do another different search

203
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,039
okay tf

204
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,039
search route

205
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:25,520
so at the meantime we have this answer

206
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:28,720
at the beginning let's say

207
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:31,280
max infinity the negative

208
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,279
the the most small is the number we can

209
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,080
think of is the uh

210
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,760
minus negative okay minus negative okay

211
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,599
so this part is quite the same yeah if

212
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,159
not root

213
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,800
return return of zero actually we we

214
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:49,040
just copy over right i know we can have

215
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,040
uh these so the left bit

216
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,640
so so what the

217
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,480
the current will be equals rule the

218
00:08:54,640 --> 00:09:01,279
value

219
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,279
plus therefore search rule the left

220
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,480
plus therefore search blue dot right

221
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:11,519
okay so once we have these values okay

222
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,440
so this is the subset summary so we can

223
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,760
say okay answer

224
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,519
equals max

225
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,600
answer yeah we want to get the maximum

226
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,160
right but now we know the total sum

227
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,760
right so before we call this function we

228
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,160
have a total

229
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,200
so the let's say this is called t equals

230
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,480
sum

231
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:33,360
blue right so we we use this function

232
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,839
to get the sum first and then t times

233
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,160
t minus

234
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:39,600
current times carbon right yeah that's

235
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,240
what we said yeah

236
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:45,519
right now we are at this point we know

237
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,440
that's the sum of this subtree right

238
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,720
yeah

239
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,959
and then t t is the total sum minus

240
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,279
the current subtree is the remaining

241
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:58,000
tree that's the the sum of linear tree

242
00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:00,160
and times itself okay and then we turn

243
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,120
this is the same return

244
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,399
current

245
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,200
okay

246
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,120
yeah so we do this once we do this twice

247
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,800
uh to another so look these two

248
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,000
functions is quite similar right except

249
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,040
that

250
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,440
this function by itself

251
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,920
by itself is returns the

252
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,560
these two functions is actually the same

253
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:23,519
returning the sum of the current

254
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:26,320
sub carbon tree the only difference is

255
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,880
that we have added this plug in here

256
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,279
plug in this value to obtain the max

257
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,120
split tree a split sum

258
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,880
but it needs these t first right we

259
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,480
don't have this value first right so

260
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,880
that's why i need to call this function

261
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,519
first so get this t right because the

262
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,720
sum of a total tree doesn't change right

263
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,560
am i

264
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,839
yeah we can manage financing you know

265
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:50,399
the sum but yeah already right it's

266
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,000
never changing right it's not changing

267
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,240
but we can't call this function directly

268
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,360
because t we haven't known right we need

269
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,360
to get it

270
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,959
yeah right

271
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,959
this is o n this is o

272
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:05,779
[Music]

273
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,320
sorry

274
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:14,320
if i perform this oh n and this is our n

275
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,320
what's added together

276
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:27,519
okay so another way another way would be

277
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:30,399
will be similar to this instead of doing

278
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:33,600
this we can store all the values all the

279
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:36,000
subsystem in the in a set right in a set

280
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,279
which is unique yeah in a set and then

281
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,800
we can go through the set of later right

282
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,959
so i'm just clicking

283
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,959
yeah

284
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:46,279
[Music]

285
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,120
so we can go so look we have this sum

286
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,000
okay let's say

287
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,760
uh sum okay some equal a set right

288
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,360
what's that

289
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,959
what's set

290
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:03,279
set is

291
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:05,680
like if you it's better than the um

292
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:09,440
because if if you look up so for

293
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,720
something you would say set is 01 but in

294
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,480
list is

295
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,399
oh and yeah

296
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,920
okay it's not there is no one better

297
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:19,120
than the other it's just for different

298
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:22,000
purposes the set stores the unique

299
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,440
numbers only yeah it's a unique it only

300
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,200
stores the unique

301
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,200
elements all right

302
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,240
so let's say we have empty set and then

303
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:33,360
we have this therefore search first yeah

304
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,839
so this is the simple yeah if not loot

305
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,839
if you're not root return yellow yeah

306
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,160
yeah

307
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:44,160
and then left beat equals definite

308
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:46,399
search but the sum of the left tree

309
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,320
the sum of variety

310
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,240
because therefore search

311
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,079
through the right

312
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,160
yeah because requested recording this

313
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,160
function to attempt the sum from the

314
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,519
left bit left tree and left right by

315
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:01,360
three okay now we can do this sum

316
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,920
dot at

317
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:07,800
we add the left tree right look i need

318
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,800
to yeah and it looks

319
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:14,560
so one two three four five six seven so

320
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,560
look if calling this loot here and i

321
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,360
will call the left which is the three of

322
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,279
these the sum would be two four five

323
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,600
two plus four plus one eleven and i

324
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,880
added that eleven to the set okay

325
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,279
i thought right three what's the sum of

326
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:30,320
the right three is three plus six plus

327
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:32,880
seven is sixteen and i put a 16 in the

328
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,880
set right

329
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:41,120
right right

330
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:45,360
and also the current would be what

331
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,480
so i also need to add one thumb dot add

332
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,639
left

333
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,920
plus right

334
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:54,639
plus neutral value right

335
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:57,279
and i need to return this value return

336
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:59,600
this lieutenant speaker so let's total

337
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:02,800
okay let's put it let's say uh we can

338
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,079
save this in a value total left plus

339
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,120
right

340
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,120
plus neutral value

341
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,000
okay

342
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,360
look yeah

343
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,279
so

344
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,440
once i've done this what should i do

345
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,839
next next once i've done this i watch i

346
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,839
do next

347
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,320
we

348
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,360
run it so look if i do this i some add

349
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,160
the set

350
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,880
as the possible left tree sum the right

351
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:31,600
tree sum and then all over all right so

352
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,720
i need to go through the set right

353
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,279
right

354
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,600
and i know this uh i know these that's

355
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:41,600
the total right so i can do this

356
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:43,680
uh total equals that's a search root

357
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:47,680
for i yeah and then that goes through

358
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:49,440
that i in this set yes some sum set okay

359
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:53,040
and then answer

360
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:55,680
also be the minimum again

361
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:58,160
infinity yeah infinity

362
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,920
answer equals max

363
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:04,000
answer

364
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:06,800
t minus i right times i right

365
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,199
yeah this is the same so we actually we

366
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,680
do this we first of all perform this

367
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:15,040
step search and then we're collecting

368
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:17,199
all the sums in the set

369
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,279
yeah so the set contains all the

370
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:21,120
possible subsets sum because we're

371
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:23,279
adding the left sum

372
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,440
the right sum and then the current

373
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:28,240
overall sum right and then we go through

374
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:31,839
the set again

375
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,680
t yeah we already know this t also okay

376
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,880
so this function return that does two

377
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,720
purposes

378
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,199
first of all is to collect the values

379
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,959
the possible sums in this in set the

380
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,120
second value

381
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,720
the the purpose second purpose is to

382
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,639
return the sum

383
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:50,000
of the overall tree of the currency

384
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:53,120
right what it just did you just say

385
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,839
it to some of the overall things of the

386
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,839
tree and then what's the second purpose

387
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,959
the second purpose

388
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,759
is to

389
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,480
uh

390
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,320
add the overall

391
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,639
what are these sorry

392
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,639
i don't know

393
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,040
the um

394
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:09,920
[Music]

395
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,680
huh

396
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,759
what's the two purpose of this function

397
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,440
come on if you read this function

398
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,720
okay the search

399
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,399
uh is not ready to return zero yeah i

400
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,079
know i can read the code whatever what i

401
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:25,120
mean is what's the purpose of this

402
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:26,880
function what does it do come on

403
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,800
what's this what what what does they do

404
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,600
they are two things here yeah first

405
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,920
thing

406
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,440
and here's two things okay so what what

407
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,519
is these two

408
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,440
i'm saying like what's the purpose of

409
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,240
this function come on

410
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,680
um

411
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,800
some add

412
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,079
left yeah i know what's what

413
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,199
and some of the

414
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:48,160
ad right is adding the right part yeah

415
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,639
into

416
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,639
the set

417
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:09,760
is and it returns the answer

418
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,559
the value of the the sum of the country

419
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,319
yeah

420
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,880
okay that's two purposes yes i know you

421
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,400
understand yeah okay

422
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,760
but you need to work out on your

423
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:22,799
presentation skill to make it clear to

424
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,959
to demonstrate that okay extremely well

425
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,959
okay and then by going through this

426
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,960
number the subset there's some possible

427
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,000
sums in this in a

428
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,840
in a set

429
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,080
now we can try we can calculate the

430
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,360
maximum of the space sum right

431
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,600
yeah look

432
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,320
t minus i times i what's this mean come

433
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,520
on

434
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:43,039
e minus minus i times i yeah what's tm

435
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,640
can you explain to me what's this t

436
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,480
minus i times i

437
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,760
it's a t

438
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:52,080
which minus i and times i yeah what does

439
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,080
it mean

440
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,960
so what's t

441
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,960
t

442
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,360
did she

443
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:04,640
what's the t here t equals definition

444
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:06,000
what's t t is the difference it is the

445
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,160
difference actually

446
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,120
the tree what is in detail what does it

447
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,360
mean

448
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:15,200
what does it you just say here then t

449
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:16,880
equals definition so what's this meaning

450
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,480
the whole tree what what of the whole

451
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,919
tree

452
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,760
what are we doing here what are the

453
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:26,320
whole tree so what's the value if i call

454
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:27,280
t equals dfs good loot is here points to

455
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,360
here what

456
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:32,080
what what's the value of it

457
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:34,160
what's the value what's this t

458
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,320
t is the

459
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,480
value

460
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:42,480
is the what values come on what's the

461
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:45,360
what do we tell is the value huh it's a

462
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,919
load here root is one so what i call t

463
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,200
equals f research root and what does t

464
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,919
equal

465
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,120
t equals one

466
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,400
two

467
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:58,000
one one over two

468
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,559
what are we doing here one two three

469
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,880
four five six seven yeah whatever what i

470
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:05,360
would do with the number three

471
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,799
one two

472
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,360
wait one

473
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:11,919
what's this function return left plus y

474
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:14,080
plus root of value rule of value is one

475
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,720
left is

476
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,640
root left one two four three five six

477
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,360
seven

478
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,919
yes i okay you're still not getting it t

479
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:26,000
equals stiffer such load if we know that

480
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:28,320
if this is the tree i know that it's

481
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,400
pointing to here this is the loop

482
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,400
and what does it return if you say okay

483
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:35,840
it's written that plus y plus root of

484
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,720
value so the left is dfs root on left

485
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,000
here

486
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:42,640
right html to the right value is one so

487
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,039
it equals one plus the left b plus the

488
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,960
right bit so that okay so the left bit

489
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:49,440
equals two plus the that bit plus the

490
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,000
rabbit so it's recursion so so once this

491
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,360
function returns what

492
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,160
does it return

493
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,980
11 right now

494
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,120
the left face

495
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:01,679
[Music]

496
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,520
the right street yeah i know the left 3

497
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,720
plus the right trick what plus how do

498
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,880
you press the left tree and the

499
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,679
parachute the numbers what do you what

500
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:12,799
do we do with the numbers

501
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:15,440
that's the one i want um i want add them

502
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:17,919
together that's the sum okay t is the

503
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:21,039
sum so it's one plus two plus three plus

504
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:24,320
four plus five plus six yeah so that's

505
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:26,640
how much 38 right is it 28

506
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:30,400
wait two plus four six single five is

507
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:32,400
eleven eleven plus uh yeah okay

508
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,480
twenty eight okay so t twenty eight the

509
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,600
possible sum okay the left left bit is

510
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:40,960
one two plus one so i what's in the sum

511
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:44,720
sum is four five six seven yeah i know

512
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:46,559
what two plus four has five

513
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,720
yeah what's that

514
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,720
two plus

515
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:59,679
and then all together is what

516
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,840
is what 28 right okay

517
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,799
so i need to go through this number and

518
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,320
then i try to do this t minus i times i

519
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:08,080
okay coming back to this question what's

520
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,679
t minus i times i

521
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,120
it's the sum

522
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,679
minus

523
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:17,360
this is the total sum and the minus

524
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:18,480
i is here i see here i is here in one of

525
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,280
the

526
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,679
t minus i times i what does it mean

527
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,280
it means the total sum

528
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,280
subtract

529
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:31,760
the

530
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:32,640
i there yeah what does i represent the

531
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,000
the

532
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:38,159
left and right tree it's the sum of the

533
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,440
left right

534
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:43,280
is the sum of any sub tree right yeah

535
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,840
so remember coming back to this question

536
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,600
we want to split remove one edges and

537
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,480
split into two if we remove this one

538
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,799
edge

539
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,760
then this sum would be two plus one plus

540
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:56,080
five which is eleven and twenty-eight i

541
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,280
know 28 right so what's the sum of this

542
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,840
bit

543
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,840
it must be

544
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:05,440
something where down yeah the total is

545
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:08,720
28 never change this is 11 right so the

546
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,159
other part is 28 minus 11 and then last

547
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,600
product is what

548
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:15,200
t minus i times i that's it

549
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,039
makes sense

550
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,480
yeah we're done okay that's it for today

551
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:21,480
good job

552
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,480
bye
