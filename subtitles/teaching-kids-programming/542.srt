1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,160
why

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,720
okay so a few days ago we talked about

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,599
this maze program right we're going to

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:13,500
find the nearest exit

5
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:15,660
yeah in the Maze okay so the exit and

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,060
entrance are the empty cells On the

7
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,619
Border these borders and their four

8
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,820
borders right

9
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:23,220
and

10
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,019
engine is not the exit so for example if

11
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,480
you're given this entry and you can't

12
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:29,699
just go back to this right obviously

13
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,640
it's just not exit you have to find a

14
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:34,500
ways to other axes in the Border okay

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,940
I'd only talk about a breakfast search

16
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:40,500
right because these actually this is the

17
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:42,360
unweighted graph I'm waiting I'm

18
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,340
directly graph right we're finding with

19
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:48,000
the shortest part I think the one

20
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:50,460
Newton Corner yeah so yeah so for

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,520
example like we call this cross this is

22
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:56,340
represent uh see what you're doing a

23
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,079
wall a wall no okay so the shot is

24
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,980
passed if we give them this entry shot

25
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:04,260
is passed to the exit would be nice

26
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:07,439
it'll be this one right yeah but but

27
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,420
before when the moon won that it was

28
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,939
that one which is different made if

29
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,700
there are exits you return the shortest

30
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:17,159
part the distance so one two three four

31
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:20,100
five six you return six right and if

32
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:24,180
they are not exists or if there is no

33
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:26,340
ways I have no way is to the x is 0 to

34
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,619
10 minus one makes sense well you can

35
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:32,939
break the word no we don't this is the

36
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:36,479
entry one two three four five six seven

37
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:39,960
eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen

38
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:43,320
okay so we don't Mark the walls because

39
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,900
there's no point to push the positions

40
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,180
of the walls into the queue because we

41
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:51,840
you know we don't go there basically

42
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,640
right we go to this empty cell so the

43
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,020
perfect search first thing first all

44
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,079
right so at the beginning will push to

45
00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:00,720
the entrance one okay we DQ DQ means to

46
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:03,920
take the element from the Q in the left

47
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,920
top left yeah

48
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:12,660
which means that we push the kit off of

49
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,160
the you know the children to on the

50
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,440
right hand side okay so we take you out

51
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:21,300
what's the keep of wine what's the next

52
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:24,300
two right only two okay so put it two so

53
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:26,160
two we take it off what's the kit of two

54
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,680
one and three but one we have visited

55
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:32,459
before right we need to have at least a

56
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:34,920
scene table hashtag to remember the

57
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:37,020
petition we have visited so we take a

58
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:40,260
two out we take a two hour the kid is

59
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:41,580
three okay three we take it out what's

60
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,920
the kit for

61
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,480
oh we take it out what's the kid three

62
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,040
and five or three we have seen it before

63
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,379
so five

64
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,220
five we take it out what's the Kid of

65
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:53,040
Five

66
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:55,860
four nine eight right but we have seen

67
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,720
four before so nine and eight

68
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:01,319
okay what's the kit of nine take it out

69
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:04,200
and six ten and five right but we have

70
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:07,200
seen five before so

71
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:10,040
what's six and five one and five

72
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:14,340
children is six okay okay

73
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:17,519
ah five five so what is it five six here

74
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:19,800
right is it so now we six take it off

75
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,959
what's the kit five we've seen it before

76
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,420
seven right seven

77
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:25,739
when you push the kids to the kill you

78
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,000
push on the right hand side when you

79
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:30,480
take it out you take it on the level

80
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,640
inside so now what's the kit of a take

81
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,739
it out what's the key level eight five

82
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,739
and seven we've seen five before seven

83
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:40,920
we we have seen it right 13.

84
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:44,280
13 to the 13 right okay

85
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:46,440
and what's the kit of 10. now we have

86
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,900
seen it before what's the Creed of seven

87
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:51,900
hey we have seen it before oh yeah yeah

88
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:55,080
you never know yeah okay okay and then

89
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:58,140
we take the 30 now okay 13. this is the

90
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:00,000
exit so we know the distance okay so

91
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,860
when we push the kid back to the queue

92
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,540
we know the distance right so for

93
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:06,060
example at the beginning we're pushing

94
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:08,760
the one and zero right I only push the

95
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:11,580
two we know the current distance is zero

96
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,620
so we press one so it'd be two one right

97
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:15,360
so every time we push the kick back to

98
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,639
the cube or you can store the distance

99
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,620
in a couple the first element is the

100
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:22,919
position the second element in the table

101
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,900
is the distance so when we find the axis

102
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:26,639
we know the distance the shortest

103
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,680
distance that's the purpose we talk

104
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:32,100
about two ways of professors starting

105
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:34,860
searching from the entrain okay find any

106
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:40,020
of the exit or we push all the axis back

107
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:42,000
to the kill we put a 12 0 and 13 zero

108
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,979
right and then we do this perfect search

109
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,419
from the axis until we find the entrance

110
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:47,580
this is one way okay

111
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:50,580
and we also talk about a hash set right

112
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:52,919
so we don't need to use the hash set

113
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:55,080
can you think about a way that we get

114
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:58,080
rid of the headset when we're about to

115
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:02,280
push it back to the queue we change the

116
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:05,040
cell to walls does it make sense we take

117
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:08,699
one out yeah we push it to keep two

118
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:12,360
right so two now is an empty cell right

119
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:14,040
so if we push it to the Q we change

120
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,160
immediately to walk

121
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:19,440
huh we just change it so the next time

122
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,000
this cell is not visited again right

123
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,280
make sense

124
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,740
yeah it doesn't make sense yeah because

125
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,080
we're only visiting once oh no you're

126
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:31,199
about to push the fair

127
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,840
position to the queue we mark it as War

128
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:37,080
so the next time it's not visited again

129
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,240
simple right perfect it's ultimate to

130
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,759
find a shortage path because Never by

131
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,680
never that's very straightforward so

132
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,900
look if there are two axes right if

133
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,960
there are two x's if this is exit this

134
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:51,300
is exit only to the person search level

135
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,580
by level when we find that exit this is

136
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:57,000
the shortest path because it's anointed

137
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:59,220
but if it's deficit it's not right when

138
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,259
we find it we might find this first

139
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:03,960
right but this is not the shortest this

140
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:05,400
is the shortest unless we exalt all the

141
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,620
parts I think we talk about that yeah

142
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:11,039
unless we

143
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:12,960
use the deficit to find all the paths to

144
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,840
the exit when we perform the temperature

145
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,820
we find this exit we don't stop here

146
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,500
because we haven't finished setting the

147
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:21,780
whole tree yet

148
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,520
and we finish this trip I know we found

149
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:27,960
two axis and we can compare the distance

150
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:29,160
obviously if we know Leia two axes and

151
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:32,100
then we use the different search

152
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,780
definite search and recursion usually we

153
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:36,840
talk about implementing the data as

154
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:40,800
usual recursion again we set up a search

155
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:43,620
we can use a headset or we can mark the

156
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,979
empty cell walls as long as we visit it

157
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:49,680
if I that was such a common position

158
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:52,199
rows column and then we have a distance

159
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,840
current distance and we can have a scene

160
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:57,660
table a scene headset right headset if

161
00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:02,460
is exit

162
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:04,800
ah C and if currently is RC and RC is

163
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:08,039
not equal to the entry right entry is a

164
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,800
total okay then we remember save the

165
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:12,720
answer at the beginning is infinity

166
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,840
save the answer

167
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,639
equals the mean when we find the exit We

168
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,400
compare with the minimum we attend the

169
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:23,160
minimum right saved answer

170
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:26,099
and then distance and then return okay

171
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:30,360
return true if we find it okay okay and

172
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:33,360
then now we have to check if RC in scene

173
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,360
well

174
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:40,560
this is very important in an unweighted

175
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:43,500
undirected graph in the binary tree we

176
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,139
don't usually worry about visiting again

177
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:49,199
finally three you visit two from one

178
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:51,720
right you don't go back one to two we

179
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,940
don't go back it's a directive but here

180
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:56,460
this is not because look three visit

181
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:59,160
four four can visit three three four

182
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:01,979
you're F4 right you can go to three and

183
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:05,460
you can come back so if I don't have a

184
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:07,979
headset or if I don't remember the notes

185
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:09,840
I have visited what happened you just

186
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:13,259
keep walking here or there and you never

187
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:15,180
get job done right this is the point of

188
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:18,780
using the headset and then the first

189
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:21,300
thing to to put it into the headset okay

190
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:23,120
and then we just need to go through the

191
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:28,680
neighbors for

192
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:33,060
brtc in four neighbors one zero zero one

193
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:37,380
minus one zero zero minus one and then n

194
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:39,839
r n c equals t r plus r d c plus c

195
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:42,539
please look for coordinates four tuples

196
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,820
is just means that four positions up

197
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:47,399
down left right okay and then obviously

198
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:51,120
if n r this has to be in the range

199
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:53,940
bigger than zero smaller than rows and

200
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,760
zero smaller than NC smaller than

201
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:59,279
columns okay this is the interesting

202
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:03,180
part okay so if that

203
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:05,160
and if maze nrnc

204
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:07,740
is not what

205
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:10,980
then we do this step and such step as

206
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:13,620
such a n r and C now because you know

207
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:16,740
this is Bluetooth and I can see D plus

208
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:18,480
one and then sing sing don't remove we

209
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:20,600
need to remove it we need to recover

210
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:25,740
this is very important why is that look

211
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:28,380
oh this is the path after we finish this

212
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:30,899
route we have to unset otherwise other

213
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:32,459
route might be affected this is very

214
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:36,180
important in terms as such when we

215
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:39,240
visited we mark it as visited and after

216
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:41,580
we install all the paths here we have to

217
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:44,220
unset it and look at that message we

218
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:46,920
perform a data search we are not saying

219
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:48,360
terminal here if I say if

220
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,700
if two then that's going to be a problem

221
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:53,279
because we are not actually stopping

222
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:55,320
once we find the exit right we want to

223
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,180
excel the paths right we talk about this

224
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:01,620
scene table right we don't need to use

225
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:03,120
it instead we can set it to maze RC

226
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:05,519
equal

227
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:08,940
what we change it to war and then we

228
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:12,260
unset it to Maze and R and C equals

229
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:15,720
empty set the first thing is that the

230
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:20,100
visited we have to mark it as visited

231
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:24,000
before and then we have to restore after

232
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:26,940
we can Mark a visit is there a war

233
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,339
instead of using a headset before we

234
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:31,680
recursive recording itself better search

235
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:33,360
we have to check if it's an empty cell

236
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,339
right if it's a wall we don't do that

237
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,959
basically you say well you you basically

238
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:39,180
can't go into the war right so there's

239
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,620
no point to calling right yeah you have

240
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:45,560
it mine in jail

241
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:45,560
what's that a drill a tree okay okay

242
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,779
there's a roof

243
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,880
I know there isn't

244
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:59,640
fine what if you have

245
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,680
a cannon why we need to restore it I

246
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,899
feel this speed a little bit complicated

247
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,660
to understand okay when we visit day

248
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:09,360
five we go to the left we go to the left

249
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:11,399
we have to mark it as this is visited

250
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,200
right so it doesn't go back right yeah

251
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:16,920
however

252
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:20,399
easy however if we finish the loot this

253
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:22,320
way right we have to unmark it a market

254
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,140
because there may be other rules that

255
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:28,260
will go go to this position

256
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:30,540
right make sense if we don't a market

257
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:32,880
what happened we probably can't go there

258
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,660
anymore but there's actually a path to

259
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,260
that

260
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:39,240
does it make sense uh

261
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:42,740
that's a good question okay that's a

262
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,740
good question let me draw something

263
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:49,079
spend a little bit longer and then put

264
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:51,660
one under so then you have to go

265
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:53,880
there that's right okay so look if this

266
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:55,620
is empty sale right and if this is a

267
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:59,339
task yeah so it might go this way right

268
00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:01,740
right however we should definitely

269
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:04,079
search you might go this way first right

270
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:05,100
but you'll be about a market what

271
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,440
happened

272
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,660
immediately this is why you mark it as a

273
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,399
really really recently but if you talk

274
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:14,760
about Market what happened this moon is

275
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:17,940
blocked makes sense yeah that's why we

276
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:20,339
finish it we have to unmark it here okay

277
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:22,920
it's a common mistake that people do

278
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:24,899
this deficits you may make okay so like

279
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:27,540
that's a search is easy to understand

280
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:28,860
but there's many many people when we

281
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:31,200
implement it the time convection

282
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:33,240
obviously this is much complicated and

283
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,899
breakfast because the perfect search

284
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:38,760
when we find the exit we stop but never

285
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:41,720
search for this one

286
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:44,339
in order to guarantee the minimum

287
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:46,920
shortage pass we have to exalt all those

288
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:49,399
parts okay next lesson what are we going

289
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,399
to talk about

290
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:00,720
we perform a deficit we set the depth to

291
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:02,720
two to form a deficit that's the three

292
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:06,120
we perform the density

293
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:09,120
zero we don't find it we increment the

294
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:11,279
depth to one we still don't find it we

295
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,860
implement the depth to two we find it

296
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,540
look we do the deficit we find this why

297
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,339
we don't find this one

298
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:19,620
why do we don't care about this one

299
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:21,240
because this one when we set depth

300
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:23,880
equals three

301
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:26,579
we have the high limit can't stop here

302
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:28,740
so you don't find this one right so you

303
00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:32,399
find this one instead okay yeah

304
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:34,320
okay so yeah let's iteration different

305
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:39,060
research okay that's it for today bye

306
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,060
bye bye bye yo
