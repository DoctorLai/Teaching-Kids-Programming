1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,560
hello mr hurry mr rhino right

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:07,520
what's this

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,480
a boundary tree finally three a tree a

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,960
tree

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:14,480
any aluminum grass a graph yes

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,720
this is the fine tree in 270 days we

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:22,080
talk about to get the

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:24,880
maximum average that's 274 days 274 days

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,800
subtree we want to find out on the day

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,359
we talk about the death search to find

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,720
out the maximum average of subtree look

12
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,120
at this note

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,239
this is a subtree right

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,600
the average is two this is average two

15
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,520
and these

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,800
average is also two two plus two plus

17
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:45,520
two divided by three probabilities

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,879
sub subtree so basically you add all the

19
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,960
numbers

20
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,239
and divide it by the number of the nodes

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,039
right and we want to find out the

22
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:55,039
maximum right and we use the data search

23
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,680
and then we want to find the maximum

24
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,000
two right let's see let's see what's the

25
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,320
this is this is two obviously

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,960
this is one yeah we have we have average

27
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,439
two one and what's the average of these

28
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:10,479
ten divided by one two three four five

29
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:13,439
also two right average this is seven

30
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:15,040
okay we got a winner what's the average

31
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,680
of the entire tree

32
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,040
five plus seven plus three

33
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,759
fifteen ten

34
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,479
fifteen plus one sixteen

35
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,960
sixteen plus six twenty two divided by

36
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,720
one two three four five six seven

37
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,119
twenty two divided by two divided by

38
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,040
seven so okay so it's roughly three

39
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,840
point something right so

40
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,759
the largest will be seven okay so have

41
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,280
you noticed what did i do you know the

42
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,280
two seven

43
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,880
that's seven this is excel with the

44
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,720
substrate so what in order to calculate

45
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,720
the average because there's seven

46
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,399
numbers

47
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,840
oh yeah these seven knobs yes you're

48
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:56,320
right okay so in order to calculate the

49
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:58,560
average what do we need to know

50
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,360
you need to know how many

51
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,200
and

52
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,040
and every

53
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,960
every night

54
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,119
the sum how do we calculate some i think

55
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,720
it's like exactly

56
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,520
the exact thing okay so what do this

57
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,840
mean sum sum sum divided by the number

58
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,560
of nodes yeah and we talk about the

59
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,800
depth search so in order to do this we

60
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,280
need this type of search function to

61
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,520
return two values can you guess what are

62
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,319
those you probably already know all

63
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,640
right

64
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,160
define definitely

65
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,560
root

66
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:34,160
and this is the maximum average okay

67
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,160
come on so if if it's an empty tree

68
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,040
we return to value can you tell me what

69
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,879
are these two values zero zero

70
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,200
what are these two values for the

71
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,400
definition to return zero zero what does

72
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,440
it mean

73
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,360
means

74
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,640
the sum sum

75
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,200
numbers

76
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,680
the numbers were n the n the number of

77
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,760
nodes yeah okay two values one for the

78
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:59,200
sum one for the number of nodes left sum

79
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,760
and left node equals definite search

80
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,800
blue dot left right

81
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,319
and then right s y n equals that's the

82
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,360
search can you tell me what what am i

83
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:11,360
doing here do the right

84
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,159
okay so now look we've got the four

85
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,760
values the left side left no number of

86
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,519
notes right sum

87
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,920
the sum of the

88
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,519
right trees and the number of the right

89
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,920
trees right and now we want to get the

90
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:27,040
maximum of the average we have this

91
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,040
answer equals maximum of answer this is

92
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,680
we want to get the maximum average right

93
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:35,680
so the average will be the sum left sum

94
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:39,120
plus right sum plus do the value right

95
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,000
and divided by left null plus right now

96
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,080
plus

97
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,640
so this bit the sum of the luxury

98
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:48,879
is

99
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:51,519
the sum of the right tree is rs and l s

100
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:54,000
plus rs plus root of value is the sum of

101
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,319
this entire tree okay

102
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,400
and then the number of nodes how so

103
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,879
what's missing here can you tell me the

104
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,640
left number of notes the number of the

105
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,879
notes in the left tree plus the number

106
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,760
of notes in the right three plus what's

107
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:11,280
the number of notes in the root how many

108
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:14,959
notes is in the loop one one

109
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,959
the number of notes in the loop come

110
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,479
okay so look this because we are

111
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,160
calculating the answer yeah but in order

112
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,360
to access this value we need to put a

113
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,680
longer

114
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,360
answer and then return

115
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,000
we want to return

116
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:35,199
we can again we we just need to return

117
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,040
these two values yes so this is 274 days

118
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,919
okay coming back to today's question so

119
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,800
we want to find out the number of nodes

120
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:44,000
that

121
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:48,080
is equals to the average of sub 3 so for

122
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,880
example the average of these three is 2x

123
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,680
so we count one two equals two how many

124
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,560
other nodes value is equals to the

125
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,000
average of that subtree can you find any

126
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,120
more

127
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,039
three

128
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,880
yeah of course the leaf node onto

129
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:06,320
counting the number of nodes that like

130
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:08,880
equals to the average of the subtree

131
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,960
so look the average of the leaf nodes

132
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:14,000
the average of this node

133
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,440
2 to a equals to except the average

134
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,280
number two

135
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,720
two okay up at least one three okay

136
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,280
how about this number

137
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:26,000
ten plus divided one two three four five

138
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,840
two so one is not equal to two so how

139
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,800
many notes one two three four will

140
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,000
return four that's what it means

141
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,240
okay

142
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,039
this is a different search look look at

143
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,600
this

144
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:40,800
this is the recursion

145
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:44,160
equivalent to find the largest the

146
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,240
maximum average of any sub tree right

147
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,680
we understand this approach to count how

148
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,080
many nodes

149
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,560
left equals to the average of that

150
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,039
subtree which line here is to calculate

151
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,039
the maximum average

152
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,840
the second last one

153
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,440
this one yeah okay good job so this one

154
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,800
is to get the average so we want to

155
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,800
change it

156
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,000
m plus r n plus one this is average

157
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,800
right

158
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,240
so if this is equal to rules of value so

159
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,639
if bluetooth value

160
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,160
equals this bit

161
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,520
length

162
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,639
answer

163
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,160
plus equal one that's it

164
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,720
doesn't make sense man

165
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,319
okay so what have you learned today

166
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,160
um

167
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,600
the problem is

168
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,560
that

169
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,560
there's a subtree

170
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,520
there's a tree yeah and we want to count

171
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,400
the nodes

172
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,880
the equal nodes to average

173
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,039
so we have a tree and

174
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:50,479
and we have the

175
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:52,319
want to calculate how much notes

176
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,560
uh like

177
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,639
have the subtree

178
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,919
of

179
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,599
the same value thing yeah okay and how

180
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,400
do we solve this

181
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,400
by using

182
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,240
different search okay so definite search

183
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,759
what's this

184
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,080
does the search what are these two

185
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,400
values

186
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,639
and the numbers of notes why do we need

187
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,160
to return a topic containing one of the

188
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,400
sum one of the

189
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,720
number of nodes what do we mean off

190
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,199
because then we can calculate the

191
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,360
average whether we can calculate average

192
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,400
and at this point we are calculating the

193
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,120
average

194
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,720
of the substrate of a loop right and

195
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,319
then if we just have to check if the

196
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,840
root of value

197
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:40,479
is equals to the average of that subtree

198
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:44,080
then we increment this answer right

199
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:46,800
this is basically the same as 274 days

200
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:50,160
which where we calculate maximum average

201
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:53,680
yeah this bit is the 274 day where we

202
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,280
use the recursive data search today

203
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,120
just slightly different you know the

204
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,599
code is pretty much the same except this

205
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,639
one right for that recursion that search

206
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:05,520
every time we return two values the sum

207
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,120
and the number of notes in the subtree

208
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,199
with these two values we can calculate

209
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,800
the average you can get this that

210
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,400
maximum average

211
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,479
or you can calculate

212
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,440
you can count how many nodes

213
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:20,319
the values equals to their average

214
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:23,440
the time convex the space complexity

215
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:25,440
time convexity or n because we visited

216
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,160
each node exactly once

217
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,960
the space compresses on right we're

218
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,519
using the recursion implies that

219
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:37,039
when calling stack the maximum number of

220
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:39,200
the recursion depth is n in a worst case

221
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,399
it will be a linked list if a final tree

222
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,240
is this way

223
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,320
look at the unknowns

224
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,279
or this way or it could be this way

225
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:50,000
right if the endnotes the step will be n

226
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:51,920
and that's the maximum number of the

227
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,920
stack usage okay that's it for today

228
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,920
bye-bye
