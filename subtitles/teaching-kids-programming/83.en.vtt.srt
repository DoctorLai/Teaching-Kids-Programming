i have an array some numbers

24
00:00:34,549 --> 00:00:34,559
i have an array some numbers
 

25
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,110
i have an array some numbers
some number at least of numbers or some

26
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:37,120
some number at least of numbers or some
 

27
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,150
some number at least of numbers or some
numbers okay

28
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:38,160
numbers okay
 

29
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:46,869
numbers okay
so look tttgcc

30
00:00:46,869 --> 00:00:46,879

 

31
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,910

well only one number appears once all

32
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:49,920
well only one number appears once all
 

33
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,790
well only one number appears once all
other numbers

34
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:50,800
other numbers
 

35
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,830
other numbers
appears twice yeah yeah

36
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:53,840
appears twice yeah yeah
 

37
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,110
appears twice yeah yeah
so the task is to find that

38
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:57,120
so the task is to find that
 

39
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,110
so the task is to find that
single number so this is single number

40
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:01,120
single number so this is single number
 

41
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,990
single number so this is single number
okay so any thoughts anything how we can

42
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:04,000
okay so any thoughts anything how we can
 

43
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,030
okay so any thoughts anything how we can
do this

00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:11,520
you just go on the first one and look
 

51
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,750
you just go on the first one and look
for it is it in this part

okay so basically basically
the numbers and check if it appears on

62
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:28,240
the numbers and check if it appears on
 

63
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,190
the numbers and check if it appears on
the if it

64
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:29,200
the if it
 

65
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,590

appears more than once yes you just
 

67
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,310
appears more than once yes you just
check like

68
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:32,320
check like
 

69
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,870

right that means that we find it
 

113
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,270
right that means that we find it
duplicate numbers now we need to set

114
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:51,280
duplicate numbers now we need to set
 

115
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,949

this out of

this out of

uh flag equals fours
 

119
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,509
uh flag equals fours
okay and then here uh every time we

120
00:02:59,509 --> 00:02:59,519
okay and then here uh every time we
 

121
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:00,149
okay and then here uh every time we
locate the

122
00:03:00,149 --> 00:03:00,159
locate the
 

123
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,630
locate the
i we say this flag equals two okay

124
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:04,640
i we say this flag equals two okay
 

125
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,550
i we say this flag equals two okay
and then we find this flag equals fours

126
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:06,560
and then we find this flag equals fours
 

127
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,990
and then we find this flag equals fours
means that it's not a

128
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,000
means that it's not a
 

129
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,309
means that it's not a
two it's not a single number we break it

130
00:03:10,309 --> 00:03:10,319
two it's not a single number we break it
 

131
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,030
two it's not a single number we break it
okay

132
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:11,040
okay
 

133
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,790
okay
and then here outside if flag

134
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:14,800
and then here outside if flag
 

135
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,229
and then here outside if flag
is left means that is the single number

136
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:18,239
is left means that is the single number
 

137
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,509
is left means that is the single number
then return return we can

138
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:21,519
then return return we can
 

139
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:27,350
then return return we can

141
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,550

here so basically look i with i is the

142
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:30,560
here so basically look i with i is the
 

143
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,710
here so basically look i with i is the
index yeah from zero one two three four

144
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:32,720
index yeah from zero one two three four
 

145
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,350

five
 

147
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,630
five
and then every time look

00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:36,640
and then every time look
 

149
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,990
and then every time look
every time i locate it at two i need to

every time i locate it at two i need to
 

151
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,110
every time i locate it at two i need to
find

find
 

153
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,670

i i need to find if the numbers other

154
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:43,680
i i need to find if the numbers other
 

155
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,710
i i need to find if the numbers other
than this number

156
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:44,720
than this number
 

157
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,390
than this number
equals to 2 right and if i find it

158
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:48,400
equals to 2 right and if i find it
 

159
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,509
equals to 2 right and if i find it
i set it to 4 which is which means that

160
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:51,519
i set it to 4 which is which means that
 

161
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,190
i set it to 4 which is which means that
it's not the number we want okay

162
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:53,200
it's not the number we want okay
 

163
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,190
it's not the number we want okay
and i break it and then if you frac

164
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:55,200
and i break it and then if you frac
 

165
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,509
and i break it and then if you frac
means that we can't find that

166
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:57,519
means that we can't find that
 

167
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,509
means that we can't find that
number twice that we do the service

168
00:03:59,509 --> 00:03:59,519
number twice that we do the service
 

169
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,990

00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:05,200
what happens if they need it sorry
 

173
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,149
what happens if they need it sorry
neither even

174
00:04:06,149 --> 00:04:06,159
neither even
 

175
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,830
neither even
eating anything yeah yeah yeah

176
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:09,840
eating anything yeah yeah yeah
 

177
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,030
eating anything yeah yeah yeah
let me know

178
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:15,040
let me know
 

179
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,710
let me know
yeah good question why happen if they're

180
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:16,720
yeah good question why happen if they're
 

181
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,069
yeah good question why happen if they're
not single numbers

182
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:18,079
not single numbers
 

183
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,270
not single numbers
but at this point i mean that there will

184
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:21,280
but at this point i mean that there will
 

185
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,469
but at this point i mean that there will
be a single number

186
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:22,479
be a single number
 

187
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,550
be a single number
so this is the requirement okay this is

188
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:24,560
so this is the requirement okay this is
 

189
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,310
so this is the requirement okay this is
the given okay do you get it

190
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:26,320
the given okay do you get it
 

191
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,990
the given okay do you get it
what's the time complexity i went i uh

192
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:30,000
what's the time complexity i went i uh
 

193
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,390
what's the time complexity i went i uh
now if you are looking at i and then you

194
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:32,400
now if you are looking at i and then you
 

195
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,270
now if you are looking at i and then you
need to

196
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:33,280
need to
 

197
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,670
need to
search for items this is n times this is

198
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:37,680
search for items this is n times this is
 

199
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,070
search for items this is n times this is
f

200
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,080
f
 

201
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,030
f
n squared with o n square what's the

202
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,040
n squared with o n square what's the
 

203
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,430
n squared with o n square what's the
what's the space complexity

204
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:43,440
what's the space complexity
 

205
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,590
what's the space complexity
and square oh one

206
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:47,600
and square oh one
 

207
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,189
and square oh one
one oh one yes

208
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:51,199

 

209
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,629

okay so can we do that can we do better

210
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:54,639
okay so can we do that can we do better
 

211
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,110
okay so can we do that can we do better
this time what i'm going to do better

212
00:04:59,110 --> 00:04:59,120

 

213
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,230

so it's better wait

214
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:02,240
so it's better wait
 

215
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,430
so it's better wait
let me yes you think about it

216
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:05,440
let me yes you think about it
 

217
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,830
let me yes you think about it
can we do better

218
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:08,840

 

219
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,710

yes so look we look for this number

220
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:12,720
yes so look we look for this number
 

221
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,670
yes so look we look for this number
and we said we we just need to find if

222
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:15,680
and we said we we just need to find if
 

223
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,189
and we said we we just need to find if
the number

224
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:17,199
the number
 

225
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,430
the number
appears more than once or not right so

226
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:19,440
appears more than once or not right so
 

227
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,830
appears more than once or not right so
how about we use the counter

228
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:21,840
how about we use the counter
 

229
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,350
how about we use the counter
a notebook oh yeah yeah

230
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:25,360
a notebook oh yeah yeah
 

231
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,629
a notebook oh yeah yeah
look look we can delete

232
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:28,639
look look we can delete
 

233
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,230
look look we can delete
all right

234
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:32,240

 

235
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,550

no book equals counter do you still

236
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:34,560
no book equals counter do you still
 

237
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,909
no book equals counter do you still
remember this character

238
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:35,919
remember this character
 

239
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,590
remember this character
counter numbs okay

240
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:39,600
counter numbs okay
 

241
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,629
counter numbs okay
and then for i

242
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:42,639
and then for i
 

243
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,710
and then for i
in notebook if

244
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:46,720
in notebook if
 

245
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,830
in notebook if
notebook no 4a in nums

246
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:49,840
notebook no 4a in nums
 

247
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:56,230
notebook no 4a in nums
okay therefore e i num

248
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:56,240

 

249
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,990

actually for i in notebook is okay for i

250
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,000
actually for i in notebook is okay for i
 

251
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,909
actually for i in notebook is okay for i
i uh for

252
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:03,919
i uh for
 

253
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,590
i uh for
value count in

254
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:07,600
value count in
 

255
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,629
value count in
enumerate okay enumerate

256
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:12,639

 

257
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,950

actually not enumerate it's actually in

258
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:14,960
actually not enumerate it's actually in
 

259
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,830
actually not enumerate it's actually in
i

260
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:15,840
i
 

261
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,830
i
uh enough okay notebook if

262
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:19,840
uh enough okay notebook if
 

263
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,749
uh enough okay notebook if
if c equals one means it only appears

264
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:23,759
if c equals one means it only appears
 

265
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,590
if c equals one means it only appears
one then we determine v

266
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:25,600
one then we determine v
 

267
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,990
one then we determine v
okay yeah that's it

268
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:30,000
okay yeah that's it
 

269
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,790
okay yeah that's it
do you get it

270
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:34,800
do you get it
 

271
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,270
do you get it
look at this counter so what happened

272
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:37,280
look at this counter so what happened
 

273
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,189
look at this counter so what happened
these two two three three one five five

274
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:39,199
these two two three three one five five
 

275
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,629
these two two three three one five five
what happened in this notebook

276
00:06:40,629 --> 00:06:40,639
what happened in this notebook
 

277
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,710
what happened in this notebook
notebook will be up up yet contains what

278
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:44,720
notebook will be up up yet contains what
 

279
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,990
notebook will be up up yet contains what
two two what's what two what's the value

280
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,000
two two what's what two what's the value
 

281
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,189
two two what's what two what's the value
of two

282
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:49,199
of two
 

283
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,790
of two
two three two

284
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:52,800
two three two
 

285
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,550
two three two
one one and five two so this is the

286
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:56,560
one one and five two so this is the
 

287
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,270
one one and five two so this is the
value

288
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:57,280
value
 

289
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,550
value
two three one five please stop at one

290
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:00,560
two three one five please stop at one
 

291
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,670
two three one five please stop at one
no no this this counter means that

292
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:03,680
no no this this counter means that
 

293
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,870
no no this this counter means that
it counts how many elements

294
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:06,880
it counts how many elements
 

295
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,589
it counts how many elements
in this array so look it has two how

296
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:09,599
in this array so look it has two how
 

297
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,510
in this array so look it has two how
many times it appears in an array

298
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:11,520
many times it appears in an array
 

299
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,070
many times it appears in an array
two two okay how many times appear for

300
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:14,080
two two okay how many times appear for
 

301
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,110
two two okay how many times appear for
the number three

302
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:15,120
the number three
 

303
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,270
the number three
ten how many times appears for number

304
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:17,280
ten how many times appears for number
 

305
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,230
ten how many times appears for number
one one

306
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:18,240
one one
 

307
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,629
one one
how many times well let me know yes and

308
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:20,639
how many times well let me know yes and
 

309
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:21,830
how many times well let me know yes and
then we go through these

310
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:21,840
then we go through these
 

311
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,469
then we go through these
these objects and then find out okay if

312
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:24,479
these objects and then find out okay if
 

313
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,629
these objects and then find out okay if
it's c equals one and we return this

314
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:26,639
it's c equals one and we return this
 

315
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,430
it's c equals one and we return this
okay yeah that's that's one way of doing

316
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:29,440
okay yeah that's that's one way of doing
 

317
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,029
okay yeah that's that's one way of doing
it okay

318
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:31,039
it okay
 

319
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,550
it okay
and you just add all of the notes

320
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:34,560
and you just add all of the notes
 

321
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,189
and you just add all of the notes
yeah you can all together and if it's

322
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:37,199
yeah you can all together and if it's
 

323
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:37,830
yeah you can all together and if it's
odd

324
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:37,840
odd
 

325
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,870
odd
then it must be your own numbers

326
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:40,880
then it must be your own numbers
 

327
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,150
then it must be your own numbers
now you can do this v i equals goes to

328
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:44,160
now you can do this v i equals goes to
 

329
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,189
now you can do this v i equals goes to
the numbers and

330
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:45,199
the numbers and
 

331
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,029
the numbers and
if notebook is the same thing as

332
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:47,039
if notebook is the same thing as
 

333
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,830
if notebook is the same thing as
notebook i equals one and returned

334
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:49,840
notebook i equals one and returned
 

335
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,990
notebook i equals one and returned
i okay it's the same thing okay you have

336
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:52,000
i okay it's the same thing okay you have
 

337
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,430
i okay it's the same thing okay you have
to go through these numbers

338
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:53,440
to go through these numbers
 

339
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,550
to go through these numbers
and if we check the counter notebook

340
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:56,560
and if we check the counter notebook
 

341
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,790
and if we check the counter notebook
if it's valuable as one means it only

342
00:07:58,790 --> 00:07:58,800
if it's valuable as one means it only
 

343
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,270
if it's valuable as one means it only
appears one yeah

344
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:01,280
appears one yeah
 

345
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,749
appears one yeah
okay yes how about

346
00:08:05,749 --> 00:08:05,759
okay yes how about
 

347
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,070
okay yes how about
how about we use the exclusive or do you

348
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:08,080
how about we use the exclusive or do you
 

349
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,189
how about we use the exclusive or do you
still remember this

350
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:11,199

 

351
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,110

one and one is yellow zero and zero

352
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:15,120
one and one is yellow zero and zero
 

353
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,469
one and one is yellow zero and zero
is zero one and zero is one zero and one

354
00:08:18,469 --> 00:08:18,479
is zero one and zero is one zero and one
 

355
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:18,950
is zero one and zero is one zero and one
is

356
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:18,960
is
 

357
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,150
is
one okay please still remember yeah this

358
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:22,160
one okay please still remember yeah this
 

359
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,629
one okay please still remember yeah this
x

360
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:22,639
x
 

361
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,589
x
y this is x y this is x exclusive y

362
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:27,599
y this is x y this is x exclusive y
 

363
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,270
y this is x y this is x exclusive y
okay so

364
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:31,280
okay so
 

365
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,230
okay so
it means that if it's the same it's

366
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:34,240
it means that if it's the same it's
 

367
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:34,709
it means that if it's the same it's
nothing

368
00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:34,719
nothing
 

369
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,670
nothing
right if it's the same it's zero right

370
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:37,680
right if it's the same it's zero right
 

371
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,630
right if it's the same it's zero right
yeah

372
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:38,640
yeah
 

373
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,870
yeah
okay so look if it's different it's one

374
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:40,880
okay so look if it's different it's one
 

375
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,790
okay so look if it's different it's one
okay so look

376
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:42,800
okay so look
 

377
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,710
okay so look
there are only one number every look at

378
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:44,720
there are only one number every look at
 

379
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,710
there are only one number every look at
me look ryan look at me if

380
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:46,720
me look ryan look at me if
 

381
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,350
me look ryan look at me if
there's only one number only one number

382
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:49,360
there's only one number only one number
 

383
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,190
there's only one number only one number
that's different right

384
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:51,200
that's different right
 

385
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,230
that's different right
this one is appears one yes and all

386
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:54,240
this one is appears one yes and all
 

387
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,389
this one is appears one yes and all
the numbers appear twice so what happen

388
00:08:56,389 --> 00:08:56,399
the numbers appear twice so what happen
 

389
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,389
the numbers appear twice so what happen
if you exclusive oh

390
00:08:58,389 --> 00:08:58,399
if you exclusive oh
 

391
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,150
if you exclusive oh
those two numbers

392
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:02,160

 

393
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,750

what happened if you exclusively

394
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:03,760
what happened if you exclusively
 

395
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,509
what happened if you exclusively
exclusively excuse me

396
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:05,519
exclusively excuse me
 

397
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,710
exclusively excuse me
what did i just say even the same you'll

398
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:08,720
what did i just say even the same you'll
 

399
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,829
what did i just say even the same you'll
become

400
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:09,839
become
 

401
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,710
become
zero okay so what's the result if i

402
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:12,720
zero okay so what's the result if i
 

403
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,389
zero okay so what's the result if i
exclusive all the numbers what's the

404
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:14,399
exclusive all the numbers what's the
 

405
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,190
exclusive all the numbers what's the
reason

406
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:17,200

 

407
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,590

the result will be one will be the

408
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:19,600
the result will be one will be the
 

409
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,829
the result will be one will be the
number we're looking for

410
00:09:20,829 --> 00:09:20,839
number we're looking for
 

411
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,550
number we're looking for
yeah remember previous is what i forgot

412
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:24,560
yeah remember previous is what i forgot
 

413
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,430
yeah remember previous is what i forgot
to say the

414
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:25,440
to say the
 

415
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:31,110
to say the
counter thing what's the time complexity

416
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:31,120

 

417
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,350

oh oh n come on because we need to

418
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:33,360
oh oh n come on because we need to
 

419
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,550
oh oh n come on because we need to
iterate once yeah

420
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:38,560

00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:51,360
if it's news in space it's all no come

00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,190

okay so this one

430
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:57,200

 

431
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,230

so can you write it look x equal

432
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:00,240
so can you write it look x equal
 

433
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:08,150
so can you write it look x equal
c l and then for

434
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:08,160

 

435
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,190

what should i do here x equals one

436
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:11,200
what should i do here x equals one
 

437
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,310
what should i do here x equals one
x equals x one i and return y

438
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:14,320
x equals x one i and return y
 

439
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,590
x equals x one i and return y
can you can you write this can you guess

440
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:18,600
can you can you write this can you guess
 

441
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:30,949
can you can you write this can you guess

excused by x we have written

444
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:34,240
excused by x we have written
 

445
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,550
excused by x we have written
is right exclusive or all the numbers

446
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:36,560
is right exclusive or all the numbers
 

447
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,630
is right exclusive or all the numbers
the numbers is that we looking for so

448
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:38,640
the numbers is that we looking for so
 

449
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,710
the numbers is that we looking for so
the exclusive return answer is

450
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:42,720
the exclusive return answer is
 

451
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:52,710
the exclusive return answer is
what numbers are we doing here

452
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:52,720

 

453
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,190

so look what's the time complexity

454
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:56,200
so look what's the time complexity

what's um come on n o n because we are
 

459
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,350
what's um come on n o n because we are
iterating these numbers only once yes

iterating these numbers only once yes
 

461
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,350
iterating these numbers only once yes
yes got it yeah what's a space

462
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:07,360

are we using anything new one come on

466
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:13,360
are we using anything new one come on
 

467
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,630
are we using anything new one come on
okay i just said it before okay then

468
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:16,640
okay i just said it before okay then
 

469
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,990
okay i just said it before okay then
you can actually look

470
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:20,000
you can actually look
 

471
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,470
you can actually look
that therefore you can you can just

472
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:22,480
that therefore you can you can just
 

473
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,389
that therefore you can you can just
simply using this return

474
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:24,399
simply using this return
 

475
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,269
simply using this return
reduce as a function okay reduce reduce

476
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:27,279
reduce as a function okay reduce reduce
 

477
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,150
reduce as a function okay reduce reduce
means that

478
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:28,160
means that
 

479
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,150
means that
i want to reduce all this into one

480
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:30,160
i want to reduce all this into one
 

481
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,829
i want to reduce all this into one
single number okay

482
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:31,839
single number okay
 

483
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,269
single number okay
so here's what reduce i i can

484
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:35,279
so here's what reduce i i can
 

485
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,750
so here's what reduce i i can
pass a function in there okay let's say

486
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:37,760
pass a function in there okay let's say
 

487
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,110
pass a function in there okay let's say
i can pass the function

488
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:39,120
i can pass the function
 

489
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,630
i can pass the function
f here and then the numbers and given

490
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:42,640
f here and then the numbers and given
 

491
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,550
f here and then the numbers and given
the star with the zero so this

492
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:44,560
the star with the zero so this
 

493
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,910
the star with the zero so this
f thing is i can write it define f

494
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:47,920
f thing is i can write it define f
 

495
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,990
f thing is i can write it define f
a b return

496
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:52,000
a b return
 

497
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,269
a b return
a exclusive or b okay so look remember

498
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:55,279
a exclusive or b okay so look remember
 

499
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,069
a exclusive or b okay so look remember
that therefore

500
00:11:56,069 --> 00:11:56,079
that therefore
 

501
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,829
that therefore
fourth thing for loop thing yes

502
00:11:59,829 --> 00:11:59,839
fourth thing for loop thing yes
 

503
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,990
fourth thing for loop thing yes
it's the same thing as this yeah you

504
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:02,000
it's the same thing as this yeah you
 

505
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,870
it's the same thing as this yeah you
define a function

506
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:02,880
define a function
 

507
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,910
define a function

that i want to reduce
the array into a single value

514
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:14,800
the array into a single value
 

515
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,069
the array into a single value
which let's start initialized by

516
00:12:18,069 --> 00:12:18,079
which let's start initialized by
 

517
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,590
which let's start initialized by
zero and then i take these

518
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:21,600
zero and then i take these
 

519
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,670

the way how we reduce it okay so

520
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:23,680
the way how we reduce it okay so
 

521
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,790
the way how we reduce it okay so
basically it's the same

basically it's the same
 

523
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,069
basically it's the same
okay and then basically so you f you can

524
00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:28,079
okay and then basically so you f you can
 

525
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,750
okay and then basically so you f you can
right because it's a one-man thing you

526
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:29,760
right because it's a one-man thing you
 

527
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,750
right because it's a one-man thing you
can just do it return lambda

528
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:31,760
can just do it return lambda
 

529
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:45,510
