1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
yo

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,200
hello hello guys hello mister with mr

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,680
ryan all right okay so let's talk look

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,480
at this mess a to the power of a equals

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:13,200
2 to the power of 2048

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,560
a is an integer obviously okay

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,240
a is is integer it's integer

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,840
is integer

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,920
okay integer bigger than zero okay

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,599
obviously obviously bigger than zero

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,840
okay bigger than zero

12
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:34,000
a is bigger than zero

13
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:34,000
okay so have a guess what's a

14
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,879
is it is it 100 is it one

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,239
no

16
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,559
two

17
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,559
three

18
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,840
obviously because it's too small yeah

19
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,840
how about eight

20
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,120
definitely

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,000
not okay

22
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,760
how about a hundred we don't know yeah

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,440
we don't know right

24
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,920
okay so yeah

25
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,520
this this is a very huge number it means

26
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,040
that we multiply two

27
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,799
2048 times yes two times two times two

28
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,720
times two how many times of two two

29
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:12,280
thousand and thirty eight times which

30
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:15,759
equals 496.

31
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:18,799
4096 that's 2 times 2048 that's right

32
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,080
but no because that means that they are

33
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,880
these means

34
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,400
2 times 2 times 2

35
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,000
how many of 2

36
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,000
2048

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,520
okay that's the power two to the power

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,640
of left okay so let me show you

39
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,240
uh

40
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,880
a to the power of b times c

41
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,920
right what does it equal

42
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,920
this is base it's actually equals a to

43
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,320
the power of b

44
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,920
then to the power of c okay how can i

45
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,280
interpret this

46
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,600
3 to the power of

47
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,920
2 times

48
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,040
three okay this is equal to three to the

49
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,479
power of

50
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,840
six right

51
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,640
yeah

52
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,799
yeah

53
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,240
it's actually equals to three to the

54
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,040
power of two

55
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,959
to the three so this equals nine to the

56
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,560
power of three

57
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,800
is it the same like

58
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,720
six three together

59
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,959
times together now that's six of three

60
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,239
one two three four five six how many

61
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,480
nines

62
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,720
three nine yeah

63
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,319
yeah so these two here

64
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,319
these two yeah

65
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:32,480
these two here yeah got it you get it so

66
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:35,599
a to the power a to the power of b times

67
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,720
c equals to we can do these two together

68
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,239
and then

69
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,560
to the power of c

70
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,720
okay so how does that help us

71
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,440
how does that help us look

72
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:50,040
2 to the power of

73
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:50,040
2048 is equals to 2 times

74
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,440
look at this yeah

75
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,519
yeah

76
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,319
so if i do this together

77
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,080
that equals 4 to the power of

78
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,480
10 24 right

79
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,879
so this thing is equal to this thing

80
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,720
okay so keep going

81
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,080
this equals to what

82
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,280
1024 equals 2 times

83
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:14,480
515 right

84
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:17,120
512 right so if i do this together

85
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,800
that will be 16 to the power of

86
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,760
512 right

87
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,800
yeah

88
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:25,440
okay so can you get the next one

89
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,519
next one so this is equals to 16 to the

90
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,040
power of 2 times

91
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:34,239
256 right

92
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:37,360
yeah so we can do these two together

93
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,360
16 times 16

94
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:47,599
oh it's there it's almost 2048. 16 times

95
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:51,159
60. 256. yeah okay so it's 256 times

96
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:54,159
to the power of 256 okay what's a

97
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:57,280
256 exactly okay that's how we get it

98
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:59,280
yeah let's mathematics but

99
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,360
one of the important thing today is this

100
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,959
a to the power of b times c equals a to

101
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,040
the power b we can do this together and

102
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,840
to the power of c okay yeah

103
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,920
yeah

104
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,599
very beautifully

105
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,360
we get it yeah

106
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,840
so we know b

107
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,879
a is

108
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,440
256 to the point

109
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:20,560
these two numbers are equal it's very

110
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,880
huge numbers we don't know yeah

111
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,720
okay so the other way

112
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,800
this is mathematic we we can ask

113
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,600
computer to to find this value right we

114
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,600
can ask computer to prove us this right

115
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:37,199
yeah about blue force you know

116
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:39,600
156 times 256 200

117
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,000
250 okay so look

118
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,960
a to the power of a equals b so a must

119
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,240
be

120
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,800
smaller or equal than 200 for uh

121
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,440
2048 right obviously yeah if this is

122
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,720
2048

123
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:57,840
2048 2048 is obviously bigger than 2 to

124
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:01,680
the power of 248 right so the upper

125
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:05,120
bound is 220 48 so we can just

126
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,919
ask computer to search the a from 1 to

127
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,840
20 for there right yeah

128
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,199
or we can find the research

129
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,960
yeah you don't know what's final

130
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,680
research

131
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,039
guess the number one to a hundred

132
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,000
guess the number you always find the

133
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:22,000
middle one fifty fifty if it's if i tell

134
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,039
you the number

135
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,400
in my mind is bigger than 50.

136
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,759
so

137
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,759
[Music]

138
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,199
yeah yeah you always find that yeah you

139
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,520
got it you're searching

140
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,840
upper pump if i i'm saying okay the

141
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,919
number in my mind is

142
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,520
smaller than 50. you search in a lower

143
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:44,639
half right always cut enough okay so

144
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,479
25 yeah exactly always find find one in

145
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,639
the middle so

146
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:52,800
for follow one in

147
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:56,240
four one uh in linear so for a in range

148
00:05:52,800 --> 00:06:01,600
and that's range 1 to 249

149
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:04,240
248 20 48 then if a times a

150
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,880
okay eight times time a okay let's do

151
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,000
the power and we talk about that

152
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,960
a

153
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,039
time multiply multiply b is the same is

154
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,080
the same as a to the power b and then

155
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,520
you can write math the power a b this is

156
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,800
the same thing here

157
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,919
okay if a

158
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,319
multiply multiply a equals two

159
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,560
multiply multiply

160
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:29,199
to twenty forty eight and then we return

161
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,960
a right easy this is the linear search

162
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,880
meaning

163
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,919
linear okay but we can do a binary

164
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,639
research

165
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:39,120
final research

166
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:42,800
so the lower bound is one right low

167
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,720
about is low about is one upper bound is

168
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:48,000
20 48

169
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,360
final research why the left and right do

170
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,160
not meet

171
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,800
yeah

172
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,880
why the left and right the window look

173
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,360
left and right do not meet

174
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,599
air smaller equivalent right

175
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,400
length meter equals

176
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:04,240
l plus r divided by two right divided by

177
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,720
two okay

178
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:10,000
find that in the left or you can do this

179
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,639
r plus a plus r shift is fifty one this

180
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,560
is

181
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,919
same thing okay m n

182
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,199
equals m

183
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,639
multiply

184
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,840
let's do the problem

185
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:23,440
power m to the power of n okay

186
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:25,840
then if mm equal equal

187
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,400
2 to the power of

188
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,960
2 to the power of 2 multiplied to the

189
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,039
power of 20 2048 then we find this

190
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,880
number return mn right

191
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:38,720
okay okay now you tell me

192
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:40,639
if this number mm is bigger than

193
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,199
this number okay bigger than 2 to the

194
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:46,000
power of 2048

195
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:48,720
right so look

196
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,400
if if this number is bigger than that so

197
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,599
what what does it mean

198
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,759
look here

199
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,639
this is the middle yeah yeah this is

200
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,120
middle

201
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,280
all right if this number

202
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,039
to about if m n

203
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,160
if m m

204
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,879
if the

205
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,720
we are guessing this m now but if this

206
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:10,000
m to the power of m is actually bigger

207
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,960
than 2 2 to the power of 20 48 so which

208
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,120
half

209
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,759
which half is this

210
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,360
then it has to be

211
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,199
left

212
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,360
which one left or right

213
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,479
come on if this number m to the power of

214
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,160
m

215
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:27,199
is bigger than

216
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:29,360
2 to the power of 20 48

217
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,360
so

218
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,599
this number is bigger

219
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,599
than this

220
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,320
left so we should look for the left

221
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:41,760
right so for leveling b

222
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:44,000
r will be equals to n minus one as let

223
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,480
us look if it's smaller than

224
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,560
if it's smaller than that so which

225
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,959
way should we look for

226
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:54,399
which half is this number

227
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:58,520
right right so a is what

228
00:08:54,399 --> 00:09:01,440
s1 or else look this is l this is r so

229
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:04,800
[Music]

230
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:07,040
where that exactly i wanted to meet

231
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,040
okay

232
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,880
final research what's a tandem

233
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:16,080
breastfeed

234
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,880
usually a organ oh logan yeah oh logan

235
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,880
okay

236
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,120
but here look because we already know

237
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,040
the outlaw about upper bound so in this

238
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,640
case the term convexity is one okay

239
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,320
you're right yeah

240
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,040
but do you understand the reason behind

241
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,160
it

242
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,920
yeah you sure okay why is it the one

243
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:35,200
because look the lower bar and upper

244
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:38,480
body is already we already know

245
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,959
we already know with the the maximum

246
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,959
that the search space is between the one

247
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,160
to two and twenty forty eight right but

248
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,560
you are also right

249
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,640
what i meant is that when this

250
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,720
you know when they are end generally end

251
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,519
you do this smoking okay

252
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,560
yeah

253
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,680
log

254
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,360
log 2

255
00:09:53,680 --> 00:10:00,720
2 20 48 what's this number

256
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,079
2 to the power of x equals 20 48 how

257
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,839
many how many

258
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:07,040
what's

259
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:08,000
x 2 to the power of 10 equals 10 24.

260
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,240
what's

261
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:15,600
what's x

262
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:17,440
how many more 10 24 times 1 equals 20 48

263
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,519
okay so how many more twos i need to

264
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,880
multiply

265
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,160
how many more

266
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:26,399
twos one yeah so two to the power of one

267
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,000
equals twenty ten forty eight eleven

268
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,959
exactly

269
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,720
okay

270
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,399
for today

271
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,800
bye bye

272
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,800
bye bye

273
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,320
bye okay that's it
