00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,070
we're done we're done okay so let's move
down

8
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:10,080
down
 

9
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,669
down
one two two three

10
00:00:13,669 --> 00:00:13,679
one two two three
 

11
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,029
one two two three
two four okay so this is the

12
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:17,039
two four okay so this is the
 

13
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,510
two four okay so this is the
royal numbers what's the maximum one

14
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:21,520
royal numbers what's the maximum one
 

15
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,550
royal numbers what's the maximum one
four four what's the minimum one what's

16
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:24,560
four four what's the minimum one what's
 

17
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,269
four four what's the minimum one what's
the

18
00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:25,279
the
 

19
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,710
the
average

20
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:28,720

 

21
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,630

average you add all these numbers

22
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:30,640
average you add all these numbers
 

23
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,030
average you add all these numbers
divided by one two three four five six

24
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:33,040
divided by one two three four five six
 

25
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,389
divided by one two three four five six
yeah okay let's average right

26
00:00:36,389 --> 00:00:36,399
yeah okay let's average right
 

27
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,950
yeah okay let's average right
sum divided by numbers that's average

28
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:38,960
sum divided by numbers that's average
 

29
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,709
sum divided by numbers that's average
okay

30
00:00:40,709 --> 00:00:40,719
okay
 

31
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,389
okay
yeah it doesn't make sense one three

32
00:00:44,389 --> 00:00:44,399
yeah it doesn't make sense one three
 

33
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,310
yeah it doesn't make sense one three
five eight yo you're okay with this

34
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:48,320
five eight yo you're okay with this
 

35
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,029
five eight yo you're okay with this
concept yeah okay so what's the

36
00:00:51,029 --> 00:00:51,039
concept yeah okay so what's the
 

37
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,950
concept yeah okay so what's the
what's medium remember what's medium

38
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:54,960
what's medium remember what's medium
 

39
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,150
what's medium remember what's medium
what's medium medium is used

40
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:58,160
what's medium medium is used
 

41
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,189
what's medium medium is used
you saw these numbers right if if

42
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:01,199
you saw these numbers right if if
 

43
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,910
you saw these numbers right if if
one two three what's the medium

44
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:05,920
one two three what's the medium
 

45
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,910
one two three what's the medium
if it's odd number you pick the middle

46
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:07,920
if it's odd number you pick the middle
 

47
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,990
if it's odd number you pick the middle
one it's in the salted one right

48
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:10,000
one it's in the salted one right
 

49
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,109
one it's in the salted one right
how about one two three four what's the

50
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:13,119
how about one two three four what's the
 

51
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:13,750
how about one two three four what's the
medium

52
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:13,760
medium
 

53
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,429
medium
medium what's the medium

54
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:19,439

 

55
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,510

do you still remember you picked in the

56
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:21,520
do you still remember you picked in the
 

57
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,190
do you still remember you picked in the
salted you saw these numbers yeah one

58
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:23,200
salted you saw these numbers yeah one
 

59
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,670
salted you saw these numbers yeah one
two three

60
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:23,680
two three
 

61
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,910
two three
you'll pick the meter two even number

62
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:25,920
you'll pick the meter two even number
 

63
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,109
you'll pick the meter two even number
yeah

64
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:27,119
yeah
 

65
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,109
yeah
you add it together divide by 2 which is

66
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:29,119
you add it together divide by 2 which is
 

67
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,190
you add it together divide by 2 which is
2.5 that's medium

68
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:31,200
2.5 that's medium
 

69
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,030
2.5 that's medium
got it okay so today we're going to

70
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:33,040
got it okay so today we're going to
 

71
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,469
got it okay so today we're going to
introduce another concept called

72
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:34,479
introduce another concept called
 

73
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,469
introduce another concept called
mode mount

74
00:01:38,469 --> 00:01:38,479
mode mount
 

75
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,550
mode mount
what's mode oh

76
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:42,560

 

77
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,270

yeah it's true yeah it's the most up

78
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:45,280
yeah it's true yeah it's the most up
 

79
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:45,749
yeah it's true yeah it's the most up
yeah

80
00:01:45,749 --> 00:01:45,759
yeah
 

81
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,069
yeah
appearing yeah most appealing one which

82
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:48,079
appearing yeah most appealing one which
 

83
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,109
appearing yeah most appealing one which
is three two

84
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:49,119
is three two
 

85
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,710
is three two
okay i'll get two appears three times so

86
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:50,720
okay i'll get two appears three times so
 

87
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,870
okay i'll get two appears three times so
it's not okay okay so that's a little

88
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:52,880
it's not okay okay so that's a little
 

89
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,870
it's not okay okay so that's a little
review so

90
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:56,880
review so
 

91
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,550
review so
another concept lucky number

92
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:00,560
another concept lucky number
 

93
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,030
another concept lucky number
lucky number okay so lucky number is

94
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:03,040
lucky number okay so lucky number is
 

95
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,590
lucky number okay so lucky number is
that

96
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:05,600

 

97
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,389

uh no no no no let's put it into three

98
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:08,399
uh no no no no let's put it into three
 

99
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:08,949
uh no no no no let's put it into three
okay

100
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:08,959
okay
 

101
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,470
okay
so what's how many times one appears

102
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:12,480
so what's how many times one appears
 

103
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,309
so what's how many times one appears
one how many times two appears

104
00:02:16,309 --> 00:02:16,319
one how many times two appears
 

105
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,470
one how many times two appears
how many times three appears three how

106
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:18,480
how many times three appears three how
 

107
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,710
how many times three appears three how
many times four up here one

108
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:20,720
many times four up here one
 

109
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,190
many times four up here one
okay so if they they appear the same

110
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:23,200
okay so if they they appear the same
 

111
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,030
okay so if they they appear the same
number of times equals to the

112
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:25,040
number of times equals to the
 

113
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,110
number of times equals to the
value itself it's called lucky number

114
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:27,120
value itself it's called lucky number
 

115
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,150
value itself it's called lucky number
right

116
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,160
right
 

117
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,630
right
that one and that one that one and the

118
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:30,640
that one and that one that one and the
 

119
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,350
that one and that one that one and the
one yeah

120
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:31,360
one yeah
 

121
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,750
one yeah
and we find we need to return the

122
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:33,760
and we find we need to return the
 

123
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,670
and we find we need to return the
largest one which is two

124
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:35,680
largest one which is two
 

125
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,070
largest one which is two
does it make sense yeah so if a number

126
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:38,080
does it make sense yeah so if a number
 

127
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:38,949
does it make sense yeah so if a number
appears

128
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:38,959
appears
 

129
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,910
appears
n times and then if the value is n then

130
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:41,920
n times and then if the value is n then
 

131
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,070
n times and then if the value is n then
it's a lucky number and we need to find

132
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:44,080
it's a lucky number and we need to find
 

133
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,110
it's a lucky number and we need to find
the number of the yeah doesn't have to

134
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:47,120
the number of the yeah doesn't have to
 

135
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,229
the number of the yeah doesn't have to
be sorted

136
00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:48,239
be sorted
 

137
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,190
be sorted
no it doesn't know how about one and one

138
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:51,200
no it doesn't know how about one and one
 

139
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,790
no it doesn't know how about one and one
one and one will be two times then it's

140
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:52,800
one and one will be two times then it's
 

141
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,309
one and one will be two times then it's
not a lucky number and sometimes it

142
00:02:54,309 --> 00:02:54,319
not a lucky number and sometimes it
 

143
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,750
not a lucky number and sometimes it
doesn't have this number and return

144
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:55,760
doesn't have this number and return
 

145
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,949
doesn't have this number and return
minus one right

146
00:02:56,949 --> 00:02:56,959
minus one right
 

147
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,070
minus one right
for example one

148
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,080
for example one
 

149
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,430
for example one
one two okay one appears how many times

150
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:03,440
one two okay one appears how many times
 

151
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,589
one two okay one appears how many times
two two appears how many times one so

152
00:03:05,589 --> 00:03:05,599
two two appears how many times one so
 

153
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:06,790
two two appears how many times one so
there's no lucky number

154
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:06,800
there's no lucky number
 

155
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,750
there's no lucky number
minus one okay minus one yeah doesn't

156
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:09,760
minus one okay minus one yeah doesn't
 

157
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,949
minus one okay minus one yeah doesn't
make sense

158
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:10,959
make sense
 

159
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,070
make sense
yeah okay so how can we do this how can

160
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:14,080
yeah okay so how can we do this how can
 

161
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,949
yeah okay so how can we do this how can
we do this

162
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:14,959
we do this
 

163
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:26,229
we do this
any idea there are a couple ways to

164
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:26,239

 

165
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,229

how do we use the object in star wars

166
00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:30,239
how do we use the object in star wars
 

167
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,030
how do we use the object in star wars

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,110
yeah what does it contain it contains
how many numbers the key and the value

194
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:25,120
how many numbers the key and the value
 

195
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,950
how many numbers the key and the value
yeah what key is the number

196
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:26,960
yeah what key is the number
 

197
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,870
yeah what key is the number
and the value is the number of times

198
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:28,880
and the value is the number of times
 

199
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,230
and the value is the number of times
they appear yeah

200
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:30,240
they appear yeah
 

201
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,350
they appear yeah
okay and then now what should we do

202
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:33,360
okay and then now what should we do
 

203
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,870
okay and then now what should we do
what should we do look we can appear we

204
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:36,880
what should we do look we can appear we
 

205
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,830
what should we do look we can appear we
can put it the

206
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:37,840
can put it the
 

207
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,189
can put it the
order we can put all the

208
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:41,199
order we can put all the
 

209
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,110
order we can put all the
put all the lucky number in this list

210
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:43,120
put all the lucky number in this list
 

211
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,990
put all the lucky number in this list
first okay so let's do this for

212
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:46,000
first okay so let's do this for
 

213
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,030
first okay so let's do this for
i in in one

214
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:49,040
i in in one
 

215
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,550
i in in one
in c right the interval is the key

216
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:52,560
in c right the interval is the key
 

217
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,310
in c right the interval is the key
if the key equals

218
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:56,320
if the key equals
 

219
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,430
if the key equals
the value of ci right and i put it

220
00:04:59,430 --> 00:04:59,440
the value of ci right and i put it
 

221
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,749
the value of ci right and i put it
push it into we found a lucky number

222
00:05:01,749 --> 00:05:01,759
push it into we found a lucky number
 

223
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,550
push it into we found a lucky number
right

224
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:02,560
right
 

225
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,430
right
i is the value c i is the number of

226
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:05,440
i is the value c i is the number of
 

227
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,510
i is the value c i is the number of
times they appear right

228
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:07,520

answer a pen
 

231
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,629
answer a pen
i right and then we need to

232
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:14,639
i right and then we need to
 

233
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,909
i right and then we need to
look if answer if there is a lucky

234
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:17,919
look if answer if there is a lucky
 

235
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,710
look if answer if there is a lucky
number then return

236
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:20,720
number then return
 

237
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,350
number then return
max we want to determine the maximum

238
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:23,360
max we want to determine the maximum
 

239
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,230

right
 

241
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,629
right
yeah and then return minus one here

242
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:26,639
yeah and then return minus one here
 

243
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:27,590
yeah and then return minus one here
right

00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:38,080
is a lucky number
 

303
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,270
is a lucky number
we return maximum moving right yeah

304
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:41,280
we return maximum moving right yeah
 

305
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,909
we return maximum moving right yeah
otherwise we will ten minus one and we

306
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:43,919
otherwise we will ten minus one and we
 

307
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,510
otherwise we will ten minus one and we
can also

uh no no maybe we need to do this two
 

329
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,749
uh no no maybe we need to do this two
steps i saw

330
00:07:15,749 --> 00:07:15,759
steps i saw
 

331
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,469
steps i saw
look here this one yeah we can do this

332
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:18,479
look here this one yeah we can do this
 

333
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,309
look here this one yeah we can do this
we can put it we can combine these two

334
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:20,319
we can put it we can combine these two
 

335
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,110
we can put it we can combine these two
into one

336
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:21,120
into one
 

337
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,710
into one
one sentence answer equals

338
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:24,720
one sentence answer equals
 

339
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,749
one sentence answer equals
what i for

340
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:27,759
what i for
 

341
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,029
what i for
i in c if i

342
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:31,039
i in c if i
 

343
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,629
i in c if i
equal equals c i i right

344
00:07:34,629 --> 00:07:34,639
equal equals c i i right
 

345
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,150
equal equals c i i right
you see so this is the least

346
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:36,160
you see so this is the least
 

347
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,909
you see so this is the least
comprehension

348
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:37,919
comprehension
 

349
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,629
comprehension
so look i i create a list which is

350
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:40,639
so look i i create a list which is
 

351
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:41,189
so look i i create a list which is
contents

352
00:07:41,189 --> 00:07:41,199
contents
 

353
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,869
contents
element i but what is i is in c

354
00:07:44,869 --> 00:07:44,879
element i but what is i is in c
 

355
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,790
element i but what is i is in c
and what condition if i equals yeah so

356
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:46,800
and what condition if i equals yeah so
 

357
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,950
and what condition if i equals yeah so
it's the same thing as this right

358
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:48,960
it's the same thing as this right
 

359
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,550
it's the same thing as this right
all right doesn't make sense yeah but

360
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:50,560
all right doesn't make sense yeah but
 

361
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,550
all right doesn't make sense yeah but
you're not trying to you're not required

sugars you know what syntax yoga a much
neat way to write it but this is also

372
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:02,479
neat way to write it but this is also
 

373
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:03,430
neat way to write it but this is also
does the same thing

381
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,430
answered yes it's all one none okay
okay so can we can we do it without the

382
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:15,440
okay so can we can we do it without the
 

383
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,550
okay so can we can we do it without the
notebook because no good for them

384
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:18,560
notebook because no good for them
 

385
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,390
notebook because no good for them
yeah fake people maybe not okay

386
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:22,400
yeah fake people maybe not okay
 

387
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,790
yeah fake people maybe not okay
look it might be thank you and square

388
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:24,800
look it might be thank you and square
 

389
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,990
look it might be thank you and square
where down blue forcing

390
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:26,000
where down blue forcing
 

391
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,150
where down blue forcing
in this case is one square okay so

392
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:30,160

 

393
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,550

look we are trading now we are treating

394
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:32,560
look we are trading now we are treating
 

395
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,509
look we are trading now we are treating
the space

396
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:33,519
the space
 

397
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,949
the space
that's okay we are treating the space

398
00:08:34,949 --> 00:08:34,959
that's okay we are treating the space
 

399
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:36,709
that's okay we are treating the space
with the time okay

400
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:36,719
with the time okay
 

401
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,350
with the time okay
okay we are treating space here we are

402
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:39,360
okay we are treating space here we are
 

403
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,630
okay we are treating space here we are
using the o and space

404
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:40,640
using the o and space
 

405
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,110
using the o and space
counter right yeah okay so how can we

406
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:43,120
counter right yeah okay so how can we
 

407
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,030
counter right yeah okay so how can we
improve first

408
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,040
improve first
 

409
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,150
improve first
how can we prove first we

410
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:48,160
how can we prove first we
 

411
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,829
how can we prove first we
iterate through each number right yes

412
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:51,839
iterate through each number right yes
 

413
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,630
iterate through each number right yes
you tell me how to improve false blue

414
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:54,640
you tell me how to improve false blue
 

415
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,710
you tell me how to improve false blue
false okay blue fox

416
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:56,720
false okay blue fox
 

417
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,430
false okay blue fox
num okay look

418
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:01,440
num okay look
 

419
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,670
num okay look
look let's let's do a answer equals

420
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:03,680
look let's let's do a answer equals
 

421
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,190
look let's let's do a answer equals
minus one okay let's suppose

422
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:05,200
minus one okay let's suppose
 

423
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,910
minus one okay let's suppose
this the initial initially we can't find

424
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:07,920
this the initial initially we can't find
 

425
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,430
this the initial initially we can't find
lucky number right

426
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:09,440
lucky number right
 

427
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,750
lucky number right
yeah okay so now we need to

428
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:13,760
yeah okay so now we need to
 

429
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,509
yeah okay so now we need to
four look for i in

430
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:17,519
four look for i in
 

431
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,829
four look for i in
num right we go through each number

432
00:09:19,829 --> 00:09:19,839
num right we go through each number
 

433
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,870
num right we go through each number
right all right but for each number

434
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:22,880
right all right but for each number
 

435
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,430
right all right but for each number
what we need to do we need to count it

436
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:25,440
what we need to do we need to count it
 

437
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,710
what we need to do we need to count it
how many times right

438
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:26,720
how many times right
 

439
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,910
how many times right
yeah so we can use this if

440
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:29,920
yeah so we can use this if
 

441
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,430
yeah so we can use this if
nums look every dot count

442
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:33,440
nums look every dot count
 

443
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,509
nums look every dot count
yeah that's a function called cow cow

444
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:35,519
yeah that's a function called cow cow
 

445
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,070
yeah that's a function called cow cow
what color i

446
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:38,080
what color i
 

447
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,790
what color i
if equals i right right all right

448
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:42,800
if equals i right right all right
 

449
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,269
if equals i right right all right
then i is a lucky number so what should

450
00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:45,279
then i is a lucky number so what should
 

451
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,710
then i is a lucky number so what should
we do with the i

452
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:46,720
we do with the i
 

453
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,430
we do with the i
put it in the answer there's no answer

454
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:49,440
put it in the answer there's no answer
 

455
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:49,990
put it in the answer there's no answer
is the value

456
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:50,000
is the value
 

457
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,990
is the value
we want to we we don't have a list now

458
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:52,000
we want to we we don't have a list now
 

459
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,910
we want to we we don't have a list now
we we well we need to you can put it in

460
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:53,920
we we well we need to you can put it in
 

461
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,470
we we well we need to you can put it in
at least

462
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:54,480
at least
 

463
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,790
at least
list right then it would be written

464
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:56,800
list right then it would be written
 

465
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,509
list right then it would be written
maximum i

466
00:09:57,509 --> 00:09:57,519
maximum i
 

467
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,990
maximum i
answer right if there's but we can do

468
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:00,000
answer right if there's but we can do
 

469
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,710
answer right if there's but we can do
this look

470
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:00,720
this look
 

471
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,590
this look
then we can say if i is bigger than

472
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:03,600
then we can say if i is bigger than
 

473
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:03,990
then we can say if i is bigger than
answer

474
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:04,000
answer
 

475
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,829
answer
right right answer equals i right

476
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:07,839
right right answer equals i right
 

477
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,910
right right answer equals i right
all right and i can just return answer

478
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:09,920
all right and i can just return answer
 

479
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,949
all right and i can just return answer
i'm right

480
00:10:10,949 --> 00:10:10,959
i'm right
 

481
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:15,430
i'm right
does it make sense does it make sense

482
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:15,440
does it make sense does it make sense
 

483
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,710
does it make sense does it make sense
all this one you can just do this answer

484
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:18,720
all this one you can just do this answer
 

485
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,750
all this one you can just do this answer
equals max answer

486
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:21,760
equals max answer
 

487
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,069
equals max answer
i doesn't make sense look we are

488
00:10:24,069 --> 00:10:24,079
i doesn't make sense look we are
 

489
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:25,990
i doesn't make sense look we are
iterating these numbers

490
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:26,000
iterating these numbers
 

491
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,069
iterating these numbers
each number we try each number and we

492
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:28,079
each number we try each number and we
 

493
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,590
each number we try each number and we
count how many

494
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:29,600
count how many
 

495
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,790
count how many
i mean count how many times it appears

496
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:32,800
i mean count how many times it appears
 

497
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,069
i mean count how many times it appears
in the list right

498
00:10:34,069 --> 00:10:34,079
in the list right
 

499
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,670
in the list right
if it appears in the same value of times

500
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:37,680
if it appears in the same value of times
 

501
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,069
if it appears in the same value of times
then this is a lucky number right and we

502
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:40,079
then this is a lucky number right and we
 

503
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,190
then this is a lucky number right and we
need to

504
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:41,200
need to
 

505
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,190
need to
compare the store the largest lucky

506
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:43,200
compare the store the largest lucky
 

507
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,470
compare the store the largest lucky
number right

508
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:44,480
number right
 

509
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,069
number right
what's the time complexity

510
00:10:48,069 --> 00:10:48,079

 

511
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,550

why is it one square brief was in the

512
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:50,560
why is it one square brief was in the
 

513
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,910
why is it one square brief was in the
excellent i went to go

514
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:51,920
excellent i went to go
 

515
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:57,030
excellent i went to go
oh well done look at this

516
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,040
oh well done look at this
 

517
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,990
oh well done look at this
we're done this is on but this count

518
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,000
we're done this is on but this count
 

519
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,630
we're done this is on but this count
look this

520
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:00,640
look this
 

521
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,269
look this
is calm counting this number in an array

522
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:03,279
is calm counting this number in an array
 

523
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:03,750
is calm counting this number in an array
takes

524
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:03,760
takes
 

525
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,230
takes
another n right yeah so this four and

526
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:06,240
another n right yeah so this four and
 

527
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,389
another n right yeah so this four and
inside it needs another four

528
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:08,399
inside it needs another four
 

529
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,750
inside it needs another four
that's all n squared what's the time

530
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:09,760
that's all n squared what's the time
 

531
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:27,430
that's all n squared what's the time
what's the space complexity

532
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:27,440

 

533
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,790

it's not let's face the

534
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:30,800
it's not let's face the
 

535
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,030
it's not let's face the
a1 you can create a variable it doesn't

536
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:33,040
a1 you can create a variable it doesn't
 

537
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,870
a1 you can create a variable it doesn't
matter

538
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:34,880
matter
 

539
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,790
matter
this is a one constant means that there

540
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:36,800
this is a one constant means that there
 

541
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,870
this is a one constant means that there
are constant number of the spaces

542
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:38,880
are constant number of the spaces
 

543
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,750
are constant number of the spaces
right because if the n numbers egg on

544
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:41,760
right because if the n numbers egg on
 

545
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,630
right because if the n numbers egg on
this chair

546
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:42,640
this chair
 

547
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,150
this chair
okay okay um yeah because if like

548
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:46,160
okay okay um yeah because if like
 

549
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,990
okay okay um yeah because if like
numbers they are abundant numbers we

550
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:48,000
numbers they are abundant numbers we
 

551
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,430
numbers they are abundant numbers we
still need to

552
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:49,440
still need to
 

553
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,150
still need to
use one variable right it doesn't change

554
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:52,160
use one variable right it doesn't change
 

555
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,190
use one variable right it doesn't change
right that's why

556
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:53,200
right that's why
 

557
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,990
right that's why
or one constant okay so what how can we

558
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:56,000
or one constant okay so what how can we
 

559
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,350
or one constant okay so what how can we
do better

560
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:57,360
do better
 

561
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,870
do better
how can we do better look how can we do

562
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:00,880
how can we do better look how can we do
 

563
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,670
how can we do better look how can we do
well

564
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:03,680

 

565
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,350

we can solve the numbers from the

yeah and y
 

571
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,790
yeah and y
and what we can solve the numbers from

00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:14,800
and what we can solve the numbers from
 

573
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,430
and what we can solve the numbers from
look if

574
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:15,440
look if
 

575
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,750
look if
three we can solve the number three two

576
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:17,760
three we can solve the number three two
 

577
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,790

00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:21,600
right we saw the number from largest one
 

581
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,550
right we saw the number from largest one
to smallest and we go through this

599
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,629
look
if these two two two they have two two

00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:44,639
if these two two two they have two two
 

601

try from the largest to smallest
right i will immediately return the one

608
00:12:52,949 --> 00:12:52,959
right i will immediately return the one
 

609
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,470
right i will immediately return the one
the first lucky number i'm right

610
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:54,480
the first lucky number i'm right
 

611
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,069
the first lucky number i'm right
yeah does it make sense i don't need to

612
00:12:56,069 --> 00:12:56,079
yeah does it make sense i don't need to
 

613
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,150
yeah does it make sense i don't need to
find the largest right

614

find the largest right
 

615
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,790
find the largest right
okay can you repeat okay then you find

616
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:00,800
okay can you repeat okay then you find
 

617
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:07,750
okay can you repeat okay then you find

because the first first lucky number
 

623
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,150
because the first first lucky number
five would be the largest right because

00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,269
right and then four numbers multiple
numbers yeah

670
00:14:17,269 --> 00:14:17,279
numbers yeah
 

671
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,750
numbers yeah
you see remember how we merge two sorted

672
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:19,760
you see remember how we merge two sorted
 

673
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,790
you see remember how we merge two sorted
list right

674
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:20,800
list right
 

675
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,110
list right
we we have two pointers going through

676
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:23,120
we we have two pointers going through
 

677
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,470
we we have two pointers going through
comparing each

678
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:24,480
comparing each
 

679
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,389
comparing each
yeah right okay after so and then we

680
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:28,399
yeah right okay after so and then we
 

681
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:29,509
yeah right okay after so and then we
have a

682
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:29,519
have a
 

683
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,629
have a
number of the let's call it straight

684
00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:32,639
number of the let's call it straight
 

685
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,310
number of the let's call it straight
you know what's trick the number of

686
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:34,320
you know what's trick the number of
 

687
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,590
you know what's trick the number of
counter for the current number yeah

688
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:35,600
counter for the current number yeah
 

689
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,470
counter for the current number yeah
straight

690
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:36,480
straight
 

691
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,829
straight
c equals zero and then four i

692
00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:39,839
c equals zero and then four i
 

693
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,189
c equals zero and then four i
in numbs because

694
00:14:43,189 --> 00:14:43,199
in numbs because
 

695
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,030
in numbs because
yeah look this thought is from the

696
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:45,040
yeah look this thought is from the
 

697
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,310
yeah look this thought is from the
smallest to the largest

698
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:46,320
smallest to the largest
 

699
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,910
smallest to the largest
so now i i need to add a keyword reverse

700
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:49,920
so now i i need to add a keyword reverse
 

701
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,550
so now i i need to add a keyword reverse
equals two right then you'll be from the

702
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:52,560
equals two right then you'll be from the
 

703
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,750
equals two right then you'll be from the
largest to smallest

704
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:53,760
largest to smallest
 

705
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,069
largest to smallest
all right yeah and the time complexity

706
00:14:56,069 --> 00:14:56,079
all right yeah and the time complexity
 

707
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:57,509
all right yeah and the time complexity
will be still the same okay

708
00:14:57,509 --> 00:14:57,519
will be still the same okay
 

709
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,150
will be still the same okay
for i in numbers then we i will see plus

710
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:00,160
for i in numbers then we i will see plus
 

711
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,509
for i in numbers then we i will see plus
equals one right

712
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:01,519
equals one right
 

713
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,030
equals one right
right yeah the current number and

714
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:05,040
right yeah the current number and
 

715
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,150
right yeah the current number and
if uh probably

716
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:08,160
if uh probably
 

717
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,470
if uh probably
probably i i i'm not going to the

718
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:10,480
probably i i i'm not going to the
 

719
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,310
probably i i i'm not going to the
numbers i will go into the range

720
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:12,320
numbers i will go into the range
 

721
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,430
numbers i will go into the range
range the indexes length

722
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:15,440
range the indexes length
 

723
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,550
range the indexes length
lumps okay because i need to use the

724
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:18,560
lumps okay because i need to use the
 

725
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,509
lumps okay because i need to use the
indexes

726
00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:19,519
indexes
 

727
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,910
indexes
if if one i if it's the last number

728
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:23,920
if if one i if it's the last number
 

729
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,310
if if one i if it's the last number
then minus one or

730
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:28,320
then minus one or
 

731
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,110
then minus one or
or what or if the grams

732
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:33,120
or what or if the grams
 

733
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,150
or what or if the grams
i not equals

734
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:36,160
i not equals
 

735
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,030
i not equals
next numbers okay if it's not equals the

736
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:39,040
next numbers okay if it's not equals the
 

737
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,150
next numbers okay if it's not equals the
next numbers

738
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:40,160
next numbers
 

739
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,350
next numbers
so what should we do if

740
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:43,360
so what should we do if
 

741
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,870
so what should we do if
we start in c equals

742
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:46,880
we start in c equals
 

743
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,150
we start in c equals
now if c equals num psi right this is a

744
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:50,160
now if c equals num psi right this is a
 

745
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,189
now if c equals num psi right this is a
lucky number right

746
00:15:51,189 --> 00:15:51,199
lucky number right
 

747
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,230
lucky number right
when we determine we right

748
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:54,240
when we determine we right
 

749
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,110
when we determine we right
otherwise look otherwise what otherwise

750
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:57,120
otherwise look otherwise what otherwise
 

751
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,870
otherwise look otherwise what otherwise
we need to set c equals zero and then we

752
00:15:58,870 --> 00:15:58,880
we need to set c equals zero and then we
 

753
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,389
we need to set c equals zero and then we
turn minus one doesn't make sense

754
00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:02,399
turn minus one doesn't make sense
 

755
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,110
turn minus one doesn't make sense
um take a minute to think about it and

756
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:05,120
um take a minute to think about it and
 

757
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:05,829
um take a minute to think about it and
i'm going to

758
00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:05,839
i'm going to
 

759
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,470
i'm going to
ask you questions okay why because i

760
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:08,480
ask you questions okay why because i
 

761
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,110
ask you questions okay why because i
need to

762
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:09,120
need to
 

763
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,150
need to
check if you understand why

764
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:12,160
check if you understand why
 

765
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,189
check if you understand why
stop saying that why why

766
00:16:15,189 --> 00:16:15,199
stop saying that why why
 

767
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:20,870
stop saying that why why
okay okay

768
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:20,880

 

769
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,150

okay look right what

770
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:24,160
okay look right what
 

771
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:29,509
okay look right what
so ryan ryan

772
00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:29,519

 

773
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,829

i i will go through the ranges each

774
00:16:31,829 --> 00:16:31,839
i i will go through the ranges each
 

775
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:32,949
i i will go through the ranges each
index right

776
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:32,959
index right
 

777
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,790
index right
and then i will increment the current

778
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:34,800
and then i will increment the current
 

779
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,990
and then i will increment the current
number counter

780
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:36,000
number counter
 

781
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,710
number counter
strike c will be equals one and if it's

782
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:38,720
strike c will be equals one and if it's
 

783
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,350
strike c will be equals one and if it's
look if

784
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:39,360
look if
 

785
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,870
look if
it doesn't go inside it means the

786
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:40,880
it doesn't go inside it means the
 

787
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,870
it doesn't go inside it means the
current number is equals to the next

788
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:42,880
current number is equals to the next
 

789
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,990
current number is equals to the next
number right

790
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:44,000
number right
 

791
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,470
number right
right and then next iteration c will be

792
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:46,480
right and then next iteration c will be
 

793
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,910
right and then next iteration c will be
equals two right

794
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:47,920
equals two right
 

795
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,389
equals two right
and i know look if it's the last number

796
00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:50,399
and i know look if it's the last number
 

797
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:51,110
and i know look if it's the last number
or

798
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:51,120
or
 

799
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,790
or
if it's not equals to the next number

800
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:52,800
if it's not equals to the next number
 

801
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,949
if it's not equals to the next number
what does it mean if it's not equal to

802
00:16:54,949 --> 00:16:54,959
what does it mean if it's not equal to
 

803
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:55,749
what does it mean if it's not equal to
the next number

804
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:55,759
the next number
 

805
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,269
the next number
then it means that the current number

806
00:16:59,269 --> 00:16:59,279
then it means that the current number
 

807
00:16:59,279 --> 00:16:59,910
then it means that the current number
appears

808
00:16:59,910 --> 00:16:59,920
appears
 

809
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,430
appears
c times right and what's this if c

810
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:03,440
c times right and what's this if c
 

811
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,309
c times right and what's this if c
equals

812
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:04,319
equals
 

813
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,789
equals
i what does it mean c

814
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:08,799

 

815
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,549

it means that uh lucky number well

816
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:12,559
it means that uh lucky number well
 

817
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,069
it means that uh lucky number well
i will return the first lucky number

818
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:14,079
i will return the first lucky number
 

819
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,069
i will return the first lucky number
right yeah yeah and if it's not a lucky

820
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:16,079
right yeah yeah and if it's not a lucky
 

821
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,909
right yeah yeah and if it's not a lucky
number what should i do i should reset

822
00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:17,919
number what should i do i should reset
 

823
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:20,150
number what should i do i should reset
the

824
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:20,160
the
 

825
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,630
the
check so the next iteration you'll be

826
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:22,640
check so the next iteration you'll be
 

827
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,230
check so the next iteration you'll be
appearing one time up right

828
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:24,240
appearing one time up right
 

829
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,990
appearing one time up right
okay two times appears to design does it

830
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:26,000
okay two times appears to design does it
 

831
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,190
okay two times appears to design does it
make sense what's the term complexity

832
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:29,200
make sense what's the term complexity
 

833
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,070
make sense what's the term complexity
log n okay is that a separate sentence

834
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:34,080
log n okay is that a separate sentence
 

835
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,230
log n okay is that a separate sentence
again oh and again this one is a one

836
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:36,240
again oh and again this one is a one
 

837
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,750
again oh and again this one is a one
right a bracket

838
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:37,760
right a bracket
 

839
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,870
right a bracket
and l o g and bracket okay

840
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:40,880
and l o g and bracket okay
 

841
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,470
and l o g and bracket okay
so look this angle is consists of two

842
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:44,480
so look this angle is consists of two
 

843
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,029
so look this angle is consists of two
parts

844
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:45,039
parts
 

845
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,390
parts
the salting the saltine and this our

846
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:48,400
the salting the saltine and this our
 

847
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,029
the salting the saltine and this our
part

848
00:17:49,029 --> 00:17:49,039
part
 

849
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:55,350
part
which is dominating which is bigger

850
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:55,360

 

851
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,270

this one yeah oh and nothing because

852
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:57,280
this one yeah oh and nothing because
 

853
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,430
this one yeah oh and nothing because
it's time again yeah logan could be

854
00:17:59,430 --> 00:17:59,440
it's time again yeah logan could be
 

855
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,029
it's time again yeah logan could be
bigger than one right

856
00:18:01,029 --> 00:18:01,039
bigger than one right
 

857
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,909
bigger than one right
yeah so this one is take is most time

858
00:18:03,909 --> 00:18:03,919
yeah so this one is take is most time
 

859
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,270
yeah so this one is take is most time
consuming part so we

860
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:05,280
consuming part so we
 

861
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,950
consuming part so we
when we talk about everything we pick

862
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:06,960
when we talk about everything we pick
 

863
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,390
when we talk about everything we pick
the most dominant ping pong which is

864
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:08,400
the most dominant ping pong which is
 

865
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:08,950
the most dominant ping pong which is
this one

866
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:08,960
this one
 

867
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,190
this one
yeah and you got that one yeah yeah okay

868
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:11,200
yeah and you got that one yeah yeah okay
 

869
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,230
yeah and you got that one yeah yeah okay
does it make sense yeah

870
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:12,240
does it make sense yeah
 

871
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,990
does it make sense yeah
okay and if if i tell you if the numbers

872
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:16,000
okay and if if i tell you if the numbers
 

873
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,830
okay and if if i tell you if the numbers
are already sorted

874
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:17,840
are already sorted
 

875
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,190
are already sorted
is like numbers

876
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:21,200

 

877
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,029

yes and what's the time complexity

878
00:18:25,029 --> 00:18:25,039
yes and what's the time complexity
 

879
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,789
yes and what's the time complexity
yeah oh and you're just in the race list

880
00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:28,799
yeah oh and you're just in the race list
 

881
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,669
yeah oh and you're just in the race list
okay stop checking okay okay i'm going

882
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:31,679
okay stop checking okay okay i'm going
 

883
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,110
okay stop checking okay okay i'm going
to erase this okay so

884
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:33,120
to erase this okay so
 

885
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,870
to erase this okay so
what should i put here yeah
