okay
[Music]

16
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:23,920

 

17
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,670

you know what's magic oh yeah you taught

18
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:25,680
you know what's magic oh yeah you taught
 

19
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,870
you know what's magic oh yeah you taught
us before so what's magic

20
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:28,880
us before so what's magic
 

21
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,390
us before so what's magic
are you doing the maid thingy or

22
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:30,400
are you doing the maid thingy or
 

23
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,430
are you doing the maid thingy or
something yeah magic yeah

24
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:33,440
something yeah magic yeah
 

25
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,870
something yeah magic yeah
magic like on my bed so this magic

26
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:36,880
magic like on my bed so this magic
 

27
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,709
magic like on my bed so this magic
is like a two-dimensional list rows

28
00:00:40,709 --> 00:00:40,719
is like a two-dimensional list rows
 

29
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,709
is like a two-dimensional list rows
columns yeah and we are given the binary

30
00:00:44,709 --> 00:00:44,719
columns yeah and we are given the binary
 

31
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:45,910
columns yeah and we are given the binary
matrix

32
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:45,920
matrix
 

33
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,510
matrix
okay can i have your attention please

34
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:47,520
okay can i have your attention please
 

35
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,750
okay can i have your attention please
the final metric so what's fine

36
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:51,760

 

37
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,990

two so meaning that the magic can have

38
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:54,000
two so meaning that the magic can have
 

39
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,470
two so meaning that the magic can have
contains the elements zero and one

40
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:56,480
contains the elements zero and one
 

41
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,510
contains the elements zero and one
okay yeah unless one more thing for this

42
00:00:59,510 --> 00:00:59,520
okay yeah unless one more thing for this
 

43
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,150
okay yeah unless one more thing for this
binary

44
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:00,160
binary
 

45
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,830
binary
metric particular is that each row

46
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:03,840
metric particular is that each row
 

47
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,109
metric particular is that each row
the zeros okay sorry like yellows always

48
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:07,119
the zeros okay sorry like yellows always
 

49
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:08,230
the zeros okay sorry like yellows always
come before the

50
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:08,240
come before the
 

51
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,710
come before the
ones so zero zero one one so it's sorted

52
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:10,720
ones so zero zero one one so it's sorted
 

53
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,270
ones so zero zero one one so it's sorted
yeah

54
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:11,280
yeah
 

55
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,870
yeah
okay okay yeah doesn't make sense

56
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:14,880
okay okay yeah doesn't make sense
 

57
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,749
okay okay yeah doesn't make sense
we have to return if it's true we want

58
00:01:17,749 --> 00:01:17,759
we have to return if it's true we want
 

59
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:18,789
we have to return if it's true we want
to find out the

60
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:18,799
to find out the
 

61
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,350
to find out the
left most leftmost

62
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:23,360
left most leftmost
 

63
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,749
left most leftmost
column that contains the one so in this

64
00:01:25,749 --> 00:01:25,759
column that contains the one so in this
 

65
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:26,390
column that contains the one so in this
case this

66
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:26,400
case this
 

67
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,590
case this
corner contains one so you return

68
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:29,600
corner contains one so you return
 

69
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,870
corner contains one so you return
one okay okay doesn't make sense

70
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:34,880
one okay okay doesn't make sense
 

71
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,630
one okay okay doesn't make sense
do you understand this problem so let's

72
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:38,640
do you understand this problem so let's
 

73
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,749
do you understand this problem so let's
see how do you return see what if there

74
00:01:41,749 --> 00:01:41,759
see how do you return see what if there
 

75
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,030
see how do you return see what if there
isn't any

76
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,040
isn't any
 

77
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,429
isn't any
even like a good question if there's any

78
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:45,439
even like a good question if there's any
 

79
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,149
even like a good question if there's any
even all

80
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:46,159
even all
 

81
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,830
even all
zero yeah yeah return minus one okay

82
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:49,840
zero yeah yeah return minus one okay
 

83
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,590
zero yeah yeah return minus one okay
if they're all zero you can't find the

84
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:51,600
if they're all zero you can't find the
 

85
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,190
if they're all zero you can't find the
one there's no

86
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:53,200
one there's no
 

87
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,350
one there's no
such thing as leftmost one and this

88
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:55,360
such thing as leftmost one and this
 

89
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,870
such thing as leftmost one and this
isn't mine why do you return

90
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:56,880
isn't mine why do you return
 

91
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,069
isn't mine why do you return
one one because look that's yellow

92
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:00,079
one one because look that's yellow
 

93
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,310
one one because look that's yellow
column column zero column one has the

94
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:02,320
column column zero column one has the
 

95
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,429
column column zero column one has the
one okay

96
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:03,439
one okay
 

97
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,990
one okay
got it so how can we solve this problem

98
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:08,000
got it so how can we solve this problem
 

99
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,270
got it so how can we solve this problem
the

100
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:11,280

 

101
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:18,150

yeah how can we solve this

102
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:18,160

 

103
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,990

what kind of ideas have come to your

104
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:20,000
what kind of ideas have come to your
 

105
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,869
what kind of ideas have come to your
mind yeah

106
00:02:24,869 --> 00:02:24,879

 

107
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,589

no we're done so we we kind of get this

108
00:02:27,589 --> 00:02:27,599
no we're done so we we kind of get this
 

109
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,470
no we're done so we we kind of get this
the

110
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:28,480
the
 

111
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,710
the
before thing right yeah because why

112
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:30,720
before thing right yeah because why
 

113
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,710
before thing right yeah because why
can't we do this because

114
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:32,720
can't we do this because
 

115
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,949
can't we do this because
we can do this again scan from the left

116
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:34,959
we can do this again scan from the left
 

117
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:35,990
we can do this again scan from the left
to the right right

118
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:36,000
to the right right
 

119
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,309
to the right right
because we all know that the zeros comes

120
00:02:38,309 --> 00:02:38,319
because we all know that the zeros comes
 

121
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,350
because we all know that the zeros comes
before the one

122
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:39,360
before the one
 

123
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,869
before the one
right all right so we can do this

124
00:02:42,869 --> 00:02:42,879
right all right so we can do this
 

125
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,790
right all right so we can do this
right what's the term complexity for

126
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:44,800
right what's the term complexity for
 

127
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,949
right what's the term complexity for
this one if we do this

128
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:46,959
this one if we do this
 

129
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,390
this one if we do this
if there are r columns and c are all c

130
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:50,400
if there are r columns and c are all c
 

131
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,670
if there are r columns and c are all c
columns c sorry c

132
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:53,680
columns c sorry c
 

133
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,150
columns c sorry c
why is this thing they are times c r c

134
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:56,160
why is this thing they are times c r c
 

135
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:56,869
why is this thing they are times c r c
yes because

136
00:02:56,869 --> 00:02:56,879
yes because
 

137
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,750
yes because
in the worst case it's all zeros you

138
00:02:59,750 --> 00:02:59,760
in the worst case it's all zeros you
 

139
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,670
in the worst case it's all zeros you
have to scan of it right

140
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:01,680
have to scan of it right
 

141
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,869
have to scan of it right
yeah yeah okay so let's the best case

142
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:04,879
yeah yeah okay so let's the best case
 

143
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,309
yeah yeah okay so let's the best case
is this one yeah look alright

144
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:08,319
is this one yeah look alright
 

145
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:13,670
is this one yeah look alright
so look so for

146
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:13,680

 

147
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:29,589

column in range

148
00:03:29,589 --> 00:03:29,599

no we want to return the column so which

162
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:51,040
no we want to return the column so which
 

163
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,789
no we want to return the column so which
one is the column

164
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:52,799
one is the column
 

165
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,190
one is the column
c yeah that's it otherwise with 10 minus

166

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,750
all right all rc okay
we're done so can we do better

172
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:03,760
we're done so can we do better
 

173
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,670
we're done so can we do better
maybe we can wait that this need is fine

174
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:07,680
maybe we can wait that this need is fine
 

175
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,229
maybe we can wait that this need is fine
yeah of course yeah of course he needs

176
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:10,239
yeah of course yeah of course he needs
 

177
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,149
yeah of course yeah of course he needs
to be in different but i'm just writing

178
00:04:12,149 --> 00:04:12,159
to be in different but i'm just writing
 

179
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,030
to be in different but i'm just writing
just to illustrate this idea how to

180
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:15,040
just to illustrate this idea how to
 

181
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,710
just to illustrate this idea how to
solve this you know i say well done this

182
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:16,720
solve this you know i say well done this
 

183
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,310
solve this you know i say well done this
is professing yeah we're checking that

184
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:18,320
is professing yeah we're checking that
 

185
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,110
is professing yeah we're checking that
out so how can i do

186
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:23,120
out so how can i do
 

187
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,710
out so how can i do
how can we do better okay how about if i

188
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:26,720
how can we do better okay how about if i
 

189
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,110
how can we do better okay how about if i
tell you remember previously if we have

190
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:29,120
tell you remember previously if we have
 

191
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,310
tell you remember previously if we have
uh

192
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:30,320
uh
 

193
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,510
uh
we want to find eric previously

194
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:33,520
we want to find eric previously
 

195
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,469
we want to find eric previously
something like that the rows are sorted

196
00:04:36,469 --> 00:04:36,479
something like that the rows are sorted
 

197
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,909
something like that the rows are sorted
the columns are thought if you want to

198
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:37,919
the columns are thought if you want to
 

199
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:38,710
the columns are thought if you want to
find the number

200
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:38,720
find the number
 

201
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,590
find the number
in in the metric right we can start with

202
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:41,600
in in the metric right we can start with
 

203
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,230
in in the metric right we can start with
the right

204
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:42,240
the right
 

205
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,950
the right
top right corner right if it's smaller

206
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:44,960
top right corner right if it's smaller
 

207
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,950
top right corner right if it's smaller
we go down if it's bigger we go left

208
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:46,960
we go down if it's bigger we go left
 

209
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,830
we go down if it's bigger we go left
right

210
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:47,840
right
 

211
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,030
right
all right yeah

212
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:51,040
all right yeah
 

213
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,070
all right yeah
so look look

214
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:54,080
so look look
 

215
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,070
so look look
previously we have this yellow one two

216
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:56,080
previously we have this yellow one two
 

217
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,510
previously we have this yellow one two
three and then

218
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:57,520
three and then
 

219
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,749
three and then
and then four or five and then this

220
00:04:59,749 --> 00:04:59,759
and then four or five and then this
 

221
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,110
and then four or five and then this
maybe

222
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:01,120
maybe
 

223
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,590
maybe
three two one okay something like that

224
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:03,600
three two one okay something like that
 

225
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,590
three two one okay something like that
if we want to find out

226
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:05,600
if we want to find out
 

227
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,909
if we want to find out
the let's say that we only find a

228
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:09,919
the let's say that we only find a
 

229
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,430
the let's say that we only find a
six maybe maybe four uh

230
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:13,440
six maybe maybe four uh
 

231
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,390
six maybe maybe four uh
maybe maybe let's say this is six here

232
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:16,400
maybe maybe let's say this is six here
 

233
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,189
maybe maybe let's say this is six here
right

234
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:17,199
right
 

235
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,189
right
and that's the if we want to find out

236
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:19,199
and that's the if we want to find out
 

237
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,029
and that's the if we want to find out
the six we start here

238
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:21,039
the six we start here
 

239
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,390
the six we start here
it's a bigger one it's bigger than three

240
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:24,400
it's a bigger one it's bigger than three
 

241
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,790
it's a bigger one it's bigger than three
go down you're bigger than remember if

242
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:26,800
go down you're bigger than remember if
 

243
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,590
go down you're bigger than remember if
it's smaller

244
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:27,600
it's smaller
 

245
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,710
it's smaller
go left right remember the thing is

246
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:30,720
go left right remember the thing is
 

247
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,310
go left right remember the thing is
the search a target in the binary

248
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:34,320
the search a target in the binary
 

249
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,110
the search a target in the binary
mat uh in in the sorted matrix right we

250
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:37,120
mat uh in in the sorted matrix right we
 

251
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,629
mat uh in in the sorted matrix right we
talked about this before

252
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:38,639
talked about this before
 

253
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,350
talked about this before
right so because this is sorted and this

254
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:41,360
right so because this is sorted and this
 

255
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,469
right so because this is sorted and this
is sorted

256
00:05:42,469 --> 00:05:42,479
is sorted
 

257
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,870
is sorted
yeah so look if we were supposed to be

258
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:44,880
yeah so look if we were supposed to be
 

259
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,510
yeah so look if we were supposed to be
here

260
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:45,520
here
 

261
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,150
here
sorry i think four's supposed to be here

262
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:48,160
sorry i think four's supposed to be here
 

263
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,029
sorry i think four's supposed to be here
right

264
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:49,039
right
 

265
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,230
right
uh yeah kind of kind of look if if this

266
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:52,240
uh yeah kind of kind of look if if this
 

267
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,430
uh yeah kind of kind of look if if this
is this what zero one two three and then

268
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:55,440
is this what zero one two three and then
 

269
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,510
is this what zero one two three and then
three one two zero if you want to find

270
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:57,520
three one two zero if you want to find
 

271
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,550
three one two zero if you want to find
the six

272
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:58,560
the six
 

273
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,230
the six
yeah if we want to find six it's bigger

274
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:02,240
yeah if we want to find six it's bigger
 

275
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,430
yeah if we want to find six it's bigger
then we go down right

276
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:03,440
then we go down right
 

277
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,029
then we go down right
if we want to find two it's smaller we

278
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:05,039
if we want to find two it's smaller we
 

279
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,189
if we want to find two it's smaller we
go left right yeah so let's

280
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:07,199
go left right yeah so let's
 

281
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,110
go left right yeah so let's
think if this is one

282
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:11,120
think if this is one
 

283
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,270
think if this is one
if this is one do we need to go down

284
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:15,280
if this is one do we need to go down
 

285
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,270
if this is one do we need to go down
oh we need to go left that's right

286
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:17,280
oh we need to go left that's right
 

287
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,790
oh we need to go left that's right
because the already is one we need to

288
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:18,800
because the already is one we need to
 

289
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,590
because the already is one we need to
check left yeah if it's zero

290
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:21,600
check left yeah if it's zero
 

291
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,830
check left yeah if it's zero
we need to go down right yeah because

292
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:23,840
we need to go down right yeah because
 

293
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,029
we need to go down right yeah because
zero we're not sure right

294
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:25,039
zero we're not sure right
 

295
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,950
zero we're not sure right
all right and if we go down to the

296
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:26,960
all right and if we go down to the
 

297
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,629
all right and if we go down to the
bottom you go to the next one

298
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:28,639
bottom you go to the next one
 

299
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,430
bottom you go to the next one
if it's zero we go down let's see

300
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:31,440
if it's zero we go down let's see
 

301
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,430
if it's zero we go down let's see
because we can't find zero we cross the

302
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:33,440
because we can't find zero we cross the
 

303
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,590
because we can't find zero we cross the
boundary and let's say we can't find it

304
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:35,600
boundary and let's say we can't find it
 

305
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,670
boundary and let's say we can't find it
but we already update the answer right

306
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:37,680
but we already update the answer right
 

307
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,870
but we already update the answer right
so if it's one we go left we update the

308
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:40,880
so if it's one we go left we update the
 

309
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,189
so if it's one we go left we update the
answer because we already know the

310
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:43,199
answer because we already know the
 

311
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,510
answer because we already know the
the worst case is this one right we

312
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:45,520
the worst case is this one right we
 

313
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,390
the worst case is this one right we
already know there's

314
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:46,400
already know there's
 

315
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,950
already know there's
one as here right we need to find if

316
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:48,960
one as here right we need to find if
 

317
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,830
one as here right we need to find if
they are less

318
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:49,840
they are less
 

319
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,029
they are less
they are ones and here right

320
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:53,039
they are ones and here right
 

321
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,550
they are ones and here right
yeah okay so

322
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:56,560
yeah okay so
 

323
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,710
yeah okay so
so let's say answer at the beginning

324
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:58,720
so let's say answer at the beginning
 

325
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,710
so let's say answer at the beginning
equals minus minus one we assume it's

326
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:00,720
equals minus minus one we assume it's
 

327
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,309
equals minus minus one we assume it's
not there right okay

328
00:07:02,309 --> 00:07:02,319
not there right okay
 

329
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,230
not there right okay
and let's ah let's see yeah then at the

330
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:04,240
and let's ah let's see yeah then at the
 

331
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,749
and let's ah let's see yeah then at the

all right all right what if
there was this zero and the zero this

360
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:55,919
there was this zero and the zero this
 

361
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,469
there was this zero and the zero this
day with one hand one hand

362

day with one hand one hand
 

363
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,230
day with one hand one hand
that's okay if it's one here you wanna

00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:00,240
that's okay if it's one here you wanna
 

365
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,510
that's okay if it's one here you wanna
that's okay

366

00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:09,680
yeah yeah here yeah go down yeah
 

371
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,790
yeah yeah here yeah go down yeah
go left yeah go down yeah

372
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:12,800
go left yeah go down yeah
 

373
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,150
go left yeah go down yeah
i know what here what go left

374
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:16,160
i know what here what go left
 

375
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,189
i know what here what go left
automatic so we finally got it

376
00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:19,199
automatic so we finally got it
 

377
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,150
automatic so we finally got it
so look why because it can go only go

378
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:22,160
so look why because it can go only go
 

379
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,629
so look why because it can go only go
left

00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:29,840
real and c needs to be bigger than zero
 

387
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,629
real and c needs to be bigger than zero
