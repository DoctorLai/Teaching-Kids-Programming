1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,799
okay

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:10,160
so we talked about the minimum spanning

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:12,960
tree yesterday and then the agreement we

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,719
uh we teaching is what

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,720
what what can i what what's the name of

6
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,320
the acura we talk about crosstalk

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,800
because okay

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,359
yeah okay

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,199
so okay so meaning expanding three okay

10
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,359
so let's review a little bit okay let's

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,530
review a little bit

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:33,619
so we have lisa

13
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,619
[Music]

14
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:45,039
[Music]

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,000
that looks like a diamond or something

16
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,280
yeah yeah yeah so one two five

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,760
four so

18
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,320
wait so what are we doing uh so we have

19
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,719
a four uh four vertex and then how many

20
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:00,239
edges we need to bear to for this

21
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:02,320
minimum spending trees so one two five

22
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,080
so how many edges

23
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,799
so far

24
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,040
one two four two one four okay two one

25
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:13,520
four two one four

26
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,640
two one is two one point two one four

27
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,680
so let us

28
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,600
so first of all we pick we have all the

29
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,240
vertices which is has

30
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,280
uh n doesn't matter

31
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,280
[Music]

32
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,560
what doesn't matter about the order you

33
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,240
say in

34
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,479
what do you mean like

35
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,720
like that is two one four so can you say

36
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,000
one two four it's okay it's okay but

37
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,640
first of all

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,640
first of all look we have n vertex four

39
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,119
vertices so we have uh we need to build

40
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,479
a minimum spanning tree with the four

41
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:46,320
trees yeah each one we separate uh no

42
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,399
edges just verticals and then we start

43
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,720
picking the edges that does not form the

44
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,560
cycle so the first one we notice in peak

45
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,600
is one and then the second one will pick

46
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,920
up two

47
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,840
and then now look three three because it

48
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,759
has form a cycle so that's why we don't

49
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,119
pick it i will skip it so the next one

50
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,439
is four right

51
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,479
yeah easy peasy so this is the minimum

52
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,439
expense

53
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:09,599
okay so that's a question with n vertex

54
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,080
uh what's the n minus one

55
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,360
okay n minus one yes and minus one edges

56
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,000
okay

57
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,560
okay so this one is that we start by

58
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,560
adding the edges right look we we have

59
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,680
this vertex and we start by adding the

60
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,920
edges

61
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,680
okay adding my edges

62
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,920
so the time connection as we talked

63
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,000
about we need to solve these edges by

64
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,239
the ascending order of the weight right

65
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,959
so we this is e

66
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,200
o

67
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,480
e log e right remember

68
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,720
the edges

69
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,560
let's just say both the time complexion

70
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,480
yeah the term complexity okay you can

71
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,480
just say what's the sound complexity

72
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,319
instead of just telling us

73
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,200
oh you want me to ask you the questions

74
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,720
okay

75
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,560
okay so what's the

76
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,239
because we are using what kind of data

77
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,000
structure will you need

78
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,400
no no with all kind of data structure

79
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,280
data structure you use to this joint set

80
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,720
this is john cena yeah okay

81
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,239
okay

82
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,410
this question especially for you yeah

83
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,620
because you answered

84
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:07,620
[Music]

85
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,879
and how many edges are there and minus

86
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:24,400
one no no i mean the maximum like for

87
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,599
example like if there are four

88
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,840
look

89
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,239
there's a cycle though yeah yeah i mean

90
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,879
the graph okay i like the graph if it's

91
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,159
the graph if there's a graph okay if

92
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,200
there's a graph

93
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,920
with n

94
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:41,120
m vertex yeah and vertex

95
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,680
and how many maximum number of edges can

96
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,959
you think about

97
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,280
think about it look it could be crossed

98
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:53,760
how many of these look

99
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:56,159
lots yeah i know infinity

100
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,959
how is that infinity look for each one

101
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:01,040
you have the edges to n minus one right

102
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,599
so for each one you have the edges to m

103
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,000
minus n times three

104
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,840
now look at four this is how is that n

105
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,720
times two look at these three edges how

106
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,640
many of them are three

107
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,519
so three edges that's the

108
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,359
next one two plus one right so it's n

109
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,880
minus one plus

110
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:23,759
n minus two plus tier one right so for

111
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,240
example n edges uh and vertex i the

112
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,880
first the first vertex has connections

113
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,759
to the n minus one right so it's n minus

114
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,400
one so for the second one

115
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,880
it has the edges to

116
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,199
n minus two right so you probably plus

117
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,880
one right okay so that's the total

118
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,160
number of edges

119
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,080
okay so it's in a scale of uh n

120
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,840
square right it's in the scale it's not

121
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,120
exactly the same

122
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,280
you get it

123
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,280
so

124
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,160
well why this is not working okay

125
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,199
because you missed the part which is

126
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,199
stuck to the board

127
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,680
so okay so

128
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,080
maybe okay so

129
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,840
what i'm trying to say here is this

130
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:13,120
you've got this dumb thing

131
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,120
yeah that's okay there we go

132
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,919
okay

133
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,400
let's

134
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,479
need to put numbers though no no i don't

135
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,400
for example this one let's consider the

136
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,360
first vertex right

137
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,479
this is

138
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,680
vertex so you can have the edges to

139
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,320
how many

140
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:35,680
how many vertices are five yeah but if

141
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:39,840
this is the n there are n vertices

142
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,840
and minus one okay so n minus

143
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,720
no no no

144
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,759
no no no okay next one because i'm

145
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,560
trying to

146
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,639
you can okay

147
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:54,240
when i said the questions then you it

148
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:57,280
answered okay so now so for the second

149
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,199
one how many edges you can have two

150
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,560
a minus one but we already count this so

151
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,600
we don't count it again yeah it's

152
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,840
literally set anymore n minus one

153
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,639
and one is one

154
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,319
minus two yeah and then the next one and

155
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,319
one is three

156
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:15,039
yeah and my why is that minus three

157
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:17,440
because it has two and one is three

158
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:20,639
how many

159
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:23,120
no look at you because i already have

160
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,039
two so you can't count these these right

161
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,360
so it's n minus three yeah

162
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:30,639
and minus one minus two okay so

163
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,960
i said n minus three okay and then after

164
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:36,319
a minus four yeah after one right so

165
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:38,880
what's this what's this sum n square

166
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:42,160
uh i don't know yet look so the first

167
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,960
first item is uh the sum will be n minus

168
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:48,000
one plus one how many items are there

169
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,720
times n minus one divided by two y yeah

170
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,680
so this is this is the equation to sum

171
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,360
the

172
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,759
uh

173
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,039
the you know aromatic

174
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,880
sequence right

175
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:03,759
so 1 plus 2 plus 3 plus 2 n minus 1 the

176
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:06,400
first item the last item how many items

177
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,960
online divided by two so it's n times n

178
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,120
minus one divided by two right so this

179
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,919
this is the number this is the possible

180
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,639
number of edges for a graph with n

181
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:19,759
vertex okay so because we because we

182
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:23,440
know this o e log e right

183
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:26,080
yeah and if this e edges is the v square

184
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,560
right because look this is a v square

185
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:32,560
so if we say o e

186
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,560
log v square okay

187
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,800
yeah

188
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,560
so look

189
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,240
this one we have say log a

190
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,199
log uh

191
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,240
a

192
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,919
a uh to the power b actually you can put

193
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,879
a b look look at this is magic you can

194
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,879
put a b to the before so it becomes b

195
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:54,080
times log a

196
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:56,800
okay so this is a logarithmic uh

197
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,120
transformation for example like

198
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,840
log

199
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,680
two to the base of a right a is two to

200
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,160
the power of three right two to the

201
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,520
power of three is a right so that equals

202
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,400
three times

203
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,639
log

204
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,960
two we're down three times left so e to

205
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,960
the seven

206
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,360
we can also say look we move it to

207
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,960
before

208
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,960
right so now we drop the constant

209
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:33,039
okay so now let's come into the today's

210
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,039
topic with more questions okay

211
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,240
today we're going to talk about

212
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:41,599
another aquarium to compute the minimum

213
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:44,320
spending tree which is called prince

214
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,320
prince okay

215
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,839
all right okay so the previous thing

216
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,240
the previous thing we picked up away we

217
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,399
picked the edges and we added to the

218
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,279
forest right and now this time we want

219
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,680
to

220
00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:00,160
what we want to pick the vertex instead

221
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,160
so for example like

222
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,600
okay so you

223
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,880
so let's see what we can get okay

224
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,680
c

225
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,440
b

226
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:15,600
maybe here

227
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:17,760
okay let's say one two three four five

228
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,760
so

229
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,880
one two three before we pick the

230
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,440
smallest but now this time it's

231
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:27,040
different we can pick first of all which

232
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:29,600
letter which vertex you're going to pick

233
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,240
no no it doesn't matter pick one abcd or

234
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,480
e

235
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,240
okay because because why is it doesn't

236
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,080
matter because eventually all these

237
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,360
vertex will be in the minimum spanning

238
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,519
tree right right it's connected right

239
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,080
so we just pick a

240
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,440
okay so from a how many edges how many

241
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,680
edges

242
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,760
to one and two okay so now

243
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,480
now this is easy it's on board now we

244
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,320
can we have one it's not on a board okay

245
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,200
so then we pick the smallest one which

246
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,680
is

247
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,680
a to b

248
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,959
this is one okay

249
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,519
now

250
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:08,079
we have these yeah we have these three

251
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:10,079
now a or b how many veggies connect to a

252
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,519
now i have i have this one yeah i have

253
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,920
two this one

254
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:17,240
and how many edges you connect to the b

255
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,240
how many edges

256
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,800
so look i have one ap right so there are

257
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,519
two two out of it so first of all i pick

258
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,200
this one right pick a and then

259
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,120
there are two edges one and two because

260
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,000
i pick the smallest one so which is one

261
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,120
okay

262
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,839
so now i already have these yeah so how

263
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,880
many edges connected to these these one

264
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,839
right

265
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,880
this one and this one and this one yeah

266
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,720
right

267
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,560
so i pick the smallest which is two

268
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,880
right two three four i picked

269
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,000
the smallest one so i took this which is

270
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,800
d

271
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,839
two i yeah

272
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,839
then i

273
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,920
then that's the

274
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,839
the three i have built for now is this

275
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:05,200
included right

276
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:08,640
so now how many edges connected to

277
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,640
these a b or d

278
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,839
three

279
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,480
so no no i already know i already know

280
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,880
the tree minimum staining tree has abc

281
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,920
and how many edges which we haven't

282
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,200
added

283
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,800
connects to that vertex here one

284
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:29,399
what was one c

285
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,399
c c and then okay how many edges

286
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,800
okay how many one

287
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,000
what one how many vertex one how many

288
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,600
edges

289
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,240
two

290
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,560
so we pick four or five four four so we

291
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,320
pick four

292
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,800
uh four let's

293
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,360
uh let's see do you get it do you

294
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:54,160
understand this process so first of all

295
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,880
we randomly pick okay so the step one we

296
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,600
pick a vertex it doesn't have to it it's

297
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:02,399
it could be random pick the vertex

298
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,399
pick a vertex

299
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,680
v-e-r-t-x pick a vertex

300
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,639
and then

301
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,959
we we we need to separate these two uh

302
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,959
to this uh pick a vertex we want to put

303
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,160
it in these three i pick vertex and put

304
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,160
it in a tree

305
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,920
and then we have s equals all the

306
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,720
vertices

307
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,639
all the vertex and then we need to find

308
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:28,480
a vert a vertex

309
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:32,639
okay we need to find the vertex in s

310
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:35,200
right connecting to the existing tree

311
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,440
with the minimum edges edges

312
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,880
right so what i will try what are we

313
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,200
doing here look

314
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,360
uh

315
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:47,120
so if we have ap

316
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:49,360
right then then h is connected to a or b

317
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,440
is this a d

318
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,800
b d or b c

319
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,279
and then we just need to pick the

320
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,519
smallest of them and then try to and

321
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:59,839
then try to include these new

322
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,920
vertex new edges

323
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:06,240
in the tree make sense

324
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:09,880
okay let me write the step okay

325
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,880
let me know the steps

326
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,279
okay so now the first one we want to

327
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,440
field is that t will be equals to the

328
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,600
empty set right empty set

329
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,360
empty set this is the tree we are going

330
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,680
to

331
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,519
build define

332
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,480
prince

333
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:41,440
we have we have a graph right

334
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:44,560
so first of all we have a t equals m t

335
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:47,440
right and then no no no no

336
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,560
so we want to fill the vertex which is

337
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,800
vertical

338
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,160
let's say the vertex will be

339
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,199
e

340
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,920
and then

341
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,320
v

342
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,320
we will be let's say we start from the

343
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,480
beginning of the first node okay zero

344
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,480
okay

345
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,040
or

346
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,560
no no we don't need this why v in

347
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,199
different place what do you mean

348
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,199
different place

349
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,560
no no no this is the same i'm just

350
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,839
writing y v is not equal to

351
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,720
y v is not equal

352
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:32,560
to

353
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,760
right because we're going to

354
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,360
include

355
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,839
all the vertices anyway the minimum

356
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,839
spanning tree is is contains all the

357
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:42,000
vertex right all the vertex of the

358
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,680
original graph and it's connected right

359
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,920
because we're talking about a connective

360
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,720
it's just the edges is the

361
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,399
n minus one edges right right come on

362
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,560
see that

363
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:56,240
why v not equals the

364
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:58,639
uh gw why we haven't built enough vertex

365
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,959
we haven't included enough vertex in in

366
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,959
a minimum spanning tree now we need to

367
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:05,600
find the edges we need to find the

368
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:08,560
energy m n right the m and

369
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:11,279
m and n is the vertex number need to

370
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,839
find the edges five edges

371
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:15,920
find edges

372
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,920
okay so let's say we want to find what

373
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,760
we want to find the energy this this

374
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,079
function will return

375
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,639
the m

376
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:28,000
m it belongs to

377
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:29,279
belongs to existing v right existing v

378
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,120
and then

379
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,160
n belongs to

380
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,079
uh

381
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:39,360
g dot v minus m and minus v

382
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:41,680
this is look this is the vertex we have

383
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,600
included in a minimum spanning tree and

384
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,720
this is the vertex that we haven't

385
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,040
included

386
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:50,639
and we want to find out m n in these m

387
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:53,360
belongs to v and m belongs to v minus v

388
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,680
and also this edge is the smallest okay

389
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,279
and this is the smallest

390
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,600
smallest

391
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:02,639
and then after that then we can do what

392
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,639
we can include the graph t

393
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,399
equals t

394
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,880
including the graph right

395
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,240
with m to n

396
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,320
and then our v

397
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,839
will be equal to v

398
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:19,680
including the vertex vertex is

399
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,680
n right this is the the vertex

400
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,880
we want to include it right and a little

401
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,320
bit

402
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,720
a little bit

403
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:30,240
so the time complexity for this one okay

404
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:33,680
this is a bit tricky okay it is uh is o

405
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,040
uh e times the log e

406
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:39,360
log v

407
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,360
plus v times log of v okay

408
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,920
no no because we're going to use the

409
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,600
heap remember the heap

410
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,240
what's the hit by the way

411
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,959
anyone this is this first impression no

412
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,959
no no no no

413
00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:00,000
but not quite

414
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:03,120
the hip remember is the binary tree with

415
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,199
the top data structure data structure

416
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,199
okay so the third data structure

417
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,600
priority two yeah the one that you said

418
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,439
is prior to q so every time when you

419
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,400
take the element out it's always with

420
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:16,799
the priority right the smaller smallest

421
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,520
yeah with the smallest okay so then that

422
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:22,880
takes all because we have vert v vertex

423
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:25,760
so that requires log of v okay and we

424
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:28,319
need to traverse all the edges

425
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:31,440
but because because the verb look at the

426
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:34,480
vertex the vertical number is smaller

427
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,600
equal to the edge number right

428
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,880
am i right

429
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,880
don't write it on the floor come on

430
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,559
okay so the term convexity can also be o

431
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,360
e

432
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:47,840
log log of v because this one is trivial

433
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,000
right it's e plus v log v so it's

434
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,520
trivial

435
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,760
okay

436
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,760
uh

437
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,440
so

438
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,200
the space complexity is of v you know

439
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,320
because we need the data structure to

440
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,640
store

441
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,160
right we need to store these yeah we

442
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,480
need to store the

443
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,799
number of the

444
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:14,559
vertex

445
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:16,400
and okay so i'm going to write a

446
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,400
tree a graph

447
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,400
okay and then you tell me okay

448
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,640
you tell me how we how we're going to

449
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,039
build the minimum spanning tree using

450
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,520
this uh you know using this queen's

451
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,520
algorithm

452
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,640
but first of all let me give you a one

453
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,919
question what's the difference between

454
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:37,679
prince and crisco

455
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,679
they start from different places

456
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,679
you

457
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,400
what's the difference between couscous

458
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,160
and

459
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,240
prince

460
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:49,039
what are we doing in the couscous we

461
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:51,600
start adding what we start adding the

462
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,600
minimum

463
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,039
okay so

464
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,559
one

465
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,559
two

466
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,640
two three

467
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:15,360
four five six seven

468
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,360
okay so i'm

469
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,520
for the couscous we are picking the

470
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:24,320
smallest edges and add it to the forest

471
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:28,000
right we adding the edges but for the

472
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:29,039
prince prince we're adding the vertex

473
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
right

474
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,799
yeah makes sense

475
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,080
so

476
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:36,080
so okay so for now

477
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:43,360
you want to try with the prince again

478
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:47,039
how are we building this

479
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,799
that was two pokemon cards

480
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:51,960
you can work together let each one see

481
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,960
as well

482
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,600
remember what did i tell you about

483
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:00,000
randomly pick one pick one

484
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:02,880
okay so pick up a oh slowly yeah hey and

485
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,000
then okay so for me and then we move to

486
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,440
the smallest one okay one b okay here

487
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,440
okay

488
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,400
okay so now now what happened what's

489
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,000
next

490
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:16,240
you start from

491
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,240
how many edges connected to these

492
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:22,400
okay

493
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:24,320
yeah okay yeah that makes that's okay

494
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:28,919
yes okay and i know how many edges

495
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,919
connected to these and then

496
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:48,080
yeah so can you tell me how did you do

497
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:50,880
it come on i just need to explanation

498
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:53,840
because we we just we just looked at

499
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,159
people this morning

500
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,600
what does it connect to and we cloud it

501
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,799
yeah okay

502
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,559
okay so look you pick a then

503
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,480
how many edges connected

504
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,480
to one and three you pick one right yes

505
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,960
and now you have a b how many edges

506
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,760
connected to a and b

507
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,880
uh

508
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,200
one

509
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,400
how many edges this one this one this

510
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,080
one right

511
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,400
and i pick the smallest which is two

512
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,720
right how many edges connected to one a

513
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,720
b c

514
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,760
seven four

515
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,720
six yeah then i pick four right

516
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,039
all right

517
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,440
and how many edges

518
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,720
how many edges i pick uh

519
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,760
connects to

520
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,760
a b c d

521
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,640
a b c d so look so how how do you do

522
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,600
that

523
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,559
so how many h is connected to a b c d

524
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,120
you just

525
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:50,480
do this how many edges will be easier

526
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,200
huh

527
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,960
how many edges connected to abcd come on

528
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:58,400
how many edges left

529
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:00,000
one which one is that one two two yeah

530
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,919
come on five and six you pick up did you

531
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,880
get it yes

532
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:07,440
yeah yes i feel like

533
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,520
not quite not quite no no no okay so for

534
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,840
example how can i give you one two okay

535
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,840
okay

536
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:30,240
together

537
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:32,799
you did you decide we work together

538
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,799
you decide

539
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,480
okay

540
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,960
but you need to tell me exactly not not

541
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,840
just write it you need to tell me

542
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,280
okay

543
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,840
do you understand you need to tell me

544
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:46,000
you're still in the same way

545
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,159
yeah same way because i i'm

546
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,640
because you might think about you know

547
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:54,360
it's uh

548
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,360
it's different right

549
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,159
one two three

550
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,039
two

551
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,480
three

552
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,360
three

553
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,360
four

554
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,280
five

555
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,559
and then five

556
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:10,159
one

557
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:11,039
one okay come on that's it

558
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:14,159
okay

559
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:16,240
so first of all so we start with a

560
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,480
thumbs up

561
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,799
okay

562
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,960
yeah yeah yeah no no no you can't do all

563
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:24,960
that ask you need to tell me

564
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,760
how did you make the decision because

565
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:30,480
you because you got d because it has two

566
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,559
connections um

567
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,559
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah three or

568
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:37,440
two and two is the smallest no no

569
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:39,440
actually you can just mark it here okay

570
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,840
so it'll be easier okay that's why

571
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:44,640
you'll choose okay now you have all uh

572
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:47,919
how many vertices you've got

573
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,880
and how many vertices you got uh you got

574
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,919
one

575
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:54,799
two a and d okay and then what's next um

576
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:56,480
we choose we choose this

577
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:59,279
how many

578
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,960
how many because you have one two three

579
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:03,620
oh i haven't put it here

580
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,240
so okay so so what

581
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:08,799
[Music]

582
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,080
and now three four yeah okay and then we

583
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,799
will pick up

584
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,159
the smallest smallest yeah

585
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:16,159
okay we're done

586
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,880
and we're not definitely not going up so

587
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,480
our only choice is down the reason why

588
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,400
we're not going up because we don't want

589
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,080
cycling

590
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:27,120
okay so what's next what's next how many

591
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:29,440
edges can enter a b is three uh

592
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:31,679
this is this

593
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:34,559
and then g is and then you choose the

594
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:36,080
smallest one one okay maybe i put a four

595
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:39,440
here okay i do

596
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:41,440
okay okay okay and then

597
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,960
i'm thinking of way different and then

598
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,679
how many edges connects to these

599
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:48,320
please

600
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:50,080
yeah this yeah yeah yeah

601
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,080
and then this is

602
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:56,880
definitely the smallest okay okay and

603
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:58,480
then and then this is the yeah yeah

604
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,039
yeah and how many edges connected

605
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,720
because look you have a b d c there and

606
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:05,919
then you get to pick one of them it's

607
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:08,720
okay because they are all five

608
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,720
no no no

609
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,919
because this one is already included

610
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:15,120
right

611
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:17,600
don't get in yeah yeah

612
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,520
okay so to sum up you have uh these

613
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,760
three right because look what what have

614
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,440
you done so far is pick an a

615
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:28,640
and then you pick up

616
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:30,559
d you pick a b you pick a g you pick

617
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,559
uh e i don't know yeah

618
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:35,039
you start building the vertex

619
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:37,760
right you start building the vertex by

620
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:41,440
choosing the smallest edge

621
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:44,440
okay okay that's it for today good job

622
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,440
bye
