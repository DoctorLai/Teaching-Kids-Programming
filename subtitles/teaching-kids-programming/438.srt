1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,359
go hey

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,960
hello mr harry mr ryan are you all right

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,440
okay so today let's talk about the

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,559
binary tree again okay fine number three

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,599
one

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,799
two

7
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,679
three

8
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:17,040
four

9
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,040
five nine binary

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,119
the leaves do not have any kids right

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,320
yeah how many how many notes are besides

12
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,600
their parents

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,200
um

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,760
three and the one we love the parents

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,520
okay so if we remove the leaves now what

16
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,079
what do we get

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,079
we don't need

18
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,559
okay so now how many leaves are there

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,480
all right

20
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,039
how many leaves are there

21
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,760
um one

22
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,920
which is two right see we keep removing

23
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,160
it that would be one okay and then that

24
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,239
would be the only note left that would

25
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,320
be moving because the single note is

26
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,320
also a leaf okay so then we will move it

27
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,479
so look the first term

28
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,439
the first time we remove which is three

29
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,080
four

30
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,880
the second time we remove which is the

31
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,240
two

32
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,190
the third time

33
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,720
is one okay

34
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:21,920
[Music]

35
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,720
do i make myself clear yeah

36
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,000
okay so okay let me repeat it

37
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,880
basically we are removing the leaf nose

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,720
and here we cannot okay so look first

39
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,079
time we remove the three four which is

40
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,840
under this note

41
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,079
and then it become one two and we keep

42
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,360
removing the two which is the leaf now

43
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:43,840
and they become one which uh

44
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,720
but we remove okay okay

45
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,360
okay that's right right okay so

46
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,799
how do we do it i mean how do we do it

47
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,520
with

48
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:56,399
with this kind of problem yeah remember

49
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,439
uh we talked about remove remove the

50
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,520
leaves

51
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,280
yeah of the final tree yeah remove the

52
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,119
even leaves yeah we talked about these

53
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,719
before right but now this is the

54
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,719
slightly a little bit different right

55
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:09,039
because we need to keep removing the

56
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,360
leaves until we cannot right so the best

57
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:14,160
way to do it is to uh

58
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,120
definitely search right remember

59
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,000
so

60
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,840
so

61
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,879
look at this how do we apply the

62
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,360
different search here the key point here

63
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,280
right is that look three and four this

64
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,599
is the

65
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,480
three and four we need to remove it

66
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,480
first and then two and then one

67
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,000
so if we can

68
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,280
can

69
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,160
so if we can remove if we can store the

70
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,200
num

71
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,519
the leaves yeah by their levels so let's

72
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,840
keep a dictionary which is called data

73
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,720
which the keys would be the level okay

74
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,959
what are the depth okay steps

75
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,120
next steps yeah remember the depths and

76
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,400
then little points to the lead to the

77
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,720
nose okay

78
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,680
to the notes

79
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,680
so look here one two three so let's

80
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,239
let's look at these

81
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,560
these four okay these four look if it's

82
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,120
an empty note the the number is zero

83
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,080
okay so look if we're looking if we do

84
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,599
this different search bottom arm yeah

85
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,640
so the note

86
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,720
the empty note has the depth still

87
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,720
the single leaf now has the text one

88
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,800
here this is next one right

89
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,040
here here is this one

90
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,280
why i want to do it

91
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,799
yeah that's one

92
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,640
yeah this here

93
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,480
step two

94
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,799
right here

95
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,280
definitely

96
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:40,959
why is that look because this each note

97
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:43,120
the depth will be determined by the left

98
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,400
the depth of the left tree and the depth

99
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,879
of right tree

100
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,959
plus one right right

101
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,720
yeah so look

102
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,799
what what's the no what's the depth on

103
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,850
this one

104
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,720
what's the depth of this one

105
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:59,120
[Music]

106
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,879
what's the terms of this one two why is

107
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,159
it 2 no look

108
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,480
why is 2

109
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:07,280
that's not never level is 2. i'm saying

110
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,840
the test that's what steps that is the

111
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,680
maximum of the 8 of the left 3 and the

112
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,040
right 3 plus 1

113
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:19,359
right so what i'm saying if the t equals

114
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,359
zero if the note is empty

115
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:26,479
all right so these notes are one always

116
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,440
one right look so this one is one right

117
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,960
yeah

118
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:33,600
this one is one look this is two and one

119
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,120
so i'm standing at that note one yeah

120
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,280
rooted one right

121
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,440
so it's the left tree

122
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,919
this has the depth too this has the

123
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,600
that's one the maximum will be the two

124
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:46,320
and now we get the maximum plus one that

125
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,000
would be a three okay

126
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,360
that makes sense yeah

127
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,759
okay

128
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,280
so let's do this uh let's find this uh

129
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,199
test okay so

130
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,840
find the test and then we can put it in

131
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,400
the dictionary

132
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,600
put it in the dictionary okay so let's

133
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,280
define

134
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,120
that for that

135
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,639
no

136
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,960
okay so let's define this function

137
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,520
return the maximum test come on if not

138
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,639
dude what should we return not do if the

139
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,960
loser is empty what should we pretend

140
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,280
the depth is what if not what should we

141
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,280
return

142
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,880
zero yeah obviously yeah okay then what

143
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,199
let me call the left one we call it the

144
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,039
first search recursion yeah blue dot

145
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,680
left right

146
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:34,080
and then right can you can you copy can

147
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:38,000
you can you do this y equals what come

148
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,600
on left equals definitely y equals one

149
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,039
i'm here

150
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,320
yeah

151
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,320
yeah obviously yeah

152
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,039
and then look now the current level

153
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,479
current level current depth current

154
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,440
depth

155
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,240
equals the maximum

156
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,360
right

157
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,280
maximum what the left

158
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,919
and the right

159
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,840
uh what should we do plus one here right

160
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:07,560
yeah and then we need to return this

161
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,560
steps here return

162
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,800
okay so now we need to put we need to

163
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,840
store

164
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,479
the note this note

165
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,880
by the desk this would be a dictionary

166
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:21,360
which is the key will be the level

167
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,280
will it will be the depth okay

168
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,240
okay confusion death

169
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,919
death is not equal to level okay

170
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,400
yeah when we talk about level let's

171
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:33,039
level by level pressure search right

172
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,360
now the dictionary let's call it data

173
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,120
data default dictionary yeah we can do

174
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,199
it before dictionary

175
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,000
the default dictionary which is the list

176
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,280
type

177
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,039
yeah and then we can do this data

178
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,639
data

179
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,880
depth

180
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:53,360
dot apparent

181
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:55,120
apparently the value okay do the value

182
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,319
why can we do this

183
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:01,039
because list is deposition or at least

184
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,280
right if we don't do this definition if

185
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,880
we declare the dictionary like this a

186
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,080
simple dictionary yeah this is

187
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,919
sympathetic

188
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,160
we can't do this because these steps

189
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,720
might not be the key may not be existent

190
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,039
and we have to do this theta

191
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,039
that's

192
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,520
equals

193
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,960
theta we can use the get function get

194
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,039
the level

195
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,599
get the depth level

196
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:27,120
and then if this key is not existing we

197
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,680
return a simple

198
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,120
empty and then plus

199
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,319
plus a

200
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,720
plus root of value okay this is uh

201
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:40,800
this is this is the way to go if we if

202
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,960
we are using the simple dictionary right

203
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,639
the same partition right using this way

204
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,440
compared to the default dictionary the

205
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,520
main the main difference is that look if

206
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,160
we declare additionally using this way

207
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,000
if a key is not existent

208
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,960
the computer will screen

209
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,960
okay

210
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,400
but for the default decision before

211
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,039
before yeah

212
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:04,319
what's default we'll talk about this the

213
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:06,319
you know the preset value if the key is

214
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,479
not existing it means that okay if the

215
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,759
key is not existing then you will

216
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:14,240
you will give us a default value

217
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,240
of the type list which is

218
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,039
entities okay right

219
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,639
yeah

220
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,120
okay so now look

221
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,120
now this data depth so the data for

222
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,400
points for this one yeah let's write one

223
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,120
two

224
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,560
three four

225
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,879
right come on

226
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,479
yeah okay

227
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,200
look at this look at this final three

228
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,519
again so after this step search what do

229
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,919
we have this data

230
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,959
data this is additional area okay so

231
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,880
never

232
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:46,959
this is level one

233
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:50,720
level one will be three and four okay

234
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:53,200
level two will be only these two right

235
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,880
level three will be one okay

236
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,279
and then what should we return we want

237
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:00,640
to return these this value which is what

238
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,640
we which is what come on

239
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:06,480
this is the keys d what's this

240
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,480
the values where done so we written data

241
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,440
value just that

242
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,120
return

243
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:15,120
first of all we do the step research to

244
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:17,680
do the obviously we call it and return

245
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,560
data dot values

246
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,800
okay

247
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,800
data value will be this one look do you

248
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,080
see this one

249
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,320
one

250
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,640
this is the depth of the nose three

251
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,680
three and four this is that one

252
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:34,880
left two number two or that's two

253
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,480
two step three one okay why is that look

254
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,240
the left and right

255
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,920
the depth the current depth is the

256
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,600
maximum of left or right platform

257
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:47,279
make sense

258
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,279
the time complexity definite search

259
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,640
[Music]

260
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,560
n it's the number of notes in the binary

261
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,880
tree okay because each note gets visited

262
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,839
one space complexity is the same again

263
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,959
okay

264
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,959
yeah

265
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:01,600
okay so what have you learned today the

266
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:04,640
last question about tweet about let's

267
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,640
leave what

268
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:11,040
[Music]

269
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,279
yeah so okay so okay let me give you a

270
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,800
quick question okay

271
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,000
five

272
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,200
six

273
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,320
seven okay so what should we return

274
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,560
what's your opinion

275
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,240
this one two four three five six seven

276
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,800
okay what should we return three five

277
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,680
six seven three five six seven okay and

278
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,720
then

279
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,200
two four

280
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,880
two four and then one exactly this is

281
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,240
easy how about if i don't have this

282
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:39,040
right three six five three six five

283
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,839
yeah three five six i mean uh yeah and

284
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,760
then two four and then one okay so this

285
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:47,360
is probably easy okay how about this if

286
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,240
i give you another one so seven

287
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,440
seven

288
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,680
uh-huh and then one three five six

289
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,760
three seven six yeah

290
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,880
five

291
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,160
two

292
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:02,079
five four five four yeah two two yeah

293
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,800
exactly okay got it okay that's it for

294
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,800
today good job bye
