sit down please so
 

11
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,950
sit down please so
today we talk about these the how do we

12
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:14,960
today we talk about these the how do we
 

13
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,870
today we talk about these the how do we
calculate this the

14
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:16,880
calculate this the
 

15
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,990
calculate this the
power you know mathematic power

16
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:20,000
power you know mathematic power
 

17
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,670
power you know mathematic power
x to the power of n yeah if i tell you x

18
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:23,680
x to the power of n yeah if i tell you x
 

19
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,870
x to the power of n yeah if i tell you x
is some any number 14 numbers

20
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:26,880
is some any number 14 numbers
 

21
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,310
is some any number 14 numbers
1.5 to negative

22
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:30,320
1.5 to negative
 

23
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,350
1.5 to negative
3.5 maybe you know and

24
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:33,360
3.5 maybe you know and
 

25
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,990
3.5 maybe you know and
it's an integer it could be negative as

26
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:36,000
it's an integer it could be negative as
 

27
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,510
it's an integer it could be negative as
well

28
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:37,520
well
 

29
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,630
well
remember okay so when it's positive so

30
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:40,640
remember okay so when it's positive so
 

31
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,430
remember okay so when it's positive so
when it's positive yeah for example like

32
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:43,440
when it's positive yeah for example like
 

33
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,709
when it's positive yeah for example like
2 to the power of 3

34
00:00:44,709 --> 00:00:44,719
2 to the power of 3
 

35
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,069
2 to the power of 3
okay so it means that

36
00:00:48,069 --> 00:00:48,079
okay so it means that
 

37
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,389
okay so it means that
3 times of 2 together yeah 2 times 2

38
00:00:50,389 --> 00:00:50,399
3 times of 2 together yeah 2 times 2
 

39
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:51,189
3 times of 2 together yeah 2 times 2
there are three

40
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:51,199
there are three
 

41
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:54,310
there are three
there are three yeah okay

42
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:54,320
there are three yeah okay
 

43
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:01,430
there are three yeah okay
how about 2 to the power -3

44
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:01,440

 

45
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,149

do you understand no it means that you

46
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:04,159
do you understand no it means that you
 

47
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,070
do you understand no it means that you
can convert it in

48
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:06,080
can convert it in
 

49
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,030
can convert it in
you can because it's negative so this

50
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:09,040
you can because it's negative so this
 

51
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:09,830
you can because it's negative so this
you put one

52
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:09,840
you put one
 

53
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,350
you put one
away yeah yes oh yeah and then

54
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:13,360
away yeah yes oh yeah and then
 

55
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,469
away yeah yes oh yeah and then
three times and this negative and then

56
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:16,479
three times and this negative and then
 

57
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,789
three times and this negative and then
what does it equal

58
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:20,799

 

59
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,910

one one and eight two to the power three

60
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:23,920
one one and eight two to the power three
 

61
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,270
one one and eight two to the power three
one and eight yeah

62
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:25,280
one and eight yeah
 

63
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,590
one and eight yeah
because one to the power of three is one

64
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:27,600
because one to the power of three is one
 

65
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,990
because one to the power of three is one
two to the power three is eight okay

66
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:30,000
two to the power three is eight okay
 

67
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,830
two to the power three is eight okay
yes how about

68
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:33,840
yes how about
 

69
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,230
yes how about
one two three four five to the power of

70
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:36,240
one two three four five to the power of
 

71
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:43,749
one two three four five to the power of
zero

72
00:01:43,749 --> 00:01:43,759

 

73
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,310

how about zero to the power of one two

74
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:46,320
how about zero to the power of one two
 

75
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:46,950
how about zero to the power of one two
three four

76
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:46,960
three four
 

77
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:54,149
three four
five uh

78
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:54,159
five uh
 

79
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,590
five uh
because zero i mean a mean and zero

80
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:57,600
because zero i mean a mean and zero
 

81
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,069
because zero i mean a mean and zero
multiplied together is zero right yeah

82
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:00,079
multiplied together is zero right yeah
 

83
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,030
multiplied together is zero right yeah
yeah okay

84
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:01,040
yeah okay
 

85
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,389
yeah okay
how about one to the power of one two

86
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:04,399
how about one to the power of one two
 

87
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,990
how about one to the power of one two
three four five

88
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,000

 

89
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,190

um

90
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:13,200

 

91
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,430

one two three four five one to the power

92
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:15,440
one two three four five one to the power
 

93
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,110
one two three four five one to the power
of one two three four five one times

94
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:17,120
of one two three four five one times
 

95
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,949
of one two three four five one times
time one equals one

96
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:18,959
time one equals one
 

97
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,990
time one equals one
one and one times a minimum times equals

98
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,000
one and one times a minimum times equals
 

99
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,990
one and one times a minimum times equals
what one yeah one

100
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:26,000
what one yeah one
 

101
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,150
what one yeah one
okay so these are three special cases

102
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,160
okay so these are three special cases
 

103
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,350
okay so these are three special cases
yeah and this

104
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:29,360
yeah and this
 

105
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,070
yeah and this
is you these cases you need you can turn

106
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:32,080
is you these cases you need you can turn
 

107
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,430
is you these cases you need you can turn
the negative power

108
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:33,440
the negative power
 

109
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,030
the negative power
into the positive power right yes okay

110
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:37,040
into the positive power right yes okay
 

111
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,229
into the positive power right yes okay
so if there are

112
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:40,239
so if there are
 

113
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,390
so if there are
n n x how do you calculate these

114
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:44,400
n n x how do you calculate these
 

115
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,830
n n x how do you calculate these
and x x and x to the power of n

116
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:48,840
and x x and x to the power of n
 

117
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,830
and x x and x to the power of n
define power

118
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:51,840
define power
 

119
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,070
define power
x comma and what's missing here

120
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:56,080
x comma and what's missing here
 

121
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,589
x comma and what's missing here
okay so when we write the we write the

122
00:02:59,589 --> 00:02:59,599
okay so when we write the we write the
 

123
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,270
okay so when we write the we write the
spatial case yeah if x equals

124
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:03,280
spatial case yeah if x equals
 

125
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,309
spatial case yeah if x equals
one right yeah all n

126
00:03:06,309 --> 00:03:06,319
one right yeah all n
 

127
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,430
one right yeah all n
equals zero

128
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:09,440
equals zero
 

129
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,710
equals zero
return

130
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:12,720

 

131
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,750

zero no no no one one

132
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:15,760
zero no no no one one
 

133
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:29,270
zero no no no one one
one

134
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:29,280

 

135
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,309

if if

136
00:03:32,309 --> 00:03:32,319
if if
 

137
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,670
if if
n smaller than zero okay

138
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:35,680
n smaller than zero okay
 

139
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,789
n smaller than zero okay
so now remember x equals

140
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:38,799
so now remember x equals
 

141
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,430
so now remember x equals
x and n x will become 1.0 divided by x

142
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:43,440
x and n x will become 1.0 divided by x
 

143
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,390
x and n x will become 1.0 divided by x
right yeah remember that 2 to the power

144
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:46,400
right yeah remember that 2 to the power
 

145
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:46,949
right yeah remember that 2 to the power
3.

146
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:46,959
3.
 

147
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,309
3.
x will become these right and these will

148
00:03:50,309 --> 00:03:50,319
x will become these right and these will
 

149
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,030
x will become these right and these will
become

150
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:51,040
become
 

151
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,910
become
these yeah it's the same thing yeah yeah

152
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:53,920
these yeah it's the same thing yeah yeah
 

153
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,550
these yeah it's the same thing yeah yeah
so

154
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:54,560
so
 

155
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,350
so
actually become this n will become what

156
00:03:59,350 --> 00:03:59,360

 

157
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,550

the negative becomes positive minus

158
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:02,560
the negative becomes positive minus
 

159
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,429
the negative becomes positive minus
n right yeah n is minus three and then

160
00:04:05,429 --> 00:04:05,439
n right yeah n is minus three and then
 

161
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,910
n right yeah n is minus three and then
minus minus two equals three right

162
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:07,920
minus minus two equals three right
 

163
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,309
minus minus two equals three right
okay so these last cases so now

164
00:04:12,309 --> 00:04:12,319
okay so these last cases so now
 

165
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,710
okay so these last cases so now
how do you how do we implement this x

166
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:14,720
how do you how do we implement this x
 

167
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,350
how do you how do we implement this x
and

168
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:15,360
and
 

169
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,870
and
the very simple way you just terms x

170
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:18,880
the very simple way you just terms x
 

171
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,270
the very simple way you just terms x
n times yeah okay so how do we do it we

172
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:21,280
n times yeah okay so how do we do it we
 

173
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,469
n times yeah okay so how do we do it we
got the answer

174
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:22,479
got the answer
 

175
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:27,510
got the answer
beginning will be one right yeah

176
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:27,520

 

177
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,790

then for anything you know

178
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:30,800
then for anything you know
 

179
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,030
then for anything you know
you can use understood score if you're

180
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,040
you can use understood score if you're
 

181
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,870
you can use understood score if you're
not using the value

182
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:34,880
not using the value
 

183
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,189
not using the value
in range what

184
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:39,199
in range what
 

185
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:47,510
in range what
range x and

186
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:47,520

 

187
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,590

times times y times

188
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:51,600
times times y times
 

189
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,749
times times y times
what times x return

190
00:04:57,749 --> 00:04:57,759
what times x return
 

191
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,189
what times x return
later on we're done you see this is

192
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:01,199
later on we're done you see this is
 

193
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,749
later on we're done you see this is
exactly this is the very simple case yes

194
00:05:03,749 --> 00:05:03,759
exactly this is the very simple case yes
 

195
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:04,710
exactly this is the very simple case yes
yeah easy

196
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:04,720
yeah easy
 

197
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,070
yeah easy
to get the problem but look if

198
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,080
to get the problem but look if
 

199
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,430
to get the problem but look if
if x is an even number

200
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:11,440
if x is an even number
 

201
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,909
if x is an even number
now that's all number right like two to

202
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:13,919
now that's all number right like two to
 

203
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,110
now that's all number right like two to
the power of three

204
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:15,120
the power of three
 

205
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,150
the power of three
these three is order yeah yeah

206
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:18,160
these three is order yeah yeah
 

207
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,230
these three is order yeah yeah
effect otd yeah odd number yeah

208
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:22,240
effect otd yeah odd number yeah
 

209
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,350
effect otd yeah odd number yeah
so e equals 2

210
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:25,360
so e equals 2
 

211
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,629
so e equals 2
times 2 to the power of 2 right

212
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:28,639
times 2 to the power of 2 right
 

213
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,390
times 2 to the power of 2 right
yeah because there are 3 2's then i i

214
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:30,400
yeah because there are 3 2's then i i
 

215
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,830
yeah because there are 3 2's then i i
take 1 2 out

216
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:31,840
take 1 2 out
 

217
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,749
take 1 2 out
and times it will be 2 to the power of 2

218
00:05:33,749 --> 00:05:33,759
and times it will be 2 to the power of 2
 

219
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,430
and times it will be 2 to the power of 2
right yes

220
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:35,440
right yes
 

221
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,909
right yes
look this is a this is 2 times 4 is a

222
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:37,919
look this is a this is 2 times 4 is a
 

223
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,790
look this is a this is 2 times 4 is a
right

224
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:38,800
right
 

225
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,950
right
okay let's do another example

226
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:42,960
okay let's do another example
 

227
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,830
okay let's do another example
3 to the power of 4 this is even number

228
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:45,840
3 to the power of 4 this is even number
 

229
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,550
3 to the power of 4 this is even number
now right

230
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:46,560
now right
 

231
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,830
now right
even number yeah yes what does it equal

232
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:49,840
even number yeah yes what does it equal
 

233
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,510
even number yeah yes what does it equal
does it equal what's this number

234
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:53,520
does it equal what's this number
 

235
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,110
does it equal what's this number
81 right 3 times 3 times 3 times 3

236
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:57,120
81 right 3 times 3 times 3 times 3
 

237
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,430
81 right 3 times 3 times 3 times 3
81 so does it equal 3 to the power of 2

238
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:01,440
81 so does it equal 3 to the power of 2
 

239
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,350
81 so does it equal 3 to the power of 2
and times 3 to the power of 2 right

240
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:05,360
and times 3 to the power of 2 right
 

241
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,870
and times 3 to the power of 2 right
yeah this is like this is not yeah so

242
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:08,880
yeah this is like this is not yeah so
 

243
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,629
yeah this is like this is not yeah so
so what what this four i can divide it

244
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:12,639
so what what this four i can divide it
 

245
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,270
so what what this four i can divide it
so

246
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:13,280
so
 

247
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,749
so
basically when this is even number i can

248
00:06:15,749 --> 00:06:15,759
basically when this is even number i can
 

249
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,670
basically when this is even number i can
do this i can reduce it to half

250
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:17,680
do this i can reduce it to half
 

251
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,150
do this i can reduce it to half
and then i can square it right i can

252
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,160
and then i can square it right i can
 

253
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,950
and then i can square it right i can
square it

254
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:20,960
square it
 

255
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,629
square it
yes yeah so

256
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:24,639
yes yeah so
 

257
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,110
yes yeah so
this time you need to do three times

258
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:27,120
this time you need to do three times
 

259
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,670
this time you need to do three times
right

260
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:27,680
right
 

261
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,990
right
four times yeah three times three times

262
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:30,000
four times yeah three times three times
 

263
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,189
four times yeah three times three times
three times three

264
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:31,199
three times three
 

265
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,790
three times three
right yeah yeah three times three

266
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:34,800
right yeah yeah three times three
 

267
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,029
right yeah yeah three times three
times three times actually three times

268
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:37,039
times three times actually three times
 

269
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,309
times three times actually three times
as well

270
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:38,319
as well
 

271
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,990
as well
uh at least three times

272
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:42,000
uh at least three times
 

273
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,230
uh at least three times
you need to do three multiplication here

274
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:44,240
you need to do three multiplication here
 

275
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,430
you need to do three multiplication here
how about this

276
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:45,440
how about this
 

277
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,469
how about this
three times three one time

278
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:48,479
three times three one time
 

279
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,510
three times three one time
square it one time

280
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:51,520
square it one time
 

281
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,390
square it one time
so that's two times uh two times yeah so

282
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:54,400
so that's two times uh two times yeah so
 

283
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,230
so that's two times uh two times yeah so
you see this is faster

284
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:56,240
you see this is faster
 

285
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,990
you see this is faster
yeah okay so if

286
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,000
yeah okay so if
 

287
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,430
yeah okay so if
if like let's say 3 to 100 power 2 to

288
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:03,440
if like let's say 3 to 100 power 2 to
 

289
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,390
if like let's say 3 to 100 power 2 to
the power 100

290
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:04,400
the power 100
 

291
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,510
the power 100
you turn 3 to get 100 times this is oh

292
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:07,520
you turn 3 to get 100 times this is oh
 

293
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,029
you turn 3 to get 100 times this is oh
what complexity over i

294
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:11,039
what complexity over i
 

295
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,150
what complexity over i
if this is an over

296
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:14,160
if this is an over
 

297
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,070
if this is an over
because yes you are right because you

298
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:16,080
because yes you are right because you
 

299
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,990
because yes you are right because you
need to multiply three

300
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:18,000
need to multiply three
 

301
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,189
need to multiply three
a hundred ten times yes how about

302
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:21,199
a hundred ten times yes how about
 

303
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,629
a hundred ten times yes how about
if i do this i can for to take a release

304
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:24,639
if i do this i can for to take a release
 

305
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,749
if i do this i can for to take a release
i can calculate this becomes three power

306
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:27,759
i can calculate this becomes three power
 

307
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:28,070
i can calculate this becomes three power
of

308
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,080
of
 

309
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,350
of
fifty and then i can square it right

310
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:31,360
fifty and then i can square it right
 

311
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,469
fifty and then i can square it right
yes and in order to take your lease

312
00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:34,479
yes and in order to take your lease
 

313
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,270
yes and in order to take your lease
i can do this 3 to the power of 25

314
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:37,280
i can do this 3 to the power of 25
 

315
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,309
i can do this 3 to the power of 25
square

316
00:07:38,309 --> 00:07:38,319
square
 

317
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,830
square
squared right yes and the 3 to the power

318
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:41,840
squared right yes and the 3 to the power
 

319
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,550
squared right yes and the 3 to the power
25

320
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:42,560
25
 

321
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,029
25
is even odd number size is equals 3

322
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:45,039
is even odd number size is equals 3
 

323
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:45,830
is even odd number size is equals 3
times

324
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:45,840
times
 

325
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,150
times
3 to the power 24 right and this thing

326
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:50,160
3 to the power 24 right and this thing
 

327
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,430
3 to the power 24 right and this thing
3 to the power of 12 squared

328

3 to the power of 12 squared
 

329
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,150
3 to the power of 12 squared
you see so what's the complexity

330
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:58,160
you see so what's the complexity
 

331
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,589
you see so what's the complexity
uh logan wow brilliant

that's what i'm looking for exactly very

334
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:03,919
that's what i'm looking for exactly very
 

335
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,589
that's what i'm looking for exactly very
clever oh my god you

336
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:05,599
clever oh my god you
 

337
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,790
clever oh my god you
you follow that is big brain yeah

338
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:08,800
you follow that is big brain yeah
 

339
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,469
you follow that is big brain yeah
okay that's good so you understand this

340
00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:10,479
okay that's good so you understand this
 

341
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:11,990
okay that's good so you understand this
okay so we can implement

342
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:12,000
okay so we can implement
 

343
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,189
okay so we can implement
this so look we this we can use it yeah

344
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:15,199
this so look we this we can use it yeah
 

345
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,150
this so look we this we can use it yeah
because this we can

346
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:16,160
because this we can
 

347
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,430
because this we can
use it yeah okay we can reuse this bit

348
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:19,440
use it yeah okay we can reuse this bit
 

349
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,710
use it yeah okay we can reuse this bit
but

350
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:22,720

 

351
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,629

but now we're going to remove this

352
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:28,639

 

353
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,389

look then look if

354
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:32,399
look then look if
 

355
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,750
look then look if
n is odd number so it's all number we

356
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:35,760
n is odd number so it's all number we
 

357
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,070
n is odd number so it's all number we
can use this yeah

358
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:38,080
can use this yeah
 

359
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,029
can use this yeah
or number equals one right yeah all you

360
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:41,039
or number equals one right yeah all you
 

361
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:41,829
or number equals one right yeah all you
can do is

362
00:08:41,829 --> 00:08:41,839
can do is
 

363
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,149
can do is
remember in binary the odd number the

364
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:44,159
remember in binary the odd number the
 

365
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,670
remember in binary the odd number the
last bit is one right

366
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:45,680
last bit is one right
 

367
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,389
last bit is one right
yes the binary zero one two that's one

368
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:48,399
yes the binary zero one two that's one
 

369
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,750
yes the binary zero one two that's one
zero one

370
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:49,760
zero one
 

371
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,509
zero one
uh one or zero that's five right

372
00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:53,519
uh one or zero that's five right
 

373
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,070
uh one or zero that's five right
this is always one the least small least

374
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:56,080
this is always one the least small least
 

375
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,990
this is always one the least small least
significant bit we call it

376
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:58,000
significant bit we call it
 

377
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,269
significant bit we call it
this sniffing provider least

378
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:01,279
this sniffing provider least
 

379
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,630
this sniffing provider least
significant bit in binary is the right

380
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:04,640
significant bit in binary is the right
 

381
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,870
significant bit in binary is the right
mode so you can do it you can also write

382
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:06,880
mode so you can do it you can also write
 

383
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,470
mode so you can do it you can also write
this n if n n is in binary

384
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:10,480
this n if n n is in binary
 

385
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,990
this n if n n is in binary
n one then do this equals one okay and

386
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:14,000
n one then do this equals one okay and
 

387
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,389
n one then do this equals one okay and
then

388
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:14,399
then
 

389
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,070
then
what if it's all number so

390
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:18,080
what if it's all number so
 

391
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,190
what if it's all number so
we can do it recursively return

392
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:21,200
we can do it recursively return
 

393
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,310
we can do it recursively return
x times

394
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:24,320
x times
 

395
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,990
x times
times y n no no no

396
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:28,000
times y n no no no
 

397
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,269
times y n no no no
x times power

398
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:31,279
x times power
 

399
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,310
x times power
x and minus one right yeah yeah

400
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:34,320
x and minus one right yeah yeah
 

401
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,790
x and minus one right yeah yeah
look we take one x and then we have n

402
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:36,800
look we take one x and then we have n
 

403
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,030
look we take one x and then we have n
minus one x left

404
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,040
minus one x left
 

405
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,430
minus one x left
if it's an even number let's do it y

406
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:41,440
if it's an even number let's do it y
 

407
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,790
if it's an even number let's do it y
equals

408
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:42,800
equals
 

409
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,630
equals
power and you tell me what what's legs

410
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:44,640
power and you tell me what what's legs
 

411
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,630
power and you tell me what what's legs
okay x

412
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:46,640
okay x
 

413
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,070
okay x
and divided by two half remember

414
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:50,080
and divided by two half remember
 

415
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,590
and divided by two half remember
and then written one remember the square

416
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:53,600
and then written one remember the square
 

417
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,389
and then written one remember the square
thing

418
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:54,399
thing
 

419
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:59,110
thing
thing three to a hundred equals 350

420
00:09:59,110 --> 00:09:59,120
thing three to a hundred equals 350
 

421
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:16,829
thing three to a hundred equals 350
square okay so where's your player

422
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:16,839

 

423
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:22,230

100

424
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:22,240

 

425
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,269

yeah y times y y squared yeah y times

426
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:25,279
yeah y times y y squared yeah y times
 

427
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,269
yeah y times y y squared yeah y times
y or y squared or power y okay

428
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:29,279
y or y squared or power y okay
 

429
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,069
y or y squared or power y okay
okay this is this one is we call it

430
00:10:32,069 --> 00:10:32,079
okay this is this one is we call it
 

431
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:33,110
okay this is this one is we call it
recursion yeah

432
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:33,120
recursion yeah
 

433
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,829
recursion yeah
look this is the question calling itself

434
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:35,839
look this is the question calling itself
 

435
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,509
look this is the question calling itself
calling itself

436
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:37,519
calling itself
 

437
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,350
calling itself
and we can do it iteratively

438
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:41,360
and we can do it iteratively
 

439
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,670
and we can do it iteratively
so this is the last iterator so y

440
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:45,680
so this is the last iterator so y
 

441
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,710
so this is the last iterator so y
and smaller than or equal to one right

442
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:48,720
and smaller than or equal to one right
 

443
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,470
and smaller than or equal to one right
we've got the answer here answer equals

444
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:50,480
we've got the answer here answer equals
 

445
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,389
we've got the answer here answer equals
one if

446
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:52,399
one if
 

447
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,630
one if
n is odd number answer

448
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:56,640
n is odd number answer
 

449
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,470
n is odd number answer
times x right and then we need to x

450
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:00,480
times x right and then we need to x
 

451
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,590
times x right and then we need to x
times excel right x becomes

452
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:03,600
times excel right x becomes
 

453
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,870
times excel right x becomes
x x becomes x times x

454
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:06,880
x x becomes x times x
 

455
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,069
x x becomes x times x
so x times x okay and then n

456
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:10,079
so x times x okay and then n
 

457
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,750
so x times x okay and then n
will reduce to half so n divided by two

458
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:13,760
will reduce to half so n divided by two
 

459
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,710
will reduce to half so n divided by two
right so n equals n divided by two

460
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:18,720
right so n equals n divided by two
 

461
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,350
right so n equals n divided by two
divided by two all you can do is this

462
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:21,360
divided by two all you can do is this
 

463
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,389
divided by two all you can do is this
shifting look

464
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:22,399
shifting look
 

465
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,750
shifting look
double equal this means double

466
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:25,760
double equal this means double
 

467
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,190
double equal this means double
crochet this this means what for example

468
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:29,200
crochet this this means what for example
 

469
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,350
crochet this this means what for example
this is shifting rook binary

470
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:31,360
this is shifting rook binary
 

471
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,550
this is shifting rook binary
one zero one zero doing this if n is

472
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:34,560
one zero one zero doing this if n is
 

473
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,670
one zero one zero doing this if n is
this n is what

474
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:35,680
this n is what
 

475
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,069
this n is what
four plus two this is six in binary

476
00:11:38,069 --> 00:11:38,079
four plus two this is six in binary
 

477
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,190
four plus two this is six in binary
right yeah

478
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:39,200
right yeah
 

479
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,310
right yeah
this is this is six

480
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:42,320
this is this is six
 

481
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,630
this is this is six
okay so doing this if i shift one

482
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:44,640
okay so doing this if i shift one
 

483
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,710
okay so doing this if i shift one
position to the right where it becomes

484
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:48,720

 

485
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,670

i shift it shift it with the shifted so

486
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:51,680
i shift it shift it with the shifted so
 

487
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,790
i shift it shift it with the shifted so
you become

488
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:52,800
you become
 

489
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,030
you become
zero one zero one okay so this one the

490
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:55,040
zero one zero one okay so this one the
 

491
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,990
zero one zero one okay so this one the
yellow is gone

492
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:56,000
yellow is gone
 

493
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,790
yellow is gone
right it's gone it's 15 and then they'll

494
00:11:58,790 --> 00:11:58,800
right it's gone it's 15 and then they'll
 

495
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,430
right it's gone it's 15 and then they'll
become

496
00:11:59,430 --> 00:11:59,440
become
 

497
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,550
become
what six again

498
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:02,560
what six again
 

499
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,790
what six again
no that'll be three you see so it means

500
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:04,800
no that'll be three you see so it means
 

501
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,990
no that'll be three you see so it means
divided by half

502
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:06,000
divided by half
 

503
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,030
divided by half
okay so if because it's binary if i

504
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:09,040
okay so if because it's binary if i
 

505
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,430
okay so if because it's binary if i
if i put a zero at the end it means the

506
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:11,440
if i put a zero at the end it means the
 

507
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,230
if i put a zero at the end it means the
shifting

508
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:12,240
shifting
 

509
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,470
shifting
to the left then you'll be the value

510
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:14,480
to the left then you'll be the value
 

511
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,670
to the left then you'll be the value
will be double

512
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:15,680
will be double
 

513
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,310
will be double
right if i am shifting to the right i

514
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:18,320
right if i am shifting to the right i
 

515
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,310
right if i am shifting to the right i
get rid of one zero at the end

516
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:20,320
get rid of one zero at the end
 

517
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,670
get rid of one zero at the end
now being divided by twelve ah two right

518
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:23,680
now being divided by twelve ah two right
 

519
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,030
now being divided by twelve ah two right
okay so this is the the same as the same

520
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:27,040
okay so this is the the same as the same
 

521
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,350
okay so this is the the same as the same
as

522
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:27,360
as
 

523
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,069
as
n equals n divided by two okay it's the

524
00:12:30,069 --> 00:12:30,079
n equals n divided by two okay it's the
 

525
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,509
n equals n divided by two okay it's the
same thing okay

526
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:31,519
same thing okay
 

527
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:45,350
same thing okay
okay so now let's do recording

528
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:45,360

 

529
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,550

can you sit there please i reckon

530
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:50,560
can you sit there please i reckon
 

531
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,470
can you sit there please i reckon
yeah it's very clear that's it i need to

532
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:54,480
yeah it's very clear that's it i need to
 

533
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,190
yeah it's very clear that's it i need to
use this computer

534
00:12:59,190 --> 00:12:59,200

 

535
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,310

okay good we are very good

536
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:02,320
okay good we are very good
 

537
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,829
okay good we are very good
it's very clear can you check thank you

538
00:13:04,829 --> 00:13:04,839
it's very clear can you check thank you
 

539
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,670
it's very clear can you check thank you
okay

540
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:07,680
okay
 

541
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,910
okay
okay let's do it call

542
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:11,920
okay let's do it call
 

543
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,470
okay let's do it call
okay power so oh yes

544
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:16,480
okay power so oh yes
 

545
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,750
okay power so oh yes
so let's let's do the first first uh

546
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:19,760
so let's let's do the first first uh
 

547
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,750
so let's let's do the first first uh
first version okay first version

548
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:21,760
first version okay first version
 

549
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,269
first version okay first version
x n so you tell me if

550
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:25,279
x n so you tell me if
 

551
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,550
x n so you tell me if
x equals one

552
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:28,560
x equals one
 

553
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,829
x equals one
or n equals zero what should we return

554
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:31,839
or n equals zero what should we return
 

555
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,269
or n equals zero what should we return
we turn one yeah if x

556
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:35,279
we turn one yeah if x
 

557
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,509
we turn one yeah if x
equals zero what's we determine because

558
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:37,519
equals zero what's we determine because
 

559
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,030
equals zero what's we determine because
zero

560
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:39,040
zero
 

561
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,990
zero
okay then if n smaller than zero then we

562
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:42,000
okay then if n smaller than zero then we
 

563
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,629
okay then if n smaller than zero then we
need to

564
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:42,639
need to
 

565
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,150
need to
do x and equals one

566
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:46,160
do x and equals one
 

567
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,790
do x and equals one
1.0 divided by x and what

568
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:50,800

 

569
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,269

minus n we are negative okay then let's

570
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:53,279
minus n we are negative okay then let's
 

571
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,150
minus n we are negative okay then let's
do the very

572
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:54,160
do the very
 

573
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,790
do the very
first version let's put it uh in the

574
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:56,800
first version let's put it uh in the
 

575
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,629
first version let's put it uh in the
answer answer equals one

576
00:13:58,629 --> 00:13:58,639
answer answer equals one
 

577
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,030
answer answer equals one
for uh in range range renoir

578
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:03,040
for uh in range range renoir
 

579
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,710
for uh in range range renoir
range and then

580
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:06,720
range and then
 

581
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:16,949
range and then
answer equals answer times what

582
00:14:16,949 --> 00:14:16,959
answer equals answer times what
 

583
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,990
answer equals answer times what
what are we multiplying x yes

584
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:20,000
what are we multiplying x yes
 

585
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,470
what are we multiplying x yes
and we can

586
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:26,480

 

587
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:32,710

what are we calculating here

588
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:32,720

 

589
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,750

okay let's do check some value first

590
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:35,760
okay let's do check some value first
 

591
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,150
okay let's do check some value first
okay

592
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:36,160
okay
 

593
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,230
okay
power one two to the power of ten yeah

594
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:40,240
power one two to the power of ten yeah
 

595
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,269
power one two to the power of ten yeah
three power one two to the power of

596
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:43,279
three power one two to the power of
 

597
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,110
three power one two to the power of
minus 3 okay

598
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:45,120
minus 3 okay
 

599
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,629
minus 3 okay
okay 1 to

600
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:48,639
okay 1 to
 

601
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,310
okay 1 to
a 100 1

602
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:52,320
a 100 1
 

603
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,829
a 100 1
between power 1 uh

604
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:56,839
between power 1 uh
 

605
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:10,069
between power 1 uh
uh

606
00:15:10,069 --> 00:15:10,079

 

607
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,829

yes okay this is great okay let's do the

608
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:13,839
yes okay this is great okay let's do the
 

609
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,509
yes okay this is great okay let's do the
uh second version okay

610
00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:17,519
uh second version okay
 

611
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,710
uh second version okay
so second version

612
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:20,720
so second version
 

613
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,069
so second version
define power to

614
00:15:24,069 --> 00:15:24,079
define power to
 

615
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,189
define power to
xn so these will be the same yeah x

616
00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:27,199
xn so these will be the same yeah x
 

617
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:27,990
xn so these will be the same yeah x
equals one

618
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:28,000
equals one
 

619
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,189
equals one
or n equals zero uh return

620
00:15:31,189 --> 00:15:31,199
or n equals zero uh return
 

621
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,790
or n equals zero uh return
one if x equals zero

622
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:34,800
one if x equals zero
 

623
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,110
one if x equals zero
returns zero if smaller than zero then

624
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:39,120
returns zero if smaller than zero then
 

625
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,749
returns zero if smaller than zero then
we

626
00:15:39,749 --> 00:15:39,759
we
 

627
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,870
we
do this x n equals one

628
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:42,880
do this x n equals one
 

629
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,030
do this x n equals one
divided by x minus n and then we do this

630
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:47,040
divided by x minus n and then we do this
 

631
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,189
divided by x minus n and then we do this
if uh if

632
00:15:51,189 --> 00:15:51,199
if uh if
 

633
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,710
if uh if
and this is odd number then it return

634
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:54,720
and this is odd number then it return
 

635
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,790
and this is odd number then it return
power to

636
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:56,800
power to
 

637
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,910
power to
x n minus 1

638
00:15:59,910 --> 00:15:59,920
x n minus 1
 

639
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,030
x n minus 1
and times x y

640
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:03,040
and times x y
 

641
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,710
and times x y
yes otherwise i return otherwise i need

642
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:06,720
yes otherwise i return otherwise i need
 

643
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,030
yes otherwise i return otherwise i need
to

644
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:07,040
to
 

645
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,870
to
save this value power to x and divide by

646
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:10,880
save this value power to x and divide by
 

647
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,590
save this value power to x and divide by
two right

648
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:11,600
two right
 

649
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,350
two right
yeah and then return y times y or y

650
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:15,360
yeah and then return y times y or y
 

651
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,990
yeah and then return y times y or y
you can do this as well okay yeah okay

652
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,000
you can do this as well okay yeah okay
 

653
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,590
you can do this as well okay yeah okay
so let's see

654
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:19,600
so let's see
 

655
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:26,730
so let's see
let's change this to

656
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:26,740

yeah yeah

670
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:54,320

 

671
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,310

define power three x n so basically

672
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:58,320
define power three x n so basically
 

673
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,829
define power three x n so basically
let's do it

674
00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:01,839

 

675
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,870

return one if x

676
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:04,880
return one if x
 

677
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,390
return one if x
equals zero return zero

678
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:08,400
equals zero return zero
 

679
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,590
equals zero return zero
if x n smaller than zero

680
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:11,600
if x n smaller than zero
 

681
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,789
if x n smaller than zero
x n equals one i x and minus

682
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:14,799
x n equals one i x and minus
 

683
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,230
x n equals one i x and minus
n and i look answer equals one

684
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:18,240
n and i look answer equals one
 

685
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,590
n and i look answer equals one
okay so y n is bigger than one

686
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:21,600
okay so y n is bigger than one
 

687
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,590
okay so y n is bigger than one
then we do this if n is odd number

688
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:25,600
then we do this if n is odd number
 

689
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,350
then we do this if n is odd number
answer times x and then x

690
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:29,360
answer times x and then x
 

691
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,470
answer times x and then x
times itself and then n will become

692
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:32,480
times itself and then n will become
 

693
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,270
times itself and then n will become
become

694
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:33,280
become
 

695
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,070
become
uh half right and you can answer

696
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:38,080
uh half right and you can answer
 

697
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,549
uh half right and you can answer
and that's the third version okay

698
00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:42,559
and that's the third version okay
 

699
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,510
and that's the third version okay
it's a bit low that's okay stays it

700
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:45,520
it's a bit low that's okay stays it
 

701
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,070
it's a bit low that's okay stays it
doesn't

702
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:46,080
doesn't
 

703
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,710
doesn't
matter let's do this

704
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:50,720

 

705
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,510

yes it's the same yeah yeah okay so

706
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:53,520
yes it's the same yeah yeah okay so
 

707
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,909
yes it's the same yeah yeah okay so
actually there's a false version

708
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:55,919
actually there's a false version
 

709
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,190
actually there's a false version
really because we are inventing

710
00:17:59,190 --> 00:17:59,200
really because we are inventing
 

711
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,190
really because we are inventing
this is how we calculate it but already

712
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:01,200
this is how we calculate it but already
 

713
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,270
this is how we calculate it but already
the computer already know how to do it

714
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:03,280
the computer already know how to do it
 

715
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,630
the computer already know how to do it
or already defined it so we can just do

716
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:06,640
or already defined it so we can just do
 

717
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,230
or already defined it so we can just do
this

718
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:08,240
this
 

719
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,310
this
it's already supported by python right

720
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:10,320
it's already supported by python right
 

721
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,750
it's already supported by python right
you can do this

722
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:11,760
you can do this
 

723
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,789
you can do this
double star yeah

724
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:14,799
double star yeah
 

725
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:24,070
double star yeah
this is the same thing okay

726
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:24,080

 

727
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:40,230

so we don't need my powerful

728
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:40,240

 

729
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,430

which one is better do you think

730
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:43,440
which one is better do you think
 

731
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,110
which one is better do you think
which one do you think which one do you

732
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:45,120
which one do you think which one do you
 

733
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,029
which one do you think which one do you
like the better do you like the first

734
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:47,039
like the better do you like the first
 

735
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,950
like the better do you like the first
version

736
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:48,960
version
 

737
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,789
version
it's easy to understand look it's just

738
00:18:50,789 --> 00:18:50,799
it's easy to understand look it's just
 

739
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,350
it's easy to understand look it's just
times times expected to

740
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:53,360
times times expected to
 

741
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:58,630
times times expected to
is it the phartest or the notice

742
00:18:58,630 --> 00:18:58,640

 

743
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,230

i think it's

744
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:02,240

 

745
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,549

like yes no because you need to times if

746
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:04,559
like yes no because you need to times if
 

747
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,070
like yes no because you need to times if
n is armenian you need to times

748
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:06,080
n is armenian you need to times
 

749
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,029
n is armenian you need to times
n a million times right but this is on

750
00:19:09,029 --> 00:19:09,039
n a million times right but this is on
 

751
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:09,990
n a million times right but this is on
the power 2 and power

752
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:10,000
the power 2 and power
 

753
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,270
the power 2 and power
3 oh this is all log n right

754
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:13,280
3 oh this is all log n right
 

755
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,390
3 oh this is all log n right
so it's much smaller yeah in the times

756
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:16,400
so it's much smaller yeah in the times
 

757
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,430
so it's much smaller yeah in the times
it's always reducing look the important

758
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:19,440
it's always reducing look the important
 

759
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,470
it's always reducing look the important
thing is that when it's

760
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:20,480
thing is that when it's
 

761
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,110
thing is that when it's
all when it's even number the end will

762
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:23,120
all when it's even number the end will
 

763
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:23,669
all when it's even number the end will
become

764
00:19:23,669 --> 00:19:23,679
become
 

765
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,789
become
half right so it's going to be three

766
00:19:26,789 --> 00:19:26,799
half right so it's going to be three
 

767
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,630
half right so it's going to be three
yeah yeah it would be reduced to

768
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:28,640
yeah yeah it would be reduced to
 

769
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,669
yeah yeah it would be reduced to
100 becomes 50 50 will become 25. you

770
00:19:31,669 --> 00:19:31,679
100 becomes 50 50 will become 25. you
 

771
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:32,150
100 becomes 50 50 will become 25. you
see

772
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:32,160
see
 

773
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,350
see
so it's it needs three times to reduce

774
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:35,360
so it's it needs three times to reduce
 

775
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,470
so it's it needs three times to reduce
from 100 to

776
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:36,480
from 100 to
 

777
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,750
from 100 to
25 but it takes 75 times to reduce from

778
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:40,760
25 but it takes 75 times to reduce from
 

779
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,430
25 but it takes 75 times to reduce from
125 right you see the difference

780
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:43,440
125 right you see the difference
 

781
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,990
125 right you see the difference
yeah yeah okay good job today good job

782
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:46,000
