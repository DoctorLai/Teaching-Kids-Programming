5
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,200
lessons

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,120
what what have we talked about last

7
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,320
question just give me a keyword

8
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,640
again

9
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,279
and we talk about

10
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,520
game okay game series okay we talk about

11
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:24,320
a number halfling game yeah number

12
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:27,599
hovering given the number

13
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,519
given a number yeah you can subtract one

14
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,679
or you can divide it by two and whoever

15
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,840
gets to zero wins yeah and we also talk

16
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,200
about a quick center right

17
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,440
stick

18
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,440
tap

19
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,040
tick tick tock okay how hard it is

20
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,960
character detector okay

21
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,840
yeah yeah

22
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,680
we

23
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,079
we talked about again

24
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,039
terminologies yeah we have to talk about

25
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:55,039
some terminology the state yeah state

26
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,199
we have a star state

27
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:01,760
the state is the describes the current

28
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,039
status of the game like uh you know

29
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,040
what's the

30
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,920
state of the game yeah like who's who is

31
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:12,159
going to play next yeah starting

32
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:15,040
we talk about what we talk about

33
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:18,000
is end so this function will return if

34
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,960
the game can be continued around or not

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,040
right

36
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,960
so if the game has

37
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:27,439
has ended so if it's at zero usually we

38
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,720
give a zero to a game who is uh you know

39
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:32,640
nobody wins it's a draw okay and then

40
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,720
that time

41
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,119
yeah yeah because the number again

42
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,560
there's no draw right yeah

43
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,479
somebody has to wait for the number

44
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,680
however drawing okay no more hovering

45
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:46,960
game and then we have a utility function

46
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:50,000
utility function describes that

47
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,920
the whoever screen in the end game only

48
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,520
applies to that game right and then we

49
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,240
also have what

50
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,360
we also have what kind of elements so

51
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,520
stay

52
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,479
is end utility

53
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,280
and then success okay success

54
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,840
so given a state and a given action and

55
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,800
you need to tell

56
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,800
me come in the next state okay yeah can

57
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,239
you know what's around here and also we

58
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,239
have the action

59
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,879
reaction for the number huffling again

60
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,879
is the two only two action either you

61
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,480
divide or you

62
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,200
subtract right

63
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,319
so these are the basic elements what

64
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,239
else

65
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,040
what else

66
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,599
so

67
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,680
this is the two player zero something

68
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:36,080
two player yeah each turn each player

69
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,160
takes turn like i play one you play one

70
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,599
you know take turns

71
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,840
zero sum

72
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:45,920
somebody wins the other has to lose

73
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:48,160
right i win you lose you win i lose okay

74
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,480
yeah and then it has to be

75
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,480
everybody knows exactly the same

76
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,720
information on the board

77
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,360
on the on the game right so

78
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,040
it's not like a

79
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,640
pokemon right so i don't know what's on

80
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,640
your hand you don't know what's on my

81
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,680
hand but on the chest everybody knows

82
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,400
what's

83
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,640
yeah

84
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,440
share the same information exactly the

85
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,920
same

86
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,120
like number number hovering in the state

87
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,519
is the number

88
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,760
and who's playing next right

89
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,640
okay so today we just do a little bit

90
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,000
review and using these

91
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,280
these uh

92
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,519
five okay these five terminologies to

93
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,599
describe the tic-tac-toe okay

94
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:32,680
the detector first of all for the start

95
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:32,680
state what's the title star state

96
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,879
so how do we describe a secret top

97
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,239
i mean how do we describe a detector

98
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,040
um

99
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,519
so what's the top uh square

100
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,560
how many squares

101
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,959
okay so a t-tech sauce okay

102
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,439
so nice square three by three so we can

103
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,439
describe a title by a three by three

104
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,120
array right and then who's next who's

105
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,040
gonna play next uh so we have two

106
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,720
players yeah the first one we call the

107
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,480
agent and the other one is called

108
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,760
opponent right

109
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,879
yeah

110
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,239
okay so the state will be the

111
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,720
at the beginning

112
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,959
so at the beginning will be the empty so

113
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:16,079
we we can put a zero okay so we if we

114
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,639
put a zero it means it's empty it's not

115
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,359
occupied yet but

116
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,280
that would be confusing because

117
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:27,280
because

118
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:29,120
that's that's good but how do you put um

119
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,520
yeah i understand your point so let's

120
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,600
let's just use this here number zero two

121
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,880
means that not occupied not occupied

122
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,800
it's empty

123
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,960
zero with uh

124
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,800
that's in it like

125
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,040
yeah yeah that's that's okay that we

126
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,720
have many ways to describe it but if we

127
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,639
it's across

128
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,720
okay so let's say if we use one because

129
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,360
look usually we use the plus one to do

130
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,320
this agent an opponent we use the minus

131
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,560
one okay yeah because look remember y is

132
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,440
plus one minus one

133
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:02,080
we have this that we return the

134
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,080
infinity

135
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,120
if agent wins and if opponent wins we

136
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,919
return

137
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,479
minus infinity okay so look zlo means

138
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:15,440
the not occupied one means the agent

139
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:18,880
occupied yeah this is agent

140
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:22,080
yeah minus one means the opponent okay

141
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,919
of course as you said we can use them

142
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,360
just the character string yeah you if

143
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,479
you say okay

144
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,120
empty

145
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:32,160
is empty and then you put x

146
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:35,039
or color o this is also okay okay but we

147
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,840
use these just to make it simpler when

148
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,280
we want to calculate like

149
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,840
utility make sense

150
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,479
yeah okay so start staying

151
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:47,280
start date okay so let's just quickly

152
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:52,520
implement this okay class

153
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,520
tick tap tap okay ttt okay object

154
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:57,680
[Music]

155
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,080
this is the construction uh constructor

156
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,960
constructor is called when the object

157
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,120
when a tdt class initially is an object

158
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,600
okay it's a constructor what constructor

159
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,600
means c-o-n-s-t-r-u-c-d-o-r

160
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,199
field stuff yeah it's like look with

161
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,440
object templates

162
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,160
class we talk about this object-oriented

163
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,560
programming class

164
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,560
class is the object template

165
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,800
class is object template and we use the

166
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,800
object template to create objects so

167
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,319
when we create the object this init

168
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,919
function will be called

169
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,960
right so let's say class person class

170
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,960
human

171
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:38,560
object undefined in it and then we can

172
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,440
say eric equals

173
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,800
person

174
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,080
yeah and then

175
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,319
when we use the object template person

176
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,280
to create an object this function will

177
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,400
be called

178
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,639
so at the beginning

179
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,039
with these uh

180
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,880
this chord we we don't need uh we don't

181
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:57,039
actually need to pass any parameters

182
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,960
because these three by three this

183
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,520
tic-tac-top game is

184
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,840
it's a deterministic right it's there i

185
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,400
mean we know we all know what is a

186
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,919
detective game it's three by three

187
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,720
and then only

188
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:13,759
only the cross and centers so at the

189
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:17,280
beginning so we define a cell

190
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,720
let's say what do we want to call it

191
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,400
great

192
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,479
squares

193
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,520
square squares okay so let's call it

194
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,880
squares

195
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,080
my t-square squares okay squares at the

196
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,199
beginning

197
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,360
zero

198
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,880
times three

199
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,319
and then four

200
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,319
underscore in range

201
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,800
okay so look we define a two dimensional

202
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,599
two dimensional array right

203
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,639
zero at the beginning we initialize the

204
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:50,639
squares to zero three rows

205
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,560
each one has three columns

206
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,280
and three elements three rows three

207
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:58,479
columns okay let's now be okay and then

208
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:01,759
we need to define uh

209
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:04,080
what uh define the star state okay star

210
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,080
state

211
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:08,879
[Music]

212
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:13,120
there so actually this would just

213
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,120
written a tatter attacker

214
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,280
is immutable array list yeah what's

215
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,960
immutable

216
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,680
you can choose it okay so return the

217
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,839
table first one is the player let's say

218
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,360
plus one is agent and then we want to

219
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,959
return a

220
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,640
state all right we cannot stay so

221
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,560
basically we want to return we don't

222
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,880
return this thing so i'm just going to

223
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,959
copy these here okay

224
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,120
okay so now start date we have started

225
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:51,519
we have implement start right and then

226
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,880
define we have uh

227
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,680
what do we have

228
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:58,880
we have what is end

229
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:01,760
so how do we how do we

230
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,040
how do we uh implement this extent is

231
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,800
end

232
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,800
how do we check if a game has ended

233
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:13,799
[Music]

234
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,680
okay so first of all we decouple the

235
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,240
state into player because this is a

236
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,200
couple yeah for the topper the player

237
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,160
and

238
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,240
and and uh actually okay so we know we

239
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,440
want to check what we want to check if

240
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,399
there are

241
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,740
what

242
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,920
if all

243
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:34,720
[Music]

244
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,399
right

245
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,880
that's right that's right yeah okay so

246
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,120
we want to find out if there are nine

247
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,959
all the squares are filled right so so

248
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,279
so we can say how how do we check it

249
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,800
okay so we can say look

250
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,279
i'm not going to write here okay it will

251
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,519
be too much

252
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,200
too much code here so we one easy way we

253
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,160
can just prove first because only three

254
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,760
times a week so we can say return

255
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:01,279
s zero

256
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:03,120
equals s zero zero

257
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:06,800
right come on

258
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:10,880
so first of all we want to check it out

259
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:12,800
first of all we want to check if all the

260
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,800
all the

261
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,839
squares are occupied so we want to check

262
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,800
if all the squares are occupied so which

263
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,920
one it

264
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,480
yeah

265
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,320
so one way we can do it is because look

266
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,279
we're using one and minus one let's

267
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:30,160
let's accumulate let's accumulate all

268
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:33,519
the values absolute values of the

269
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:35,440
of of the square so if we if the squares

270
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,920
are fully occupied the value should be

271
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,120
equals to what which number

272
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,959
uh

273
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,120
absolute value so i only just

274
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:45,360
nine where that so that's that's right

275
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,839
so first of all i want to

276
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,000
get the value so i can say okay so the

277
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:53,200
value sum

278
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,200
i can say some sum

279
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,680
a b x

280
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,240
x

281
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,240
for

282
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:01,519
uh

283
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,839
x

284
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,839
in

285
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,800
so so i want to sum up each one so sum

286
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,839
up ah okay so let's say and then i need

287
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,260
to do this

288
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,839
sum uh

289
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:19,040
[Music]

290
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,320
sum x for x in r for

291
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,240
r in

292
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,800
this s okay

293
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,519
for i in s and for x now i want to sum

294
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,720
it

295
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:30,000
some days

296
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:32,720
some days needs to be if if if this is

297
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,839
nine then we depend two right obviously

298
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,600
okay

299
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,360
yeah we can do

300
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,519
right so we want to sum up all the

301
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,440
elements the absolute value we put

302
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,680
absolute value here because

303
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,720
we have minus one and we want to count

304
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:50,160
how many how many uh slots are occupied

305
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:53,120
so if the squares are four then all

306
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:56,480
of the number will be nine okay and now

307
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:59,120
if not and i can say i can check what if

308
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:02,399
so i have to say look out for

309
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,200
r in range three yeah we want to check

310
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,000
each

311
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,560
row

312
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,720
right each three rows

313
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,720
if

314
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,720
if

315
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:17,680
[Music]

316
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:21,760
so we go through each row and then if

317
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:24,800
if r0 equals r1

318
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:27,360
equals r2 okay so we want we just check

319
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,680
each element in each row

320
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,760
and then return to all right this this

321
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,680
is checking over and then we also need

322
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,160
to check the columns yeah check the

323
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,120
column remember we talked about how to

324
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,000
how to

325
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,800
transpose a metric yeah using the zip

326
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,480
function so we can just ship it yeah we

327
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,399
can say four

328
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,760
for r in

329
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,800
g

330
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:53,519
star s right so we ship it we transpose

331
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,680
it transparency and i this is the same

332
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,839
if we just copy here

333
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,320
and and then for how many diagonals we

334
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,320
need to check

335
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,680
two so we just we just follow that needs

336
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:10,000
to check if r0

337
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:14,880
if let's still 0 equals s11 equals s22

338
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:18,320
or if s02 equals s11 equals s

339
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,360
s2 0 land return 2 okay this is its n

340
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,800
okay

341
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,600
an action

342
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:26,399
how do we define the action

343
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,440
action action taking a state

344
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,320
uh

345
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,320
taking a state

346
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,720
taking the action so how do we take

347
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,880
action

348
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,600
so what's the action

349
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:42,480
action describes that what's the next

350
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,720
move for a player right yeah

351
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,639
so look action so as

352
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,480
first of all i need to decouple the

353
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:53,279
state player s equals state

354
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,760
yeah so now look i just need to do what

355
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:58,480
player my current player is player so

356
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:01,440
the next player is minus player yeah we

357
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,519
we negative we get the sign so currently

358
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,360
is the agent and that's right opponent

359
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,600
if the current player is opponent the

360
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,720
next agent will be the next player of

361
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,959
the agent

362
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,120
but the thing is that the action will be

363
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,399
the all

364
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,480
uh

365
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,800
unoccupied sloths right if it's an

366
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,120
occupy i can i can i can put a cross or

367
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,160
circle there right am right yeah

368
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,519
you can do

369
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,399
your team

370
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:28,240
yeah yeah i know for example now kind of

371
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:32,079
kind of stay is asian and the next one

372
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:34,079
is opponent so so but

373
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,120
for both agent and

374
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,720
opponent

375
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,399
they are also looking like they can

376
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,639
place

377
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:44,240
they can place either the

378
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:46,639
cross or circle in the unoccupied slot

379
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,480
right so so first of all i need to and

380
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,720
uh put in the

381
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,920
answer okay this is the list and i need

382
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,120
to go through

383
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:58,320
four okay i'm going to write it here for

384
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:01,519
for for r in registry for column

385
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:05,279
inventory if src

386
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:07,920
equal equals zero then we can append rc

387
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:10,959
okay we can see this is action

388
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,720
okay this is actually and what else star

389
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:15,120
stay is and

390
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,079
action and utility okay utility so how

391
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,360
do we

392
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:20,399
implement utility function utility only

393
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,880
uh

394
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,560
only applies to end game okay and state

395
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,839
so we first of all

396
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,839
we first of all need to

397
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:34,800
apparently take the state parameters and

398
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,480
we need to decouple it yeah so player

399
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:40,240
everybody come on

400
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:43,199
player s equals stay become a another

401
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,040
state so i want to assure this state is

402
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,759
ended so a third

403
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,720
a

404
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,320
cell

405
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,519
dot is n

406
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,720
this end s okay so now the game has to

407
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,800
be ended

408
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,720
right so it's empty now

409
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:00,160
so like utility

410
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:03,040
so if solar utility so so okay so this

411
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:05,680
this one if it's ended so now i need i

412
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,839
also need to

413
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,399
so

414
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:11,279
for

415
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:14,399
we also need a function to tell us who

416
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:15,759
wins right who wins right so this

417
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,320
function

418
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,079
so so the logic will be similar here so

419
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,800
you're looking for maybe we can reset a

420
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:24,959
little a little bit is n it's n

421
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,639
instead of return true or false we we

422
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:29,920
also return a number

423
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:32,240
even at zero it means a draw if it's one

424
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:37,560
it means the agent one if it's minus one

425
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,560
autonomy so this is basically yeah

426
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,720
so so basically we're going to use this

427
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:44,639
bit of code logic here this is a utility

428
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,720
function and the successor is actually

429
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,600
very genetic

430
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,440
generic

431
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,839
template okay successor

432
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,839
tear

433
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,120
takes a state

434
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,279
and takes a action and it just

435
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,920
it just returns the next state okay so

436
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:06,160
then player

437
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,360
we also need to decouple the state

438
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,000
and then

439
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:12,559
this retains the action yeah this uh

440
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,360
this is the action action would be

441
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,360
action would be

442
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,880
that what the action will be the the

443
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:22,559
pixel which coordinate which slots

444
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,199
you're going to place okay so then we

445
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:27,760
can just pretend we just say

446
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,520
this action action

447
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,200
0

448
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,240
and

449
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,240
action one

450
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,760
equal equal what equals to

451
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,240
play to play

452
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,160
current player okay column play and then

453
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,200
return

454
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:49,280
minus play player okay because current

455
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,000
player is agent the next one is minus

456
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,960
three and then we turn the new state

457
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,799
right

458
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,360
okay

459
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:59,600
so now in this case we just define the

460
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,559
take that token using these uh

461
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,480
side

462
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:05,840
terminologies the star stage is and

463
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,120
action

464
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:10,240
action

465
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,760
utility success success okay

466
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,559
yeah

467
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:17,760
any questions so far any questions

468
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,559
any questions too much noise

469
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,640
okay

470
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:22,400
okay come on yeah

471
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:26,160
okay that will be it for today

472
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,160
bye bye bye bye bye

473
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,720
okay okay you
