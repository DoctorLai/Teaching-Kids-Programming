1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,439
hello hello eric are you all right yes

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,759
yes

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,960
okay so the link list yeah we talked

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,840
about the news yesterday

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,679
english singular english what's simply

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,679
you didn't enjoy that last time

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,240
yeah simply linked list what does it

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,340
mean right now yeah yeah oh

9
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,720
thankfully what's single i mean

10
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:23,039
[Music]

11
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,400
only one straight line only one

12
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,039
direction they're pointing only

13
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,160
direction

14
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:31,119
and what's the opposite of thing

15
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,119
double double

16
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,600
doubling that means that it could be

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,239
pointing to next and pointing to

18
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,520
backwards

19
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,280
you'll be something like that but we are

20
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,000
talking about let's think

21
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,440
it's only point okay so each no three no

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,719
no not just two

23
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:50,480
so only the synthesis would be a node

24
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:53,360
contains a value and then point a link

25
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,039
points to another node yeah so it knows

26
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,320
means to another node

27
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:01,520
so here this is okay so this is a single

28
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,719
node and i want you to change it to so

29
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,920
let each node

30
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:08,880
points to points to

31
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,159
the value number of nodes ahead so for

32
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,760
number two

33
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:17,360
so meaning jumps to two jumps two

34
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,159
one two yeah so the two should be points

35
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,320
to

36
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,400
four here now and i don't care about the

37
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,920
one and then four

38
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,720
through four jump but it doesn't have

39
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,479
enough force knows then

40
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,840
because they're only one node left so

41
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:33,360
you you you

42
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,079
just needs to needs to jump points to

43
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,600
noon

44
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:41,840
to none okay another example like

45
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,840
one two

46
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:49,730
[Music]

47
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,479
so what was one one jumps to the here so

48
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,759
let's hear two

49
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,560
two jumps one two right so this these

50
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,799
will be

51
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,560
you have to start from the beginning one

52
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,920
one one yeah okay

53
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,600
yes start from the beginning so the

54
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,239
first note is always the no we don't

55
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,319
want to keep

56
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,800
then you can go one direction yeah one

57
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:12,800
direction

58
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,680
we have at foreign now there but for

59
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,200
this this is the now we

60
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:32,400
we start the head but not the head

61
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,360
so first of all we want to find out we

62
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,239
want to jump

63
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,360
the value the number of values in the

64
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,080
value

65
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,000
uh notes ahead we can do it right right

66
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,200
we can do it yeah

67
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,519
define let's say jump

68
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,519
and then note okay first of all if

69
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,239
there's the only one now what happened

70
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,200
if it's not not empty if it's empty what

71
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,360
happened

72
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,720
we just returned yeah he did nothing

73
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,680
baby pretend no

74
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,680
no no no right because it's empty then

75
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:06,319
there's no need to continue right

76
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:08,720
and then now look head equals no i

77
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,680
so here this is the note right i don't

78
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,840
care how many

79
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,000
i want to jump this is head here i

80
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,159
config i want to jump to the value of

81
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,959
notes so how can i do it i do a work for

82
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:23,599
loop right yeah

83
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:28,239
four four in range

84
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:30,720
when what red one

85
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:33,120
the head very well because this is the

86
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:36,080
value we want to jump right up like two

87
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,080
to head of value

88
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:42,400
all right yes and

89
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,840
how can we jump how can we jump head how

90
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,840
can we jump to the next half equal as

91
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,840
well

92
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:54,030
[Music]

93
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,560
have enough notes what happened if i

94
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,680
already reached the end

95
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,680
no it's not head what happened if here

96
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,879
not head or weapon

97
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,239
and pointing the nail thingy no okay i

98
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,200
can just break yeah

99
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,599
break right because look because you

100
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,280
just

101
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,840
break because if you don't break it what

102
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,359
happened the next iteration happens and

103
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,360
you return something

104
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:24,720
okay so what why what are we doing here

105
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,320
we are finding the head

106
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:32,639
the points to the next one so no right

107
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:37,040
now next equals

108
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,040
what jump

109
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:43,120
jump jump what can you feel the blank

110
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,120
and return

111
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,280
jump here i divide it jump i want to

112
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:59,199
because it will jump away

113
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:03,199
why got it

114
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:06,160
come on so what does this mean here

115
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,400
after this point this head will be the

116
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,400
head

117
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,720
for example here right here for example

118
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,759
if we

119
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:26,400
look hey there you go right

120
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,199
and i want to jump jump head i want to

121
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,000
jump jump jump

122
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,919
this is a head and i need to set no the

123
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,880
next equals head right

124
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,800
the jump head i need to keep jumping

125
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,960
because here is because

126
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,960
okay

127
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,670
[Music]

128
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:56,479
which part is the question um

129
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:59,360
yeah jump because yeah jump here got it

130
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,240
no yeah whoa does it make sense all

131
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,759
right

132
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:07,199
um okay i'm going to erase this

133
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:10,240
okay come on come on that's impossible

134
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:13,280
right come on this is a note

135
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,680
and then i'm here and i want to

136
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,360
i want to do what head is here head here

137
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,080
i want to find

138
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,479
head head i want to head i have to jump

139
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,520
to

140
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:27,120
this point and then i need to set it to

141
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:29,919
here can you can do it can you do it um

142
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,120
can you do it no no you need to write

143
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,720
the four loop first

144
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:37,199
four but i can write right there

145
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,319
break it only works in the for loop yeah

146
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:42,240
for

147
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:45,919
for anything for well yeah

148
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,759
for come on forward something

149
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,800
yeah something there i understood

150
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,800
something in range

151
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,000
this pen doesn't look like a pen that's

152
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,000
right

153
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,240
no no yeah i don't really

154
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,319
know the value it doesn't matter because

155
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,919
head equals no idea at this point has a

156
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,880
value here

157
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,599
has a value we want to jump we want to

158
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,919
jump

159
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,960
make the head jump head of value a

160
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,039
number of times

161
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:30,800
and then how can we jump how can we move

162
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:33,360
the head the number of times

163
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,520
okay and in the middle what if they are

164
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,319
if they are not enough head or nose

165
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,039
if head becomes the end what happens if

166
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:45,840
your head

167
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:45,840
reaches yeah and how can you okay

168
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:57,239
[Music]

169
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,350
right it reaches the end and then what

170
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,919
you will not have a lot

171
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:09,039
[Music]

172
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:12,879
