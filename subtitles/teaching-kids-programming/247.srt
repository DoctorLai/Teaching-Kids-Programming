1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,880
hello today uh we talk about a math

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,720
problem okay

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:12,639
yeah okay so given that

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:14,880
and people are people these people okay

5
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,039
there are lots of people he's standing

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,359
in the line yeah a lot of people i'm

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,720
wrong with that a lot

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:25,840
hey okay so all right ryan listen to me

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,199
yes we are they are end people okay look

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,160
at their own people

11
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,599
and people and are you are standing

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,440
somewhere but you're not sure

13
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,280
which position you are in right so you

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:40,320
could be here and keep it here

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:43,520
right but you know you know there are

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,200
eight people in front of you yeah there

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,760
are eight people in front

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,360
you and b people at least eight people

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,440
in front of you

20
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,120
at least eight people in front of you

21
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,239
suppose you are here right you are here

22
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,000
you are here

23
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,640
so there are at least eight people in

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,719
front of

25
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,320
uh at least eight people in front of you

26
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,840
and here

27
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,159
you and most and most big people

28
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,520
at the back of you okay here is frank

29
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,320
here is from

30
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,320
and he's back

31
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,600
so look you're facing this way yeah so

32
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,159
there there are

33
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,520
at least eight people in front of you

34
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,080
and and most

35
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,119
b people at the back of you i give an

36
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,880
example right

37
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,320
so that if there are three people yeah n

38
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,600
equals three

39
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,759
and if i say in these you

40
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,720
you're not sure where position you are

41
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,880
but you know

42
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,280
at least one people in front of you and

43
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,000
one people at the back

44
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,520
yeah one one people one person one

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,759
person at the back of you so

46
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,640
how many possible petition can you be in

47
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,520
this game

48
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,439
where why is one middle yeah it's in the

49
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,360
middle because look here at one people

50
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,119
at least one people in front of you and

51
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,640
most when people are at the back of you

52
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,040
can it be here

53
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,560
no because there's two in the front and

54
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,600
none of them

55
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,920
wait wait wait look yeah you can be here

56
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,079
look

57
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,920
you say at least one people in front of

58
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,319
you right but there are two people so at

59
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,720
least

60
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:11,440
one two three there's one there isn't

61
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,760
any

62
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,440
that's okay atmosphere so it could be

63
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,160
here as well

64
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,360
so there are two two right that's what

65
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,080
i'm saying at least

66
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,400
at least two people at least one how

67
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,239
about

68
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:29,599
the back none zero is smaller than b

69
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:32,800
right what's b b one people a

70
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:35,760
a equals one b equals one so

71
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,280
can it be here no at least one because

72
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,480
we've got nothing so this

73
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:43,360
condition does not certify okay okay

74
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,840
so yeah what does it make sense it could

75
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,040
be this one or this one right

76
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,239
yeah i know and then all you need to do

77
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,560
is look in front of you

78
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,080
if if there is a person in front of you

79
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,680
he says

80
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,760
yeah yeah so how can we solve this

81
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,319
problem okay so we're just

82
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,879
using three four things how do we prove

83
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,000
first

84
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:07,440
i check in each one okay so like okay

85
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,800
on my first one okay turn me around ryan

86
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:14,000
okay and then and then okay

87
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:18,239
i haven't found only okay is it

88
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,280
is it it from the front is it smaller

89
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,200
than one

90
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,560
yeah so we just checking right look we

91
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,200
can check if we're here right

92
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,480
yeah in here here so this is the way we

93
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,720
professing we check

94
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,480
each possible location and we check if

95
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,519
we satisfy these two conditions

96
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,560
at least a in front of you and at least

97
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:41,040
at most b at the back of you right

98
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:45,840
okay so so and if we satisfied

99
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:50,159
we increment the answer okay so define

100
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:52,239
three parameters and a b what's missing

101
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,760
okay now is the partition all right

102
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,360
let's say position is i

103
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,360
answer answer is

104
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:04,400
equal zero okay so now yeah okay

105
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:07,519
and now we need to check look if if

106
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,640
at most b at the back right so i needs

107
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,840
to be smaller than b

108
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,879
equal b right look why oh look look

109
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:18,160
here this is i so

110
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:20,959
b yeah needs to smoke this i

111
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,919
needs to small equal than b am right

112
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,560
yeah

113
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:24,560
could it be b

114
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:31,520
well not really

115
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:35,199
look if and most and most

116
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,199
yes and most right because

117
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:42,560
so look look there are np

118
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,639
and here is i so how many of these here

119
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,840
are here

120
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,320
and here is n here is i and how big is

121
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,680
this

122
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:54,880
um n minus i

123
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:58,320
and minus i right yeah you cut it

124
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:01,199
n minus i and elite and these right

125
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,759
at least and minus i plus one actually

126
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,880
right

127
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:07,919
and minus i plus one

128
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:11,039
at least bigger equal

129
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:14,240
than a right right okay

130
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,199
yeah and if i remove this equal so i can

131
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,479
remove this

132
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:21,520
one right so n minus i bigger than a

133
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,000
is e is the same as m minus a bigger

134
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,039
than i

135
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,240
am right yeah

136
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:32,320
and then y i is smaller than n minus

137
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:35,680
a and if this is these two conditions

138
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:38,000
mean satisfy what we do answers what

139
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,240
plus equals one and what happened to the

140
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,240
eye

141
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,639
we start from left to the right so what

142
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,639
happens

143
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,759
okay so look check what are we doing

144
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,919
here

145
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,919
look at this is very important the term

146
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:01,520
complexity is what

147
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,520
and space convexity

148
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:07,759
then look i look i is yellow

149
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,720
i want to check if it's yellow look if i

150
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,960
don't check this

151
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:15,360
why n is i is zero y i smaller than b

152
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,400
and the plus equals one i plus equals

153
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,639
one so

154
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:22,880
what's answer in this case

155
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,319
look if i don't don't if i don't

156
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,000
consider this bit

157
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,520
so what's what's what does this doing

158
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,840
why i smaller than b

159
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,520
answer plus equals one i plus equals one

160
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,600
can we calculate the value of

161
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:37,600
i of answer

162
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,600
yes look i is zero every time you

163
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,520
increment one until it reaches b

164
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,880
every time you increment i answer will

165
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,880
equal one so what's the answer

166
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,199
what's the answer what's the value of

167
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:52,720
answer when this loop

168
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:55,280
breaks look i

169
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,400
start from zero zero one two yeah until

170
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,599
b right

171
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,039
and each time i increment one answer

172
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,960
also increment one right

173
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:06,080
yes so what's the value of our answer

174
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:08,280
when the i is equals to b

175
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,840
smaller or equals to b um

176
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,960
[Music]

177
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:16,880
b plus one yeah because yeah yeah b plus

178
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,720
another i chose b smaller than b right

179
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,400
now b plus one because star from zero do

180
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,800
you have one okay here i

181
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,759
added one more look i added one more

182
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,240
condition here

183
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,960
all right look y i is smaller than n

184
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,720
minus a

185
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,160
so if i don't look at this bit if i

186
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,960
don't i look at this speed

187
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,479
i will increment how many times and

188
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,360
minus a right

189
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,919
and answer would be n minus a right yeah

190
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,960
so if

191
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:45,520
i to please two condition and put an n

192
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:49,440
so what's the value of answer

193
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:52,560
b b and a

194
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:55,039
smaller or bigger of these b

195
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,599
and n minus a look i is smaller than b

196
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,919
and i

197
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,680
is smaller than n minus a so what does

198
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:03,360
it mean i is smaller than 100

199
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:06,720
i is smaller than a thousand so what

200
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,400
i smaller than b yeah i explained 100 so

201
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,599
we want to know which one is smaller

202
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,680
right

203
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:14,879
yeah so the answer would be the smaller

204
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,879
value of what

205
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,440
smaller value of one b plus one because

206
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,240
zero

207
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,639
will be all and this right so can you

208
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:28,240
write it yeah do you understand now

209
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:32,399
all right do you understand

210
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:35,919
so all these can be improved

211
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:39,839
into one single line return

212
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:41,760
with our minimum of what two values

213
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,800
minimum of a and b

214
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:47,040
sorry minimum

215
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,040
one

216
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:55,440
what is this doing here b b

217
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:58,640
b plus one right and a

218
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:01,600
this is ah this is i n smaller n minus

219
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,000
a so what's the value what what do we

220
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,480
say

221
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,600
look i smaller than 100 and i smaller

222
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,080
than a thousand

223
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,440
so what's this mean y i is smaller than

224
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,200
which condition will be

225
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:15,760
will be yeah smaller one right

226
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,680
so when i increment how many times

227
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,800
answer increment how many times

228
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,800
so look this when i is

229
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,000
when b is smaller the answer will

230
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:28,240
increment b plus

231
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,640
1 times when n minus a is smaller

232
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,760
because this is equal smaller not equal

233
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,959
so your increment

234
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:38,000
and minus a times right

235
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:41,680
so what's your happen here n

236
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,240
minus a where down does it make sense

237
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,720
correct what's the time complexity of

238
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,959
this one

239
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,959
this is the same as this one which one

240
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:52,399
is better

241
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:54,720
i like the bottom one

242
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:57,519
yeah this is quicker and what's the

243
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,519
sound complexity

244
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:00,789
[Music]

245
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,760
come on my smartest one yeah because no

246
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,600
matter how big is

247
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,880
n we can just directly calculate the

248
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,240
answer right

249
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,560
does it make sense eric do you

250
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:16,480
understand why we can transform this

251
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:19,839
from o n to a one how can we improve it

252
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:23,200
do you understand look if b is a

253
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:26,480
10 n minus a is a hundred

254
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:29,200
so if it's same as y i smaller than 10

255
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,800
and i smaller than 100 i will be

256
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,600
increment one so which condition would

257
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,839
be me

258
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:39,360
will will be break

259
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:41,279
i increment from zero to one two three

260
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,160
four five which number you will hit

261
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:47,839
first why i smaller than ten and why i

262
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,839
smaller than hundred

263
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,240
the smaller one right yeah the smaller

264
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,120
one so

265
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,839
when it hits the 10 answer will be 11

266
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,760
right

267
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,800
got it all right if this is a hundred

268
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,880
and this is ten

269
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:07,600
so so these will be hit first right

270
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,079
right okay look every time we increment

271
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,279
i

272
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:13,519
we include my answer got it so basically

273
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,480
we want to find out how many iterations

274
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,320
this book does

275
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:20,640
right right so it's the answer of

276
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,480
because look is i smaller than one

277
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,959
something and i smaller than another

278
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,720
thing

279
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:27,120
so we want to find out the minimum

280
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,320
iteration minimum number of these two

281
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,240
values right

282
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,399
and this is the number of times i

283
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,839
iterate got it

284
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:39,279
i iterate and that's the answer because

285
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:41,440
answer increment as i increment e plus

286
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:44,800
one because i smaller or equal b

287
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:47,279
when when this loop exists the i

288
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,240
answer will be increment i plus 1 b plus

289
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,200
1 times

290
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,560
i smaller than n minus a when i equals a

291
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,000
minus a you'll be

292
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:58,000
iterated and minus a times right the

293
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,839
time complexity of one because

294
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,279
mathematics no matter how big is this

295
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,480
okay okay so

296
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:05,360
give me one answer that's it give me one

297
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,399
answer

298
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:11,839
okay you write it for me okay come on

299
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,839
which one

300
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:28,800
yeah doesn't make sense

301
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,720
okay in one sentence can you describe me

302
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:34,480
what have you learned today

303
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,480
hi what's the problem today

304
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:40,880
what's the problem today

305
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,800
if you want to tell mommy if you want to

306
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,639
ask mommy

307
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,160
and can you describe me you don't need

308
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,440
to tell me the solution just tell me

309
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,680
what's the problem

310
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,200
the problem is there's not enough people

311
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,240
and you don't know where you are

312
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,959
yeah there aren't people yeah but you

313
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:00,079
know what you know is what

314
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:02,560
and most b people

315
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,279
at the back right and eight people in

316
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,959
the front

317
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:10,240
at least eight people in the front right

318
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:12,560
and then you want to know how long

319
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,680
how many of possibilities you can be

320
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:20,240
right okay

321
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:25,519
yeah okay you can tell mommy that's bye

322
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,519
okay that's it
