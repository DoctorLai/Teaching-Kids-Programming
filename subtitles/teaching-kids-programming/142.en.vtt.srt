so each people
can only be one

74
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:38,400
can only be one
 

75
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,109
can only be one
each people can only complete one task

76
00:01:41,109 --> 00:01:41,119
each people can only complete one task
 

77
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:41,749
each people can only complete one task
at most

78
00:01:41,749 --> 00:01:41,759
at most
 

79
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,670
at most
right when you complete we only pick a

80
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:43,680
right when you complete we only pick a
 

81
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,030
right when you complete we only pick a
task in complete yeah

82
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:45,040
task in complete yeah
 

83
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,190
task in complete yeah
all right he cannot he could for example

84
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:47,200
all right he cannot he could for example
 

85
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,270
all right he cannot he could for example
if the six can complete

86
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:49,280
if the six can complete
 

87
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,270
if the six can complete
the task of three five but cannot

88
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:51,280
the task of three five but cannot
 

89
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,069
the task of three five but cannot
compete with nine after six is the

90
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:54,079
compete with nine after six is the
 

91
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:54,950
compete with nine after six is the
strength yeah

92
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:54,960
strength yeah
 

93
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,709
strength yeah
can this is the strength needed to

94
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:56,719
can this is the strength needed to
 

95
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:57,990
can this is the strength needed to
complete the task right

96
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:58,000
complete the task right
 

97
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,550
complete the task right
can you do that one six and four yes

98
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:00,560
can you do that one six and four yes
 

99
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,990
can you do that one six and four yes
because yes

100
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:02,000
because yes
 

101
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,069
because yes
but one can't do anything that's right

102
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:04,079
but one can't do anything that's right
 

103
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,910
but one can't do anything that's right
yeah so that i can

104
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:05,920
yeah so that i can
 

105
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,070
yeah so that i can
how about if it's the same it's the same

106
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:08,080
how about if it's the same it's the same
 

107
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,270
how about if it's the same it's the same
yes yes four can

108
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:09,280
yes yes four can
 

109
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,150
yes yes four can
it just has to be bigger or equal yeah

110
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:12,160
it just has to be bigger or equal yeah
 

111
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,630
it just has to be bigger or equal yeah
okay

112
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:14,640

 

113
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,670

okay so the problem is uh

114
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:17,680
okay so the problem is uh
 

115
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,910
okay so the problem is uh
how many tasks maximum can be completed

116
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:21,920
how many tasks maximum can be completed
 

117
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,830
how many tasks maximum can be completed
okay which one can be

118
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:23,840
okay which one can be
 

119
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,949
okay which one can be
so for example like three i think

120
00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:26,959
so for example like three i think
 

121
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,710
so for example like three i think
each people can only complete one okay

122
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:28,720
each people can only complete one okay
 

123
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,589
each people can only complete one okay
look look look so in this case

124
00:02:31,589 --> 00:02:31,599
look look look so in this case
 

125
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,990
look look look so in this case
let's say three can be complete with

126
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:34,000
let's say three can be complete with
 

127
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,190
let's say three can be complete with
three yeah

128
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:35,200
three yeah
 

129
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,390
three yeah
okay so i i put it yeah

130
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:38,400
okay so i i put it yeah
 

131
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,430
okay so i i put it yeah
and four can be completed by

132
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:41,440
and four can be completed by
 

133
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,229
and four can be completed by
four yeah and five can be compared to

134
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:44,239
four yeah and five can be compared to
 

135
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:45,910
four yeah and five can be compared to
six yeah that's it yeah

136
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:45,920
six yeah that's it yeah
 

137
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,869
six yeah that's it yeah
all right but the thing is that for

138
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:48,879
all right but the thing is that for
 

139
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,110
all right but the thing is that for
example like uh

140
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:51,120
example like uh
 

141
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,229
example like uh
uh look if

142
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:54,239
uh look if
 

143
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,509
uh look if
if you look look if you please

144
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:57,519
if you look look if you please
 

145
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,790
if you look look if you please
look if you uh the three tasks if you

146
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:00,800
look if you uh the three tasks if you
 

147
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,149
look if you uh the three tasks if you
use the six

148
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:02,159
use the six
 

149
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,910
use the six
right yeah look six can complete with

150
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:05,920
right yeah look six can complete with
 

151
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,110
right yeah look six can complete with
tasks and then five five

152
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:09,120
tasks and then five five
 

153
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,430
tasks and then five five
like you you can't find anything that

154
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:11,440
like you you can't find anything that
 

155
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,270
like you you can't find anything that
can compete with five right and you can

156
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:13,280
can compete with five right and you can
 

157
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,790
can compete with five right and you can
completely fall

158
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:14,800
completely fall
 

159
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,550
completely fall
right all right so it doesn't make sense

160
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:18,560
right all right so it doesn't make sense
 

161
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,229
right all right so it doesn't make sense
so we want to find the maxima in this

162
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:20,239
so we want to find the maxima in this
 

163
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,149
so we want to find the maxima in this
case only three

164
00:03:22,149 --> 00:03:22,159
case only three
 

165
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,270
case only three
let's see but if we if we let that six

166
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:25,280
let's see but if we if we let that six
 

167
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,229
let's see but if we if we let that six
hundred the class three then we can't

168
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:28,239
hundred the class three then we can't
 

169
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:28,949
hundred the class three then we can't
find any

170
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:28,959
find any
 

171
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,430
find any
people to kinda to start flying right

172
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:31,440
people to kinda to start flying right
 

173
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,229
people to kinda to start flying right
because see

174
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:32,239
because see
 

175
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,670
because see
six is used all right doesn't make sense

176
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:35,680
six is used all right doesn't make sense
 

177
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,309
six is used all right doesn't make sense
okay so how can we do this what's your

178
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:38,319
okay so how can we do this what's your
 

179
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,630
okay so how can we do this what's your
strategy what's your strategy

180
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:40,640
strategy what's your strategy
 

181
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,830
strategy what's your strategy
what's your strategy

182
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:43,840

 

183
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,390

so if a task can be completed if either

184
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:46,400
so if a task can be completed if either
 

185
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,750
so if a task can be completed if either
task

186
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:47,760
task
 

187
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,030
task
com company say let's see let's say if

188
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:51,040
com company say let's see let's say if
 

189
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,470
com company say let's see let's say if
class 3 can be completed by

190
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:54,480
class 3 can be completed by
 

191
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,869
class 3 can be completed by
people three and four which one you

192
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:56,879
people three and four which one you
 

193
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:57,589
people three and four which one you
think

194
00:03:57,589 --> 00:03:57,599
think
 

195
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:05,429
think
should pick the task three or four

196
00:04:05,429 --> 00:04:05,439

 

197
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,149

if even the class requires the strength

198
00:04:08,149 --> 00:04:08,159
if even the class requires the strength
 

199
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:08,550
if even the class requires the strength
three

200
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:08,560
three
 

201
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,110
three
and we've got people three and four the

202
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:11,120
and we've got people three and four the
 

203
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,949
and we've got people three and four the
strength with three and four

204
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:12,959
strength with three and four
 

205
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,229
strength with three and four
and and two three four five so which one

206
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:16,239
and and two three four five so which one
 

207
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:17,189
and and two three four five so which one
you think

208
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:17,199
you think
 

209
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,870
you think
we should let the people say

210
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:20,880
we should let the people say
 

211
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,189
we should let the people say
so it's uh only the target three

212
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:25,199
so it's uh only the target three
 

213
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,110
so it's uh only the target three
yeah so we have a task three and we have

214
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:27,120
yeah so we have a task three and we have
 

215
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,350
yeah so we have a task three and we have
a few people four people who can

216
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:29,360
a few people four people who can
 

217
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,670
a few people four people who can
uh these three people can handle this

218
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:31,680
uh these three people can handle this
 

219
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,030
uh these three people can handle this
but number two right

220
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,040
but number two right
 

221
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,870
but number two right
yeah so which one you think we should

222
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:34,880
yeah so which one you think we should
 

223
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,710
yeah so which one you think we should
pick to to let the

224
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:36,720
pick to to let the
 

225
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,749
pick to to let the
people we can you we can we can assign

226
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:39,759
people we can you we can we can assign
 

227
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:40,390
people we can you we can we can assign
the task

228
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:40,400
the task
 

229
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,030
the task
to three or assign the task 24 outside

230
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:43,040
to three or assign the task 24 outside
 

231
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,189
to three or assign the task 24 outside
half to 5. so which one you think is the

232
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:45,199
half to 5. so which one you think is the
 

233
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,150
half to 5. so which one you think is the
better

234
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:46,160
better
 

235
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,390
better
it's better strategy because the

236
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:50,400
it's better strategy because the
 

237
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,110
it's better strategy because the
very task is three

238
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:55,120
very task is three
 

239
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,590
very task is three
i didn't know it i think it doesn't

240
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:57,600
i didn't know it i think it doesn't
 

241
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,390
i didn't know it i think it doesn't
really matter

242
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:58,400
really matter
 

243
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,550
really matter
okay okay that's a good question let's

244
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:00,560
okay okay that's a good question let's
 

245
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,310
okay okay that's a good question let's
go a point that it doesn't matter in

246
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:02,320
go a point that it doesn't matter in
 

247
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,990
go a point that it doesn't matter in
this case but i'm saying that

248
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:04,000
this case but i'm saying that
 

249
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,830
this case but i'm saying that
there may be a lot of other tasks and

250
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:05,840
there may be a lot of other tasks and
 

251
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,590
there may be a lot of other tasks and
then lots of other people

252
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:09,600

 

253
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,390

okay maybe lots of other tasks like look

254
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:12,400
okay maybe lots of other tasks like look
 

255
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,189
okay maybe lots of other tasks like look
three

256
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:13,199
three
 

257
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,710
three
and then maybe i have uh

258
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:16,720
and then maybe i have uh
 

259
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,790
and then maybe i have uh
four uh i have uh wait wait wait yep

260
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:20,800
four uh i have uh wait wait wait yep
 

261
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,390
four uh i have uh wait wait wait yep
wait wait i have a 10 here and i have uh

262
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:24,400
wait wait i have a 10 here and i have uh
 

263
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,390
wait wait i have a 10 here and i have uh
ten and i have uh

264
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:28,400
ten and i have uh
 

265
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,590
ten and i have uh
not eight seven eight okay eight eight

266
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:31,600
not eight seven eight okay eight eight
 

267
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,670
not eight seven eight okay eight eight
and then i have uh

268
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:33,680
and then i have uh
 

269
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,909
and then i have uh
seven okay

270
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:39,919

 

271
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,550

yeah so look three if i i can add a

272
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:42,560
yeah so look three if i i can add a
 

273
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,430
yeah so look three if i i can add a
three and eight

274
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:43,440
three and eight
 

275
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,550
three and eight
so it's better to let the lowest

276
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:46,560
so it's better to let the lowest
 

277
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,230
so it's better to let the lowest
people who is qualified for the job

278
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:48,240
people who is qualified for the job
 

279
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,790
people who is qualified for the job
right if i never ate

280
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:50,800
right if i never ate
 

281
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,350
right if i never ate
what happened if i then a to under three

282
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:55,360
what happened if i then a to under three
 

283
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,990
what happened if i then a to under three
what happened we don't have we can't

284
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:58,000
what happened we don't have we can't
 

285
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,029
what happened we don't have we can't
handle seven

286
00:05:59,029 --> 00:05:59,039
handle seven
 

287
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,110
handle seven
we can't find the seven so so the thing

288
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:01,120
we can't find the seven so so the thing
 

289
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,270
we can't find the seven so so the thing
is that if a task is three

290
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:03,280
is that if a task is three
 

291
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,710
is that if a task is three
if your task is requires effort strength

292
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:06,720
if your task is requires effort strength
 

293
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,430
if your task is requires effort strength
a we we want to find the smallest

294
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:11,440
a we we want to find the smallest
 

295
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,950
a we we want to find the smallest
people the people with the smallest

296
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:12,960
people the people with the smallest
 

297
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,469
people the people with the smallest
strength that is

298
00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:14,479
strength that is
 

299
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,590
strength that is
qualified to handle a right doesn't make

300
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:17,600
qualified to handle a right doesn't make
 

301
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,309
qualified to handle a right doesn't make
sense so coming back to the question

302
00:06:20,309 --> 00:06:20,319
sense so coming back to the question
 

303
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,590
sense so coming back to the question
three and then three four

304
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:21,600
three and then three four
 

305
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,150
three and then three four
five so three is to qualify because it's

306
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:24,160
five so three is to qualify because it's
 

307
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,270
five so three is to qualify because it's
the lowest

308
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:25,280
the lowest
 

309
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,510
the lowest
smallest number bigger than or equal

310
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:27,520
smallest number bigger than or equal
 

311
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,550
smallest number bigger than or equal
than three right

312
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:28,560
than three right
 

313
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,629
than three right
all right so it's always the optimal

314
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:30,639
all right so it's always the optimal
 

315
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,070
all right so it's always the optimal
strategy liquidity strategy because that

316
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:34,080
strategy liquidity strategy because that
 

317
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,189
strategy liquidity strategy because that
if we let the four because we know the

318
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:37,199
if we let the four because we know the
 

319
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,870
if we let the four because we know the
three can handle this

320
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:38,880
three can handle this
 

321
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,909
three can handle this
and it's the lowest one right if we land

322
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:41,919
and it's the lowest one right if we land
 

323
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,150
and it's the lowest one right if we land
the three hundred then we can have four

324
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:44,160
the three hundred then we can have four
 

325
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,150
the three hundred then we can have four
let the four hundred some job bigger

326
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:46,160
let the four hundred some job bigger
 

327
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,350
let the four hundred some job bigger
than three right but if

328
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:47,360
than three right but if
 

329
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,550
than three right but if
that if we have four here right

330
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:50,560
that if we have four here right
 

331
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,870
that if we have four here right
look if we let the four hundred number

332
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:52,880
look if we let the four hundred number
 

333
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,469
look if we let the four hundred number
three

334
00:06:54,469 --> 00:06:54,479
three
 

335
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,629
three
what happened three can handle the

336
00:06:56,629 --> 00:06:56,639
what happened three can handle the
 

337
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,830
what happened three can handle the
number four

338
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:57,840
number four
 

339
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,029
number four
exactly right okay so so this is the

340
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:01,039
exactly right okay so so this is the
 

341
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,589
exactly right okay so so this is the
strategy so in order to do this what we

342
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:03,599
strategy so in order to do this what we
 

343
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:04,950
strategy so in order to do this what we
need to do

344
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:04,960
need to do
 

345
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,070
need to do
what do we need to do what do we need to

346
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:08,080
what do we need to do what do we need to
 

347
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,710
what do we need to do what do we need to
do

348
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:08,720
do
 

349
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,430
do
what do we need what do we need to do we

350
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:11,440
what do we need what do we need to do we
 

351
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,629
what do we need what do we need to do we
need to

352
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:12,639
need to
 

353
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,909
need to
find complete us so

354
00:07:15,909 --> 00:07:15,919
find complete us so
 

355
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:19,189
find complete us so
look complete task okay and then

356
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:19,199
look complete task okay and then
 

357
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,710
look complete task okay and then
i have a task task

358
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:22,720
i have a task task
 

359
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,830
i have a task task
and i have a people right all right

360
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:28,840
and i have a people right all right
 

361
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,629
and i have a people right all right
okay

362
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:32,639

 

363
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,510

so the numbers are not in order so what

364
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:35,520
so the numbers are not in order so what
 

365
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,390
so the numbers are not in order so what
should we do

366
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:36,400
should we do
 

367
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,749
should we do
what should we do we should what

368
00:07:39,749 --> 00:07:39,759
what should we do we should what
 

369
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:54,500
what should we do we should what
what's with that you shall throw them

i told you many times for the sorting

374
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:58,960
i told you many times for the sorting
 

375
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,990
i told you many times for the sorting
it's especially

it's especially
 

377
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,189
it's especially
uh special complexity every time we

378
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:03,199
uh special complexity every time we
 

379
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,710
uh special complexity every time we
log and lock it in

380
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:06,720
log and lock it in
 

381
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:19,990
log and lock it in
again okay

382
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:20,000

 

383
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,990

the size of these two does not need to

384
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:22,000
the size of these two does not need to
 

385
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,110
the size of these two does not need to
be equal okay

386
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:23,120
be equal okay
 

387
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,869
be equal okay
let's say the the the task the

388
00:08:26,869 --> 00:08:26,879
let's say the the the task the
 

389
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,230
let's say the the the task the
this is n n task and m keeper okay so

390
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:30,240
this is n n task and m keeper okay so
 

391
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,310
this is n n task and m keeper okay so
the time complexity for this task

392
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:32,320
the time complexity for this task
 

393
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,750
the time complexity for this task
is o and log n and

394
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:35,760
is o and log n and
 

395
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,589
is o and log n and
people is o m log m right right

396
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:39,599
people is o m log m right right
 

397

people is o m log m right right
so you can choose the maximum or you

398
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:41,279
so you can choose the maximum or you
 

399
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,709
so you can choose the maximum or you
place it together because we know she

400
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:42,719
place it together because we know she
 

401
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:43,750
place it together because we know she
always likes it

it's already salted but yeah good

406
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:50,320
it's already salted but yeah good
 

407
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,350
it's already salted but yeah good
question but

408
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:51,360
question but
 

409
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,710
question but
if it's already sauteed now we don't

410
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:52,720
if it's already sauteed now we don't
 

411
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,710
if it's already sauteed now we don't
need to sort it okay but i'm assuming we

412
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:54,720
need to sort it okay but i'm assuming we
 

413
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,190
need to sort it okay but i'm assuming we
we

414
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:55,200
we
 

415
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,430
we
we need to sort it okay okay okay good

416
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:57,440
we need to sort it okay okay okay good
 

417
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,870
we need to sort it okay okay okay good
question now

418
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:58,880
question now
 

419
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,350
question now
now look let's say the answer answer is

420
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:01,360
now look let's say the answer answer is
 

421
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,030
now look let's say the answer answer is
the number of jobs

422
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,040
the number of jobs
 

423
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,110
the number of jobs
we can complete the maximum yeah at the

424
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:05,120
we can complete the maximum yeah at the
 

425
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,790
we can complete the maximum yeah at the
beginning so now

426
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:06,800
beginning so now
 

427
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,829
beginning so now
let's have a two pointer i equals z

428
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:09,839
let's have a two pointer i equals z
 

429
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,750
let's have a two pointer i equals z
equals zero okay right

430
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:13,760
equals zero okay right
 

431
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,470
equals zero okay right
maybe let's do it look task equals

432
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:16,480
maybe let's do it look task equals
 

433
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:16,949
maybe let's do it look task equals
people

434
00:09:16,949 --> 00:09:16,959
people
 

435
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,710
people
equals zero this is the point pointing

436
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:18,720
equals zero this is the point pointing
 

437
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,389
equals zero this is the point pointing
to the beginning

438
00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:20,399
to the beginning
 

439
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,310

00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:24,080
one smallest right
 

443
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,310

smallest task the smallest people the
 

445
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,910
smallest task the smallest people the
index right

00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:27,920
index right
 

447
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,230
index right
okay the length let's just store it why

448
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:32,240
okay the length let's just store it why
 

449
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,430
okay the length let's just store it why
t smaller than lens task right

t smaller than lens task right
 

451
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,350
t smaller than lens task right
because we haven't run out of tasks

look people are two bigger than
one right yeah so we we can let the two

502
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:44,240
one right yeah so we we can let the two
 

503
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:44,790
one right yeah so we we can let the two
hundred

504
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:44,800
hundred
 

505
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,350
hundred
one right because 2 is the smallest

506
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:47,360
one right because 2 is the smallest
 

507
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,389
one right because 2 is the smallest
number bigger than

508
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:48,399
number bigger than
 

509
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,430
number bigger than
or equal to so let's say answer

510
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:51,440
or equal to so let's say answer
 

511
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,230
or equal to so let's say answer
plus equals 1 right and what happened to

512
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:54,240
plus equals 1 right and what happened to
 

513
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:54,470
plus equals 1 right and what happened to
t

514
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:54,480
t
 

515
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,269
t
and p what should we do the p can handle

516
00:10:57,269 --> 00:10:57,279
and p what should we do the p can handle
 

517
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:13,269
and p what should we do the p can handle
t so what should we do after next

518
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:13,279

 

519
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,910

it because yeah because when i am

520
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:15,920
it because yeah because when i am
 

521
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,829
it because yeah because when i am
completely stressed i have to move the

522
00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:17,839
completely stressed i have to move the
 

523
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:18,389
completely stressed i have to move the
next

524
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:18,399
next
 

525
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,670
next
big task right and people i have uh

526
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:21,680
big task right and people i have uh
 

527
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,470
big task right and people i have uh
these people is is already taken a job

528
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:24,480
these people is is already taken a job
 

529
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,990
these people is is already taken a job
right a task then i have

530
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:26,000
right a task then i have
 

531
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,269
right a task then i have
moved to next people with yeah so what

532
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:29,279
moved to next people with yeah so what
 

533
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,949
moved to next people with yeah so what
p plus equals one t plus equals one

534
00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:32,959
p plus equals one t plus equals one
 

535
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:33,750
p plus equals one t plus equals one
right

536
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:33,760
right
 

537
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,190
right
all right now look okay so

538
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:37,200
all right now look okay so
 

539
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,550
all right now look okay so
let's see if this is zero okay let's say

540
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:40,560
let's see if this is zero okay let's say
 

541
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,230
let's see if this is zero okay let's say
if this is here the people with

542
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:42,240
if this is here the people with
 

543
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,949
if this is here the people with
strength yellow okay no strength at all

544
00:11:44,949 --> 00:11:44,959
strength yellow okay no strength at all
 

545
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,670
strength yellow okay no strength at all
okay so what happened

546
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:47,680
okay so what happened
 

547
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,509
okay so what happened
the people cannot handle t so what

548
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:49,519
the people cannot handle t so what
 

549
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,030
the people cannot handle t so what
should we do now

550
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:51,040
should we do now
 

551
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,470
should we do now
what should we do now we shall

552
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:54,480
what should we do now we shall
 

553
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,750
what should we do now we shall
we shall move right we should try

554
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:57,760
we shall move right we should try
 

555
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,430
we shall move right we should try
next people to see if we can find it

556
00:11:59,430 --> 00:11:59,440
next people to see if we can find it
 

557
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,190
next people to see if we can find it
right right yeah right

558
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:01,200
right right yeah right
 

559
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,030
right right yeah right
yeah yeah okay so let's s

560
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:05,040
yeah yeah okay so let's s
 

561
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:23,590
yeah yeah okay so let's s
as p plus equals one right right

562
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:23,600

 

563
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,590

in both cases we need to p plus or equal

564
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:25,600
in both cases we need to p plus or equal
 

565
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,670
in both cases we need to p plus or equal
one right so we can

566
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:27,680
one right so we can
 

567
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,030
one right so we can
erase this erase this

568
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:31,040
erase this erase this
 

569
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,230
erase this erase this
and i will put a p plus one here

570
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:34,240
and i will put a p plus one here
 

571
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,629
and i will put a p plus one here
this makes sense because if then i do

572
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:36,639
this makes sense because if then i do
 

573
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,629
this makes sense because if then i do
this and do this as

574
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:38,639
this and do this as
 

575
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,190
this and do this as
if this is not eq not true then i would

576
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:41,200
if this is not eq not true then i would
 

577
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:41,990
if this is not eq not true then i would
do this right

578
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:42,000
do this right
 

579
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,350
do this right
it's shorter and much better right

580
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:45,360
it's shorter and much better right
 

581
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,949
it's shorter and much better right
it's the same right doesn't make sense

582
00:12:50,949 --> 00:12:50,959

 

583
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,190

think that one yeah yeah yeah does it

584
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:53,200
think that one yeah yeah yeah does it
 

585
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,710
think that one yeah yeah yeah does it
make sense are we

586
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:54,720
make sense are we
 

587
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,430
make sense are we
yeah okay so what's the term complexity

588
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:57,440
yeah okay so what's the term complexity
 

589
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,350
yeah okay so what's the term complexity
of this one

590
00:12:59,350 --> 00:12:59,360
of this one
 

591
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,310
of this one
all of this this one just this one if

592
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:02,320
all of this this one just this one if
 

593
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,030
all of this this one just this one if
you're sorted

594
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:03,040
you're sorted
 

595
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,829
you're sorted
you don't need to consider this but this

596
00:13:04,829 --> 00:13:04,839
you don't need to consider this but this
 

597
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,350
you don't need to consider this but this
part

598
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:07,360
part
 

599
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,269
part
n is the number of tasks m is number of

600
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:09,279
n is the number of tasks m is number of
 

601
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:14,389
n is the number of tasks m is number of
people

602
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:14,399

 

603
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,910

o max and and which one is bigger right

604
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:17,920
o max and and which one is bigger right
 

605
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,550
o max and and which one is bigger right
doesn't make sense so which which one is

606
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:20,560
doesn't make sense so which which one is
 

607
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,310
doesn't make sense so which which one is
dominating if we need to sort

608
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:22,320
dominating if we need to sort
 

609
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,350
dominating if we need to sort
the arrays first this one yeah

610
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:25,360
the arrays first this one yeah
 

611
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,790
the arrays first this one yeah
this one so this one is taking the

612
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:28,800
this one so this one is taking the
 

613
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,629
this one so this one is taking the
the most time-consuming part in this one

614
00:13:30,629 --> 00:13:30,639
the most time-consuming part in this one
 

615
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,670
the most time-consuming part in this one
okay

616
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:33,680

 

617
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,910

so this is trivial okay so now

618
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:37,920
so this is trivial okay so now
 

619
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,110
so this is trivial okay so now
okay so if a answer is

620
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:41,120
okay so if a answer is
 

621
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,949
okay so if a answer is
one yeah because people can handle this

622
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:44,959
one yeah because people can handle this
 

623
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,910
one yeah because people can handle this
task and then what should we do now

624
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:47,920
task and then what should we do now
 

625
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,829
task and then what should we do now
sorry k sorry

626
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:51,839

 

627
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,949

what time t p what i

628
00:13:54,949 --> 00:13:54,959
what time t p what i
 

629
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,150
what time t p what i
what l equals one

630
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:58,160
what l equals one
 

631
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,590
what l equals one
yeah not okay

632
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:01,600
yeah not okay
 

633
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,829
yeah not okay
okay so that's it for today so this is

634
00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:03,839
okay so that's it for today so this is
 

635
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,110
okay so that's it for today so this is
called greedy okay because

636
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:05,120
called greedy okay because
 

637
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,550
called greedy okay because
we have greedy strategies yeah greedy is

638
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:08,560
we have greedy strategies yeah greedy is
 

639
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,030
we have greedy strategies yeah greedy is
hungry

640
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,040
hungry
 

641
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,160
hungry
that's it see you tomorrow bye
