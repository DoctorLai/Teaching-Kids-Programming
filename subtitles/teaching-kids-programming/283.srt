1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:07,359
hello mr mr ryan are you all right today

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,440
good okay so today we talked about

3
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:10,559
another problem in the metric okay

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:15,639
metric

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,639
so look at this metric okay i have leave

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,840
so this is the four times five five

7
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,599
times four matrix so can you find the

8
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:34,239
largest area whatever

9
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,480
that's the largest area of the square

10
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,559
metric square square

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,480
you know it has to be square

12
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:43,040
yes square yeah that's what i was gonna

13
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,200
say yeah so that's nine right but i

14
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,640
could also be sixteen

15
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,600
no why is it sixteen right that's

16
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,320
assistant no you can't find any sixteen

17
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,000
right the ones means that

18
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,280
you can't include the zero yeah one we

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,840
want to find the largest square largest

20
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,600
largest square subnet sheet okay

21
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,680
submetric

22
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,439
some magic

23
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,439
yeah with one yeah with one

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,280
okay

25
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,400
the problem is clear yeah

26
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,240
how can we do this how can we do this

27
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,400
right any thoughts any sort we can do

28
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,400
this

29
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,799
how can we pull first

30
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,799
by using a brief booth how can we go

31
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,799
first

32
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,360
so we're going to check every square

33
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,640
right okay so that's it we want to try

34
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,640
yeah proof of work okay

35
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,720
we're done perform

36
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,479
so we try we can how can we pull first

37
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,840
we proof of each

38
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,799
okay we when we meet when we have one

39
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,360
yeah

40
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,719
we try to brute force

41
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,920
the metric

42
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,399
just

43
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,040
yeah if this is one right look at me

44
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,439
come on if it is one we try to blue

45
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,759
force the matrix the square metric

46
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,879
starting the left top left corner equals

47
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:13,680
one right and we start to expand it

48
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:15,840
yeah if it is all ones

49
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,319
if it is all once we update the answer

50
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,879
and yeah we want to have account

51
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:23,440
account to update the answer all right

52
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,640
so what what's the code would be like so

53
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,480
for r

54
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,920
for r in range

55
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,760
row for c in range column right

56
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,800
and if matching

57
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,920
rc equal one then we can start we can

58
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:42,400
start the size yeah we can say say four

59
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:46,480
for size s equal s range from one two

60
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,640
to one two three four minutes

61
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,319
to the minimum of uh uh you know when it

62
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,440
reaches border right and then we need to

63
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:56,160
check this metric with the size s so we

64
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:59,680
we start with the coordinate rc

65
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,360
and we size we start increasing right

66
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,360
size from

67
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,440
what one to

68
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,440
something to something yeah to something

69
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,239
we can put it infinity but actually it's

70
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,920
not infinity i just said something yeah

71
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,800
i didn't know it all right do you

72
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,800
understand me and i will check if if all

73
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,360
informatics and this

74
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,200
if this is geometric it contains all

75
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,360
ones if it's all once then we update the

76
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,040
answer so what's the time complexity if

77
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,959
you if i don't write a curve if i just

78
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,280
tell you this is providing what's the

79
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:32,280
thumbnail

80
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,280
um

81
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:38,000
this is look we iterate with oic i can't

82
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,720
see but we need to check these

83
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,159
metrics yeah check the battery so what i

84
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,640
don't know

85
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,239
so look if it is magic here

86
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,040
i don't know what did you call the

87
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,040
matrix

88
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,000
what's imagine that it doesn't matter

89
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,879
look at you release this size ah another

90
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,400
eye

91
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:03,519
drake's name a matrix metric name

92
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,760
m for example

93
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,959
no m matrix it has r

94
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,680
column c

95
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,680
and so look at you look

96
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,080
just give one example look if you if you

97
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,720
start from the top left corner right and

98
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,759
that's a one and then

99
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,079
for each

100
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,720
you uh you want to check if all the r

101
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:25,040
rows and c columns are one so you need

102
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,600
to take another one c times right

103
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,199
right checking would take polacy

104
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,600
right and then each one could be one if

105
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,960
we can consider a metric containing all

106
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,000
one right

107
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,520
right this is a very special case we we

108
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,440
need to go through each pizza right

109
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,400
because each pizza is one

110
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,160
all right

111
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,880
and for each pizza i want to check if

112
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,199
the largest what is the largest sub

113
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,520
metric right so i need to expand this

114
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,520
right look for here i need to explain it

115
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,400
so let's analyze it so

116
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,960
together is all r squared c squared

117
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,320
got it it's very slow right if i see you

118
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,919
speak

119
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,039
make sense

120
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,880
make sense

121
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,880
yeah make sense yeah make sense

122
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,160
so we can do this we can the thing is

123
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,240
that why this is slow because every time

124
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,280
yeah every time you're checking you're

125
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,280
checking

126
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,759
you you have this duplicate checking

127
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,600
right because look if i check these

128
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,440
if i check this this is not matching

129
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,440
it's all one and then when i check this

130
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,440
method

131
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,440
i already know this is a

132
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,600
matrix right so i have to but i have to

133
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,000
check it again so it's duplicated you

134
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,000
get it yeah so for example i'm here at

135
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,600
this one ah i'm ready to spawn okay

136
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,039
everything's here yeah

137
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,120
alexa

138
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:42,639
okay i want to check this big this

139
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:45,440
moment okay okay all ones good i know

140
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,280
it's a square metric or four but now i

141
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,199
want to check here

142
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,120
so i i still need to check here the

143
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,600
small one right right i want to check

144
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,080
all the one so it's duplicate duplicate

145
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,960
effort to check in uh suck some metric

146
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,759
okay

147
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,520
so we can save it so we can

148
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,759
we don't want to repeatedly do that

149
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,400
again and again because that's slow so

150
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,000
in some way we want to use the dynamic

151
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,919
programming to save

152
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,639
the intermediate result okay so how can

153
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,160
we do this we can create a metric of dp

154
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,960
pp array right

155
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,199
with the same size if r

156
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:22,479
our column row sequence we want to

157
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:25,039
create a metric with r rows c columns

158
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,639
which is the same size right and then

159
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,319
what does it mean

160
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,000
it means that

161
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,039
it means that from the

162
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,759
this this means that the deep array

163
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:38,319
the submetric the area from zero zero

164
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:41,759
from top left corner to

165
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:46,000
rc yeah dprc

166
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:48,639
in this area the largest the largest

167
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,319
the largest sum square summit

168
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,880
doesn't make sense eric

169
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,479
so this this number here represents the

170
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,919
largest

171
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,919
largest square

172
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:04,000
some metric yeah

173
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:06,000
if we we if we define it as the side

174
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,919
right left side is and how can we get

175
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,560
the area

176
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,000
so if a square has the side n what's its

177
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,639
area

178
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,479
it's easy question side eq

179
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,639
right

180
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,800
ryan ryan

181
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,560
it's a sub square which is side of 4

182
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,280
what is area

183
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,080
16 yeah okay if the square is n what's

184
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,560
the size what's that area

185
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,400
well done good job yeah n square okay so

186
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,039
let's store it as n

187
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,319
the the side the largest side right so

188
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,840
now

189
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:42,319
now look if i'm here i'm here

190
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,520
i'm here okay i i'm going to process

191
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,720
this one

192
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:49,039
so i i already know the largest square

193
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,800
here right and if this is one this is

194
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,800
one this is one this one

195
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,360
then the answer would be the minimum of

196
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,800
these three points plus one right so

197
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,680
look i want to update this this dpr plus

198
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,360
one

199
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:05,440
r plus one and c plus one right if if

200
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,400
this is one right

201
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,400
if this is one and this is one

202
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,879
and this is one

203
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,360
so what what what can i get i can the

204
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,720
answer of dpr plus one

205
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,440
is the minimum

206
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,120
it's the minimum of all these

207
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,960
and then plus one right

208
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,520
yeah because i can extend i can just

209
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,890
extend it by one right i can extend it

210
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,680
by one because it's all one right got it

211
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:32,159
[Music]

212
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,719
yeah this is the dp array and db zero

213
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:38,159
zero if it is zero what happened if this

214
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:41,519
kind of point is zero then dp rc is zero

215
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:43,360
right because there is no point

216
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,000
am i right

217
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,000
does that make sense

218
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,399
yeah yeah

219
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:54,800
so can we convert it can we write it

220
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,160
okay let's write it okay

221
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,800
define

222
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,800
largest

223
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,279
symmetric soft square magic

224
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,480
okay and

225
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,279
and then let's say

226
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,920
ah

227
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:14,800
c equals length m

228
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,320
and column will be length and m y

229
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,680
and what

230
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,320
and what

231
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:24,080
come on what's the columns of m

232
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,360
and lens of m1 put that number here

233
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,800
put the number

234
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,880
yeah we're done

235
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,640
oh now i'm going to create a dp array

236
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:34,640
dpri equals

237
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:36,880
at the beginning cl for underscore in

238
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:40,480
range

239
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:43,120
range columns right the columns

240
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,120
and then

241
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,680
for

242
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,680
in range m

243
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,760
so this creates a this creates uh

244
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,160
what is this two d what's this two dp

245
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,880
array this creates one a two dimensional

246
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,839
array which contains all zero and then

247
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,680
you'll be

248
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,600
you'll be the same size of m right so

249
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:09,440
you'll be arrows

250
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,880
arrows and c columns arrows

251
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,079
and c columns

252
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:16,240
okay and all zero or zero

253
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:21,040
okay so now i just need to go through

254
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,040
each one for r in range r

255
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,079
four c in

256
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,000
range

257
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:31,120
c right

258
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,399
right okay i go through this one and if

259
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,480
if what

260
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,160
if matrix

261
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,680
ah c

262
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,480
equal equal

263
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,760
zero right if current is zero what does

264
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,560
it mean

265
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:49,440
yeah it means that well

266
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:51,440
it means what there's no magic ending

267
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,560
okay so let's dp already

268
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,320
i mean

269
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:58,320
make a mistake dprc means what 0.000 so

270
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,720
it means that when it ends

271
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:04,399
so that that is square metric ending and

272
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:08,160
ending at rc here right ending at rc

273
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:10,399
okay at this area so if mrc equals zero

274
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,040
then we need to set dp

275
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,360
rc equals one

276
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,360
if this point if this is zero can it be

277
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,839
um can you form a

278
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,760
square matrix and then this one

279
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,839
no so we set it to

280
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:28,399
zero

281
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:30,399
as the s is one right now we

282
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,920
also we have answer answer equals zero

283
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,399
we want to written the answer which is

284
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:37,040
the answer will be written answer times

285
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:39,920
answer okay einstein times two angle

286
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:42,160
square the answer is the largest side

287
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,279
note area and the area is time is square

288
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,720
right

289
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,279
okay then

290
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,240
and what should we do if r bigger than

291
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,200
zero

292
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,240
and

293
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,399
c bigger than zero okay right

294
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,200
and one and then you can say

295
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:59,920
m

296
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:02,800
r minus one c equals equal one right and

297
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:05,920
yeah look i'm at this point rc

298
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,680
i'm at at least point one okay here this

299
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,880
is rc

300
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,480
and then i have a few yeah metric here

301
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,720
i'm at this point

302
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,240
right so if it's bigger than zero if

303
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,959
it's if it's bound if it's on the

304
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,399
boundary here or here

305
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,079
you come from a

306
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:25,200
bigger magic right because it's on the

307
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:27,760
boundary but at other points places

308
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,000
i want to check this one

309
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,480
it's this one this is one this is this

310
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,720
one and then i want to if these these

311
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,600
three are all ones yeah

312
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,360
and

313
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:43,040
r c minus one equal equal one and and

314
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,720
can you what's this point and one

315
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,279
what

316
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,680
one more what's this

317
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:52,399
r minus one and c minus one right look

318
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,399
this is rc

319
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:01,200
equals the mean

320
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:03,680
mean of which three numbers

321
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:07,200
which is numbers

322
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:09,680
it will be dp mean of dp

323
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,440
r plus minus 1c

324
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,279
and dp

325
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,560
rc minus 1

326
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:20,800
and dpy can you tell me the third one

327
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:23,200
come on dpr minus 1 um r minus one c r c

328
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,320
minus one what's this one

329
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,480
minus one

330
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,639
c one is one yeah

331
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,440
i want to get a minimum of these ending

332
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:34,880
these and then what do what

333
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,320
plus one right plus one yeah

334
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,279
plus one

335
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,040
and once i plus one i

336
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,720
at this point here i i can do this

337
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,000
answer equals

338
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,440
maximum

339
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,720
answer

340
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,800
dp

341
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:52,079
rc right so i can i learn can

342
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,600
get the

343
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:58,079
largest square lattice side of this of

344
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:01,600
the answer right and then return this

345
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:04,240
yeah got it so this is the dp function

346
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,760
plus one so why is it first because we

347
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,199
already know

348
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:11,600
yeah we already know

349
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,800
when we want to calculate these right we

350
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,639
already know what happened in the

351
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,600
previous one we already know what

352
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,959
happened

353
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,279
previous one

354
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,120
that previous one

355
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,120
so square matching i just added one a

356
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,560
little bit right

357
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,920
yeah got it

358
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,360
yeah

359
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:31,639
okay so now uh what's the time

360
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,639
complexity if you look at this curve

361
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:37,839
how many loops how many loops are there

362
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:41,120
um there are

363
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:42,440
two two so our

364
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,399
square

365
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:47,680
times

366
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,680
what's the space complexity

367
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,839
are there any space

368
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:58,199
are we using a space dp array yeah so

369
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,199
what's your term also space complexity

370
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,680
okay can you explain to me why we put

371
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,519
the answer answer equals max answer dprc

372
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,920
what are these two because we need to

373
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:10,000
find the biggest square biggest square

374
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,160
ending yeah what's what could be the

375
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,120
biggest square it could be the biggest

376
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:17,360
square could be ending at

377
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,279
rc each location ending at large

378
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,079
location right okay

379
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,880
yeah

380
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:27,199
okay and then we pretend why why this is

381
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,199
new answer time times what does this

382
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,399
is

383
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,680
largest largest side of the square right

384
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,920
right now we need to turn some to what

385
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,920
is good because we have one sine of

386
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,560
square u and

387
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:55,199
the other side yeah it's the formula to

388
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,079
compute the area given the side right

389
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,800
like

390
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,680
if

391
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,839
if a square the side has five and then

392
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,079
its area is five times right yeah that's

393
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,519
what exactly is that does it okay and

394
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:08,639
what was this part

395
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,399
if mrc if this is a zero what does it

396
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:13,759
mean if it is the zero why we need to

397
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,759
set dprc equals zero

398
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,079
because

399
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:21,199
if it just

400
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:24,480
it wouldn't be yeah the

401
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:26,480
the side of anything at rc

402
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,040
there's no right because you can't look

403
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,519
this is zero i want to add there is no

404
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,759
way to find a metric which ends here

405
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,959
right because this is zero right there

406
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,000
is no

407
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:40,079
no way to to construct a matrix

408
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
equilibrium ending at this point which

409
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:44,560
is zero right right great

410
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,720
that's why we set it to zero correct

411
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:49,360
this makes sense

412
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:52,399
okay dprc is the dynamic programming

413
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,880
right yeah zero for range and c columns

414
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:57,199
and then subreddit of magic yeah

415
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:01,560
okay a little bit okay thank you good

416
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:01,560
job today bye bye say bye
