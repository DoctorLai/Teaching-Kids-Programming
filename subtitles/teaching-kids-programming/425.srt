1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
yo

2
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:06,560
hello mister miss arena all right yes

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,080
so what's the step we talk about stack

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,679
that thing first

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,320
out okay

6
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,160
fuzzy now yeah

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,160
first thing that's like

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,160
fascinating

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,359
and then now if i want to take it out i

10
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,439
need to take two offers and then take

11
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,440
one right yeah

12
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,520
okay so let's say if i have a sequence

13
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:39,200
like put push

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,360
push sequence one two three four five

15
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,840
okay and then i have another sequence

16
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,399
pop okay

17
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,039
listen

18
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,600
so for example you'll be four five

19
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,320
five four three two one so is this

20
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,079
is this sequence one possible one

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,079
possibility of

22
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,719
of uh

23
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:01,359
you know is one of the probability if we

24
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,680
push the elements in such sequence

25
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,680
is it

26
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:09,200
so one two three four five and then how

27
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,200
can we get the five four three two one

28
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,400
that's easy that's a very easy one okay

29
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,479
how about yeah you know four five

30
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,000
four five okay

31
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:28,240
how about four five three two one

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,240
not really four five three two one how

33
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,759
can you get the four wise which one yeah

34
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,720
yeah oh

35
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,000
you got one yeah and then you put it in

36
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,200
put three

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,240
put four

38
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,240
and then take out four yeah

39
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,720
[Music]

40
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,560
that it's not possible

41
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,399
so let's make it simple okay let's make

42
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,399
it simple let's let's consider that i

43
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,280
know why it's not possible

44
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,240
okay

45
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,840
um

46
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,159
um two two one three four five

47
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,320
okay wait two one three four five two

48
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,280
one three four five

49
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,200
why

50
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,039
why this is not possible

51
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,959
two one three four five let's do this

52
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,520
all right two one six one five oh my god

53
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,840
i shouldn't

54
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,720
yeah because you why the y okay what

55
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,280
four two one three so five so it's one

56
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,560
two

57
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,680
take two

58
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,800
pick one for the three

59
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,360
take three

60
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,480
put the four what is possible yeah oh

61
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,959
god damn it it's it's possible

62
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,959
try another

63
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,080
[Music]

64
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,440
yeah

65
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,959
take three out for the four take four

66
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:57,599
hours two

67
00:02:52,959 --> 00:03:01,040
one five it's simple stuff yeah okay um

68
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,920
um okay two one five five five five no

69
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,400
no

70
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,319
five you're very close to it i mean okay

71
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,040
so by the way these animals are unique

72
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,400
okay we we talk about it you need

73
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,200
yeah

74
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,080
so the push and the top that

75
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,480
pop contains unique elements unique yeah

76
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,480
and then

77
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,560
one two

78
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,239
three four five yeah i take five out and

79
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,280
then i count because i have to take a

80
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,879
four right

81
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,319
that's a good way that's good so

82
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,560
so okay so

83
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:47,200
that's very good so push and push

84
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,360
contents only unique okay and then top

85
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,040
also is a unique element and

86
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,400
the number of elements in the push is

87
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,959
the number of anime in the top okay so

88
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,640
how do we check how do we check why this

89
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,680
is not possible if by looking at this

90
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,680
why this is not possible

91
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,799
because you put this because first thing

92
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:13,280
i lost out yeah so this one is first so

93
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:17,199
it obviously be lost and this one is

94
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:20,720
lastly obviously before um

95
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:23,040
okay and so this will be first but

96
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,520
bring you the one two three four five

97
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,400
and then this is obviously the end of

98
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,400
the two and

99
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,800
[Music]

100
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,720
yeah but that's not quite why is that

101
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,440
because look because you can't take out

102
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,800
one because if there are two numbers if

103
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,120
there are two numbers

104
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,560
one and two so you could be one two or

105
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,520
two one right

106
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,000
yeah

107
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,000
one two or two one so

108
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,960
it's not if you if you look if we're

109
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,360
looking at these two only two numbers

110
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,960
you count right the problem is one the

111
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,800
problem is this one why is that because

112
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,320
look if you take if you

113
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,960
take five out

114
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,080
and the next one is four

115
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,960
right

116
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,800
the next one is is four you can't take

117
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:12,000
you can't take uh

118
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,240
you can take one out

119
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,199
you can't take one out

120
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,400
without taking four three two right

121
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,360
yeah

122
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:24,400
so put it this way put it this way if i

123
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:27,440
have any money if one two three now the

124
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,840
pop pop element i want the three here

125
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,720
i want i want to put the next element

126
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,840
the the next element here if i even if

127
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,320
the pop sequence is three something

128
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,720
so i i need to take this i do i i need

129
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,759
to take it all right everyone yeah why

130
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:46,639
is that why is that why is that

131
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,479
get it because after

132
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,000
what happened if i don't take look now

133
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:53,039
this is the same

134
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,560
then because then um you can't take 201

135
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,800
now

136
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,800
uh

137
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,000
yes okay

138
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,720
um

139
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,280
yeah

140
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,600
okay so the thing is look yeah yeah look

141
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,000
if now the top of eddie a total steak is

142
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,639
three and then now the next element to

143
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,400
pop out is three if i don't take the

144
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,000
three out

145
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,280
what happened then you can't take out

146
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,919
two and one out no if i put any element

147
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:25,199
something element x here right

148
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,479
if i take x and four for example

149
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,720
right

150
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,400
right so so if i don't take it out so

151
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,560
the next it can't

152
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,479
if i push another element out then the

153
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,479
three can't be taken without taking the

154
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,240
form but we are done we want the four we

155
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,720
own the three first right

156
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,720
you get it

157
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,840
this is the key part okay listen no no

158
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,560
please don't do that no

159
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,400
look

160
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,000
now the top of element is top of the

161
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,240
stack is three

162
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,720
and then the next element is three one

163
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,800
to take out if we if at this time this

164
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,720
is the best term if we don't take it off

165
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,759
it means that we need to push some

166
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:04,639
element to the top right if we put it on

167
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,160
all right so what does it mean if we in

168
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,319
in the future we want to take the three

169
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,520
out we need to take the four first

170
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,199
right

171
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,800
make sense

172
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,400
so that that doesn't work right because

173
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,160
we want to take a three hour if this is

174
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,680
the good time okay i'm telling you that

175
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,560
this is a good time to take the three

176
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,560
out

177
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,479
but you say okay i don't want to take a

178
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,560
three i want to wait in the future but

179
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,319
when the future i push another element

180
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,720
so what happens if you want to take a

181
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:31,039
three hour you need to take the phone

182
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,039
right

183
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,599
you want everything

184
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:50,240
so with this approach is that if as long

185
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:52,879
as we have the element

186
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,560
top of the stack equals to the top next

187
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,280
four element we just take it off

188
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,759
otherwise we will miss the chance

189
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,599
right so at the end we just

190
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,720
check if they are

191
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:05,360
uh

192
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,919
if we just check if the stack is empty

193
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:12,199
right then that will be

194
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,199
good enough okay let's do this

195
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,479
and then after that

196
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,560
and then we're going to walk through the

197
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:25,759
steps and then you can understand how it

198
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,280
works okay so first of

199
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,360
let's say define

200
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,360
valley

201
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,159
okay valid

202
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,919
uh

203
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,399
stack sequence

204
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,599
stack sequence yeah okay we have this

205
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,240
push

206
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,919
we also have a problem there's they are

207
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,919
the same

208
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,360
same number they contain the same number

209
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,279
of the

210
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,160
equal they are equivalent equivalence of

211
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:53,680
the numbers okay

212
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,959
so now we have uh this i i equals zero

213
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,279
points to the

214
00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:00,720
this is in that point points to which

215
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:03,600
element we we are about to pop next and

216
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,920
we have a stack st stack equals at least

217
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,839
which is a stack then we go through the

218
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,120
sequence of the push for next number and

219
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,440
in

220
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,680
push

221
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,800
right so first of all

222
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:21,519
we need to push st dot append append put

223
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,640
it in the right sp open n okay and then

224
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,640
now look

225
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,480
we need to check right

226
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,760
y let's st

227
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,160
means that

228
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:34,240
come on look why the top of this white

229
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,240
stack is not empty and

230
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:39,360
and the top of the stack st minus one

231
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,760
is

232
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,640
equals to the next port element right on

233
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,640
the top everyone

234
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,760
also

235
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:53,760
also actually actually i have to add it

236
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:57,200
actually we especially check if i also i

237
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,640
is smaller than the length of the pop

238
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,720
okay

239
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,920
so just make sure it doesn't go outside

240
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,360
the boundary

241
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,720
along with the wall we just do and we

242
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,959
just do what

243
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,680
i plus equals one we move to the next

244
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,240
one

245
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:15,040
and st dot top

246
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,279
and then at the end just return

247
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:20,880
it return we can return two things

248
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:22,800
return length as t equals zero

249
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,680
all right this is all

250
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,200
oh oh i put the comma here or not st

251
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,920
this is the same thing

252
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,519
or we can do i we can do this i check

253
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,560
equals the length

254
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,560
of top okay

255
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,519
okay this is the angle okay

256
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,680
let's do this here

257
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,839
one

258
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,600
two this is the push here push it until

259
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,680
three four five

260
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,079
and then the element is four five three

261
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,320
two four five three two one okay

262
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:57,600
and then we're going to check if this

263
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,040
this is the wonderful possibility of the

264
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,000
popping

265
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,760
popping from the stack if the sequence

266
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,279
is one two three four five or one

267
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,079
pushing element okay how do we do it

268
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,959
look

269
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,360
all right

270
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:13,120
that's t

271
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,120
this is the stack i equals zero

272
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
why can we use the stack as emptiness

273
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,000
right

274
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,040
why can we use the list as an empty

275
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,399
state

276
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,760
because we can take what st probably

277
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,640
probably say

278
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:41,440
yeah first thing yeah okay

279
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:44,079
okay now look for push

280
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,160
all right look yeah we're here

281
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:48,480
s t dot attack i

282
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:52,000
apparent n so what do we do

283
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:55,760
what do we do we take we put the

284
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,480
everyone look look at me we put the one

285
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,320
in the stem right

286
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,680
everybody come on let's put that one in

287
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,760
this step

288
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,440
and then here go here

289
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,240
look what's this what does this mean

290
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,240
here we're here

291
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,399
right here while the stack is not empty

292
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,760
and

293
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:17,519
i is smaller than the stack size yes

294
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,000
length of top equals five yeah by the

295
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,639
way length of top equals five this time

296
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,040
and the top of that xt minus one equals

297
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,040
the prop

298
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:31,330
[Music]

299
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,920
points the first element to pop right

300
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,959
come on this is very important right

301
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,560
here

302
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,399
okay so what do we do

303
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,920
we just don't enter this loop and then

304
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,120
we go to the next what's the next

305
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,399
element

306
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,560
two

307
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,839
we put a two here yeah

308
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,040
is the two

309
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:53,279
the top of the step two equals to four

310
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,880
no right sorry don't take so what's the

311
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,040
next three

312
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,839
yeah i put it in

313
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,279
and the same it doesn't equal to four

314
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,680
right

315
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:05,760
four i put it in okay here this is

316
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,000
interesting now

317
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,160
at least i'm pushing the four now and

318
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,320
after four here

319
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,639
these four equals the top of the stack

320
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,079
right xt minus one right

321
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,680
yeah

322
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:21,200
so what do we do

323
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:23,600
we take it off yeah we take it out and

324
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,440
we we we take it out and we move this i

325
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,720
i plus one here

326
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,720
yeah

327
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,279
okay again

328
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:34,000
five is equals to the top of that no

329
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:36,720
right so again i put you the five here

330
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,920
okay look five

331
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,320
five

332
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,079
equals the top of the stack right

333
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,279
so what do we do

334
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,279
what do we do

335
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,720
uh we um

336
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:51,040
what do we do if it's the same what do

337
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:53,279
we do we pop take it off and then i

338
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,079
move to the next alright so it looks

339
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,279
three

340
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:59,199
equals three equals the top of the three

341
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,959
what do we do we take it off

342
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:04,000
move to the next

343
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:06,560
yeah two you guys lost over two

344
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,560
take it off

345
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:11,199
take it off so

346
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,880
at the end

347
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:15,279
the stack is empty

348
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,920
so it's a valid sequence right it's a

349
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,920
very secret otherwise it's not okay oh

350
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,320
let's let's do what's the what's the

351
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,920
secret it doesn't work five one

352
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,680
two three four yeah

353
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,519
okay

354
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,000
look at this five one

355
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:33,199
three two four yeah okay okay come on

356
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,680
listen okay let's do it

357
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:37,519
one push it in yeah

358
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,320
the top of the stake equals five now

359
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,519
right

360
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,120
push your two

361
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:45,519
is it the same no no three

362
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,360
no

363
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,600
four no

364
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,920
so look we want to compare the top up to

365
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,079
the left right right no right five yes

366
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,600
right so what happened we take it out

367
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,639
and move it to here

368
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,040
yeah

369
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,040
one the

370
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,519
but there's no more elements to push

371
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,839
and then so we just go out yeah the

372
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:10,800
stack has four elements so what does it

373
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:12,959
mean these two elements can't be pushed

374
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,880
why is that because we want to push the

375
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,880
we want to pop one

376
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,800
but one is at the bottom

377
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,320
you can't pop one without popping four

378
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,360
three two one

379
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,600
right

380
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,399
first and two but i want to we want to

381
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,639
make sure one is the next to pop but the

382
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,639
top of the stack is four so it doesn't

383
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,759
work this way

384
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,079
makes sense

385
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:38,079
so the gritty part is here look

386
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:40,160
why the stack is not empty and

387
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:42,560
i smaller than that okay obviously we

388
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,240
have to check this eye pointer if it's

389
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,759
smaller if it's smaller than the pop

390
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:49,040
element okay

391
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:51,279
if it is then look as long as okay this

392
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,320
is the key part today as long as the

393
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:56,880
next element to pop out

394
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,600
is the same as topple stack

395
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:02,320
okay look then what do we do we take it

396
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,519
out we move it pop it yeah we take it

397
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,880
out of it

398
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,399
it's not it's the same we take it out

399
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,720
from it and at the end we check the

400
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:11,279
length of his legs yeah okay the time

401
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,720
complexity

402
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,720
the time connection what's the tango

403
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,000
next thing think about it if there are

404
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,959
an anime

405
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,320
you know

406
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,560
if there are any elements what's the

407
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:23,560
timetable

408
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,560
um

409
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,519
this looks like

410
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,519
look at this looks like

411
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,000
uh these are any inner look but it

412
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,519
doesn't affect the overall time

413
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,199
complexity why why is that why is that

414
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,800
why is that because look

415
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:47,600
they are at most

416
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,199
and most anonymous to pop okay as long

417
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,000
as popping

418
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:54,399
as long as finish and then that you

419
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,639
won't be as this loop won't be executed

420
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:59,199
again make sense

421
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:02,000
why is that look this eye pointer only

422
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:03,199
goes forward it doesn't go backward

423
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,520
right

424
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:08,480
the eye pointer is the points to the

425
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:10,640
next element to pop out right

426
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,959
and it only goes forward right so it

427
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,199
only has a must and

428
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,039
and it's duration

429
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,280
after any iteration you won't come in

430
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,880
again and then

431
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,439
uh

432
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,600
yeah and then the first outer loop only

433
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,439
uh iterates and

434
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,240
and times okay

435
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,520
yeah

436
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,080
okay

437
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,559
okay let me give a quiz a quiz and then

438
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,320
you can see if it's uh one two three

439
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:38,400
four five okay and then

440
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,880
how about

441
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,880
how about

442
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,840
three two

443
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:49,280
three two

444
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:49,280
four one five is it possible

445
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,120
is it possible

446
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,440
come on come on you can use this okay

447
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:00,480
let's do it again

448
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,799
one put yeah two

449
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,280
three okay it's the same now take it out

450
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,880
and move it to the next okay two take it

451
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,320
out move it to next

452
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,760
and then

453
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,799
then four

454
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,880
four take it off move to next

455
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:17,360
next

456
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,400
one take one now you have to take one

457
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,120
yeah

458
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:24,160
yeah and then five five okay you get it

459
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,400
yeah perfect okay let's see for today

460
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,519
good job

461
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,519
