1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:04,480
hello

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:07,359
hello mr missouri are you all right okay

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,200
so we have this array real numbers

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,440
can you find the

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,599
index uh the numbers that's the left

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,440
side the sum of the left side equals the

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,920
sum of the right side

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,680
the earliest the smallest index

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,199
so let's say if i

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,840
zero

11
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,560
two and zero so what do you mean

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,560
so if i pick this number yeah

13
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,679
the sum of the

14
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,559
the numbers before these four is five

15
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,520
right

16
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:36,880
yeah the sum after on the right hand

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,960
side is

18
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,040
nine okay so this is not the index we're

19
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,920
looking for so any index that

20
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,320
the the sum of the that numbers on the

21
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,239
left equals the sum of the numbers on

22
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,120
the right so which is the index the

23
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,120
smallest index

24
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,879
yeah so what's the what's the sum on the

25
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,199
left nine what's the on the right

26
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,680
nine yeah so we're looking for zero one

27
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,520
two three so you need to tell me three

28
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,720
easy

29
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,720
get it

30
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,760
so this is the equivalent way we need to

31
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:13,280
find the smallest index the the earliest

32
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,080
index that the numbers on the left

33
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,880
sum

34
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,040
would be equals to the sum on on the for

35
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,439
the numbers on the right okay so look

36
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,080
there's one thing to notice here this

37
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:26,080
number excluding the sum yeah so if you

38
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,680
if you the index here we are not summing

39
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,759
we are not adding this we're excluding

40
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,680
this number on the left and normal right

41
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,640
it doesn't count this number right

42
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,280
okay

43
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,720
okay so this this approach what's the

44
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,640
what's uh

45
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,720
what's the what's the approach you think

46
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,880
in your first thing in your mind what's

47
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,560
the approach

48
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,399
you don't know what's the approach how

49
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,079
many possibilities do we have why do you

50
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,079
say hello

51
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:54,479
come on we are looking for the index so

52
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,479
how how many indexes are there poster

53
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,159
so that could be a approach two force

54
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,960
right

55
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,560
yeah so we can try each possible

56
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,399
number right

57
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,399
yeah we can try each possible number

58
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,800
okay let's do this

59
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:11,120
and then you need to think in mind

60
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,239
what's the term context okay

61
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,879
define like say index find

62
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,879
find index

63
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:24,160
numbers

64
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,840
okay then n equals lens numbers

65
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,120
okay then

66
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,920
for

67
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,879
i

68
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,879
in

69
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,080
range

70
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,560
and right

71
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,080
so what's the left what's the sum look

72
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,040
this is the number yeah this is the

73
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,720
number

74
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:43,599
uh two five zeros uh what's the number

75
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,879
okay two seven zero two five five

76
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,160
something like that so we're going

77
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:50,560
through the index for each one and if i

78
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,360
say this is the index i here

79
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,680
yeah

80
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,239
so what's the sum of that bit

81
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,680
this bit

82
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:02,319
sum

83
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:03,840
if this is l minus one numbers so up to

84
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,640
i minus 1

85
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,040
up yeah but we're up to i right yeah i

86
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,640
not including it right and what's this

87
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,400
bit

88
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:18,400
what's this bit sum

89
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:20,720
i plus 1 yeah i plus 1 i plus 1.

90
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,319
okay so we can just say if

91
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,159
some

92
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,080
number

93
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,440
up to i

94
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,200
equal equal

95
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,040
sum

96
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,000
numbers

97
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,879
i plus one

98
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,799
then we return i right yeah because

99
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:42,319
we're going from left to right so the

100
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,840
earliest we find is the smallest index

101
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,599
otherwise we'll determine minus one if

102
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,840
we can't find any right what's the time

103
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,040
complexity

104
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,400
[Music]

105
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,560
you sure one

106
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,120
square oh it's good why is that can you

107
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,120
tell me why he's always

108
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:03,439
[Music]

109
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,920
when you submit you need to go through

110
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,599
this yeah so look i try this index i

111
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,599
then i need to go through to some of the

112
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:12,560
numbers and then to something okay so

113
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,560
this is all n squared

114
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,680
so can we do better can we do better

115
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,919
obviously yeah otherwise there's no

116
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,240
point

117
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,600
yeah this is the proof of thing

118
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,120
everybody can

119
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,680
come up with it right yeah

120
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,919
so do you still remember this keyword

121
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,800
accumulate

122
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,320
accumulate let's say

123
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,080
okay let's say

124
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:42,560
2 5

125
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:44,880
0 5 2 2 or maybe 2 one

126
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,199
accumulate what's accumulate

127
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,560
accumulate we talk about this accumulate

128
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,520
is they look look

129
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,600
2

130
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,479
2 plus 2 4

131
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:59,759
2 plus 2 plus 1

132
00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:02,160
is five yeah so it means that the sum

133
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,440
of the first i numbers so what's this

134
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,639
what's next

135
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,840
um five and then 10

136
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,759
12

137
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,919
14.

138
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,600
okay so now we have these so if let's

139
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,840
say

140
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,120
what's the sum of the all the numbers

141
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,120
here

142
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,440
oh what's the sum of all the numbers in

143
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,440
in in our way

144
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:27,120
uh it

145
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,120
uh what's all the numbers

146
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:33,120
come on we just have to look at the 14

147
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,639
yeah this is the number of the

148
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,880
of everything here

149
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:40,080
or we can just say sum sum all the

150
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,199
numbers this is total yeah

151
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,160
so

152
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:47,600
and these equals what this equals to

153
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,039
this accumulate this accumulate

154
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,720
numbers

155
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,720
and then

156
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,560
minus one right the last number is the

157
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,560
sum of everything right

158
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,520
okay so if we have these we can go

159
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,600
through this in one time right so what

160
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,840
why this is useful this is the core

161
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:08,639
prefix sum accumulate prefix sum yeah

162
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:11,440
prefix yeah so look if we are going from

163
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,120
here right we know it's 5 up to this

164
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,639
point is 5.

165
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,319
so we know this total is 14 right

166
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:22,240
so so look

167
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:26,720
yeah i know the total number is 14 and i

168
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:28,000
know the sum of the first three numbers

169
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,479
is

170
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,479
is what

171
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:38,479
is is 5. so what's the sum of the

172
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,240
the numbers up to the end what's this

173
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:42,080
bit

174
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,000
this is five what's the what what's the

175
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,080
sum of this bit

176
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,720
what's the sum of this bit

177
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,639
everything here is 14. here it's five

178
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,319
what's this bit what's the sum of this

179
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,440
speed this is one

180
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,800
sorry

181
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,680
41

182
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,800
right

183
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:01,360
nine nine yes fourteen minus five is

184
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,440
nine yeah okay so this is nine

185
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,639
so it means that this number here is

186
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,960
nine

187
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,960
right

188
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,520
plus ten plus twelve yeah

189
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,919
not this one i'm i'm saying okay okay

190
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,479
okay so now look if we have this number

191
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:19,919
we can so basically we have total this

192
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:23,759
is this we have

193
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:25,919
calculated total minus the prefix sum

194
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,039
is the on the right and this is the

195
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,199
right bit

196
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:32,639
but we have to get rid of this thing

197
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:35,440
first so so the prefix sum minus

198
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:38,639
minus this number if it's equals to

199
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:41,039
least sum then we tried it all right so

200
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,280
so look so put it this way put it this

201
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,280
way

202
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,360
so here we are here

203
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,280
uh so we are here we are here we are

204
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,240
here

205
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,840
the left fit is five right these the

206
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,879
first four numbers the sum of the first

207
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,879
four number is five

208
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:03,680
minus this the the the fourth number is

209
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:07,599
zero so the first three number is

210
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,599
five minus zero right

211
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:13,840
the the sum of the numbers next to the

212
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:18,240
on the right hand side of 0 is what

213
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:19,759
is 14 this is total number minus

214
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,039
minus 5

215
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,199
right

216
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:25,039
is it minus 5

217
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,319
14 minus

218
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,560
five

219
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,879
okay so this is nine okay so that's not

220
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,880
equal that's not equal so uh

221
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,360
let's know so

222
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,839
this is not the first example i give in

223
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,599
at the beginning right yeah you didn't i

224
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,399
think that's the problem okay let me

225
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,399
rewrite the example

226
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:49,279
two three two two two three four two

227
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,440
three four okay okay okay so yeah that's

228
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:53,440
not the same okay but but the principle

229
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,360
is the same okay two three four zero

230
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,839
five two two okay let's say let's just

231
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,680
do it okay

232
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,560
two three four

233
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,480
zero five two two okay and the

234
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,279
accumulation will be

235
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,160
two

236
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,279
five

237
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:11,440
nine nine fourteen

238
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:14,480
sixteen eighteen right this is

239
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:17,600
accumulated i came up to this one now we

240
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:20,000
are at these which we tried each poster

241
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,519
index and if we say we are here

242
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,560
right right here

243
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,279
so

244
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:28,080
this the prefix sum of the first the sum

245
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,200
of the first four number is nine yeah

246
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,000
yeah

247
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,279
and nine minus this number zero so that

248
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,560
would be the sum of the first three

249
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:38,720
number which is nine minus zero which is

250
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,320
nine this is the sum of the first three

251
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,360
numbers yeah

252
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,800
okay

253
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,440
the sum

254
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,440
of the

255
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:51,519
the sum of what the the sum of the these

256
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,839
these numbers

257
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,480
this number these are the the numbers on

258
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:59,839
the right yeah which is

259
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:02,399
18 right 18 minus 9 right

260
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,720
another it's it's 18

261
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,680
so this is the sum of the the numbers on

262
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,600
the right is 80 minus nine right yeah so

263
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,839
which is nine

264
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,560
right so look we have a match nine

265
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,680
equals nine so let's say this is three

266
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,839
make sense

267
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,320
yeah

268
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:22,480
yeah so look we just look it up so so

269
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,320
the previous example why is this slow

270
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,279
one squared because we have to calculate

271
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,399
the sum

272
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,800
yeah yeah

273
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:32,480
yeah but now we don't calculate

274
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:35,040
instead what what do we do

275
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,959
this one we just look it up right but

276
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,360
the the number on the right is just the

277
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:43,120
math subtraction i know the total

278
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,120
numbers the sum of the total numbers

279
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:49,360
i know this bit when i write i need to

280
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,600
speed so the the subtraction would be

281
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,800
the sum only right right

282
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,800
okay so let's do this

283
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,600
okay so let's say

284
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,399
okay so accumulate okay so let's say uh

285
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:09,519
total we can say total t

286
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:13,120
t equals sum of all the numbers yeah

287
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,120
first of all we get a number yeah

288
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,680
right and then the prefix okay let's say

289
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,360
p equals

290
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,720
okay let's put a zero at the beginning

291
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,720
and i'll tell you why okay zero plus

292
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,640
i put a zero at the beginning and at

293
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:30,399
least

294
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,399
accumulate accumulate

295
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,959
numbers

296
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,480
okay

297
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,040
numbers

298
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,680
so p we put the zero so

299
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,600
okay so what's the last value of this p

300
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,620
what's the last value of this p remember

301
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,040
accumulate what's the last value of that

302
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:48,800
[Music]

303
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,560
yeah so instead of looking we're going

304
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,800
through these ones we're going through

305
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:56,560
this twice so instead of that we can

306
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:58,320
just do it once then we can say t equals

307
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,320
p

308
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,320
minus one okay

309
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,079
that's our one improvement so instead of

310
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,720
going iterating the array twice we're

311
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:08,079
iterating once yeah because when we do

312
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,240
this accumulate

313
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:12,160
the last value is the sum and we get the

314
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,600
sum for free right we don't need to go

315
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,000
through again right

316
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:19,120
now then i can go through this uh index

317
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,839
for i in range

318
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,760
range length number

319
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,160
yeah because that we're going through

320
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:29,360
the numbers and then we just have to do

321
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,920
what we just have to do

322
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,760
we just have to do if if the

323
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,560
p

324
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,320
i

325
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,200
equal equal the total minus p i plus one

326
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,399
okay

327
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,399
what does it mean along with the 10 i

328
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,000
we can actually otherwise leave a minus

329
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:49,200
one okay

330
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,200
so what does it mean let's say

331
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,440
two three four

332
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,519
zero five two two again this example

333
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,639
yeah so the accumulated function would

334
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,680
be

335
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,720
two

336
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:03,920
five nine nine

337
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:06,079
fifteen sixteen eighteen okay look i put

338
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,000
the zero at the beginning i put a 0 at

339
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,800
the beginning from p

340
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,079
and i go through these i go through this

341
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:16,079
i over here

342
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:18,880
if p i equals t minus p i plus 1 right

343
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:21,200
okay so now i'm at here

344
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,519
t i t i minus one

345
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,480
it's not equal and i move to the next t

346
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,120
i

347
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,920
if p i which is two

348
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,320
p is what it's 18 yeah t is 18 which is

349
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,399
80 this is 18.

350
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:38,240
okay so

351
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:39,839
so look if i is at this point

352
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,959
yeah

353
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:46,000
zero one two three and i plus one is

354
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:48,639
also nine because eighteen minus

355
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,399
eighteen minus

356
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,199
minus nine equals nine right look p i is

357
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,920
nine

358
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:57,680
p i plus one is nine also nine t is

359
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,920
eighteen so look

360
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,680
then we found the match yeah now we're

361
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,199
doing ten i okay

362
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,480
the the

363
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:07,519
the reason we

364
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,639
we added zl at the beginning is that uh

365
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,360
why is that

366
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,800
because that it could be possible that

367
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,600
that's the

368
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,000
the

369
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,480
if it could be possible that if we start

370
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,839
from the first number and the numbers

371
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,920
the sum

372
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,440
before the first number is 0 because

373
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,760
there's no number before the first

374
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,639
number right

375
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,440
there

376
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,160
so

377
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,720
because the index when i is the first

378
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:35,120
zero it means the first number yeah the

379
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,040
first number so if it's the first number

380
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,040
then the numbers there's no numbers

381
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:42,320
before the first number so the sum is

382
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,760
zero so we have to capture these right

383
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,600
okay so what's the time complexity in

384
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,199
this case look

385
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,199
oh and

386
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,560
oh and why is there no one

387
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,279
why is it different than the previous

388
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,600
one

389
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,920
it's cause that you

390
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,680
um

391
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,920
so

392
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:02,000
this is our n now we put it up in a p

393
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,760
this is array and then look

394
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,120
p i

395
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,959
prefix sum

396
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,720
instead of calculating the sum we just

397
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:12,399
look it up that's a one constant right

398
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,560
do you see the difference

399
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,480
the previously previously what's the

400
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,680
previous one this one is what previous

401
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,959
one is what

402
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,639
sum

403
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,320
the numbers

404
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,480
up to i

405
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,480
i

406
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,720
this is one right

407
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,079
but instead i put it here i i do this

408
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,240
accumulating

409
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:36,399
so i only need to do this once and do i

410
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,839
need to change it i know no right i just

411
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:43,040
have to look it look it up right

412
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:44,959
okay this is one way okay another way

413
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:48,560
quite simple

414
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,560
is it quite simple i i i think

415
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,680
you'll be very very simple yeah quite

416
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:56,000
similar idea but instead of doing this

417
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,959
lookup we can just do this

418
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,959
we can just do this

419
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,959
it's quite similar here okay let's say

420
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:06,399
two three four

421
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:08,959
zero five two what's the total sum

422
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:13,680
what's the total

423
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:15,519
so the sum is 18 yes some numbers

424
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,519
when we do this sometimes what's the

425
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:20,320
time complexity we're going to it's

426
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:22,720
calculating all the the number the sum

427
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,600
of all numbers what's that oh oh and

428
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:28,160
yeah we're done because

429
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,399
you have to iterate over all the numbers

430
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,480
in order to find the sum yeah yeah

431
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,399
that's obviously if you don't visit the

432
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,480
number you don't know the sum right yeah

433
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,480
that's always okay so let's total number

434
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,839
is 18. okay

435
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:44,160
okay so that i have not left it

436
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,839
i have a writing

437
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,720
yeah right that is

438
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:51,120
is the t equals t equals 18.

439
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,120
okay so what's the first number

440
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,920
what's the first number no no okay

441
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,279
what's the first number

442
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,480
two okay

443
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:02,079
so two

444
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,959
so left left plus equals two okay plus

445
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:06,160
two

446
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,160
so what happened to the right

447
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,360
subshot two yeah yeah subtract two so

448
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,520
it's eight sixteen

449
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:18,240
okay i put a three

450
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:20,720
on the left

451
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,480
plus three equals five so i have i need

452
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,959
to remove three from the right so

453
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,480
basically you can think of these as the

454
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,440
left and right

455
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,039
left and right you move it move it so

456
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,280
what you increase the you put this

457
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:35,840
number you increase one number on the

458
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,600
left side so that needs to be taken out

459
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,600
from the right hand side

460
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,799
can you imagine

461
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,640
yeah

462
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,160
make sense

463
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,360
so look

464
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:49,039
plus 3 plus four plus and then plus four

465
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,400
which is what

466
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:52,160
nine yeah

467
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,360
and i need to get uh

468
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,880
that one subtract nine

469
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,280
uh

470
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,480
thirteen and now thirteen and now i need

471
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,480
to minus four

472
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,120
which is nine okay then i found the

473
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:07,120
match one left equals right i found it

474
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,039
makes sense

475
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,480
okay can you explain this method to me

476
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:14,840
again

477
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,840
can you explain this message to me

478
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,520
exactly perfect that's the perfect

479
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,280
explanation the right gives the number

480
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,600
to the left so the right the number

481
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:38,880
needs to be deducted from the sum of the

482
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,919
right it needs to be active to the left

483
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,200
right

484
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,760
so so

485
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,880
when i when i have a match

486
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,919
let's see

487
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:50,480
okay so so this is quite similar quite

488
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:52,960
similar to the second approach okay

489
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,919
okay so look

490
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:58,160
uh so right let's say right at the

491
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:01,120
beginning is the sum of all the numbers

492
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,520
yeah this is 010 right and then left

493
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,400
equals zero and the beginning is zero

494
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,240
right

495
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,440
let's equal zero okay

496
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,760
so now

497
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:13,760
for the index and the number yeah for i

498
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,520
see in numerator what's in numerator

499
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,400
come on

500
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:20,559
it is index and the value yeah we're

501
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,760
done index and the value

502
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,360
okay now

503
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,280
the right

504
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,240
needs to

505
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:30,400
minus equal c right we take a c out of

506
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:35,200
the sum of the right right

507
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:35,200
right and then if left equals right

508
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:42,080
that will turn i yeah this is the index

509
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:44,400
then otherwise left

510
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,320
plus equal see right

511
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:50,559
makes sense

512
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,559
yeah and then return minus one there

513
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,200
yeah you got it right look first of all

514
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,559
i take the c

515
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,880
the number from the right hand side

516
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:03,600
and then look there's a t-4 here so we

517
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,440
need to check before we add it so

518
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,840
why is that why we need to check it

519
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,840
before

520
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:15,440
okay two

521
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:17,120
why why is that because because one

522
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,799
because there's even a single number

523
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,200
like two

524
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:23,760
a single number if this is only single

525
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,120
number what's the sum sum is 2

526
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:28,720
right

527
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:32,320
right minus the first number is yellow

528
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:34,640
right and left is yellow so if look if

529
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:37,039
it's a single number the earliest index

530
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,679
is zero right

531
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:42,080
right any single number will happen

532
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:44,080
you have to do that

533
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,400
look any single number look

534
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:50,159
this is i the sum before the first

535
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:53,120
number is zero here this is zero on the

536
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:55,919
right is zero so any single number the

537
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:58,640
earliest index is zero so right look

538
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:01,679
so right minus equal the first number is

539
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,679
zero left equals zero if you if you do

540
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,320
this first what happened left plus

541
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:08,960
equals c then left will never be the

542
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:11,200
same as right make sense

543
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,720
yeah do you know if there's one single

544
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,679
number what happened if you write minus

545
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,120
equals c right is zero and then you give

546
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,799
it to the left

547
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,400
left is not yellow

548
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:23,679
left is two

549
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,280
so left is not equal to right

550
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,679
yeah you see the problem so that's why i

551
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,039
need to make sure left equals right you

552
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,039
get it

553
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:33,840
yeah look

554
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:35,760
only one single number the sum is two

555
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,000
right minus c

556
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:40,159
what what's the value on the right

557
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,840
right is nothing yellow

558
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:46,080
yeah what's the value of left at this

559
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:48,960
point no no i haven't got here

560
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,960
what's the value of that

561
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,520
nothing okay so we should return right

562
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,919
because look if the i is the index the

563
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,679
sum before the first number is yellow

564
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,640
the sum after the first number is there

565
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:02,080
okay

566
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,840
yeah if we add it to c then c

567
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,159
the left is two

568
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:09,120
right so you they will never meet then

569
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:13,480
we return minus one you get it

570
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,480
yeah what the time can brexit

571
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,520
come on what what what's the time to

572
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,440
next thing

573
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,000
right this is our one

574
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,799
this is our and we're going to inc i

575
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,360
saying that c is there okay

576
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:31,200
right we take this value

577
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:33,360
out of the right we check with the left

578
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,200
if can if it's the same

579
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,799
then we find it

580
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,600
right

581
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,720
yeah

582
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:43,360
why this is okay because we are not

583
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:47,039
we are not counting this number the

584
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:48,799
index the value at the index i

585
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,840
make sense

586
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,320
so

587
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,000
yeah and if this is not the case we will

588
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:57,280
move it to the right when we move it to

589
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:01,039
the right look we move it to the right i

590
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:03,520
i plus 1 i plus 2 when this is not the

591
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:05,520
case this is i minus 1 we move it to the

592
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,280
right and we need to add this number we

593
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,679
need to add this number

594
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:12,320
yeah we need to include it in the left

595
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:14,880
and then let's still on the right

596
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:17,520
yeah so we want to move it

597
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:20,320
when we move it we need to

598
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,960
first of all we need to erase this

599
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:25,039
from the right yeah but now we need to

600
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,880
check the left and right bits

601
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,880
right look we are not counting this

602
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,039
number we need to take it out we may not

603
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,280
and then we need to check the sum of

604
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:36,480
left and right if it's equal or not if

605
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:39,440
it's equal great we return otherwise

606
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:42,240
otherwise i need to include this number

607
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:44,720
to the left right

608
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,320
all right correct all right

609
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,480
yeah

610
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,880
that's it for today bye bye
