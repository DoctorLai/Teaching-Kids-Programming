little bit about
 

17
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,109
little bit about
the list in python

18
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:25,119
the list in python
 

19
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,150
the list in python
and there's a few useful

20
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:28,160
and there's a few useful
 

21
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,109
and there's a few useful
python functions to control to uh to

22
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:31,119
python functions to control to uh to
 

23
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,510
python functions to control to uh to
manipulate the list okay

24
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:33,520
manipulate the list okay
 

25
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,030
manipulate the list okay
yeah so list in

26
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:37,040
yeah so list in
 

27
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,069
yeah so list in
python can you

28
00:00:40,069 --> 00:00:40,079
python can you
 

29
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,229
python can you
can you sit down please so remind me

30
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:42,239
can you sit down please so remind me
 

31
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,389
can you sit down please so remind me
what is the list

32
00:00:44,389 --> 00:00:44,399
what is the list
 

33
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,830
what is the list
list is the number one

34
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:47,840
list is the number one
 

35
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,790
list is the number one
yeah always you know already uh just a

36
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:50,800
yeah always you know already uh just a
 

37
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,310
yeah always you know already uh just a
list yeah uh

38
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:52,320
list yeah uh
 

39
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,670
list yeah uh
contains a few uh number elements yeah

40
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:55,680
contains a few uh number elements yeah
 

41
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,110
contains a few uh number elements yeah
so for example like n

42
00:00:59,110 --> 00:00:59,120
so for example like n
 

43
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,630
so for example like n
one three five two four

44
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:02,640
one three five two four
 

45
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,670
one three five two four
this is the least right yes

46
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:05,680
this is the least right yes
 

47
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,429
this is the least right yes
okay one two three four five first

48
00:01:09,429 --> 00:01:09,439
okay one two three four five first
 

49
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:14,230
okay one two three four five first
four seconds

50
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:14,240

 

51
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,950

so if we want to know how many elements

52
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:16,960
so if we want to know how many elements
 

53
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,030
so if we want to know how many elements
in the list

54
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:19,040
in the list
 

55
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,350
in the list
how many elements in the list do you

56
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:21,360
how many elements in the list do you
 

57
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,630
how many elements in the list do you
know how to get it

58
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:22,640
know how to get it
 

59
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,670
know how to get it
no we can use this function called

60
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:25,680
no we can use this function called
 

61
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,390
no we can use this function called
length

62
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:26,400
length
 

63
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,830
length
okay len n so this will give me length

64
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:29,840
okay len n so this will give me length
 

65
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,149
okay len n so this will give me length
and yeah how many one two three four

66
00:01:32,149 --> 00:01:32,159
and yeah how many one two three four
 

67
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,670
and yeah how many one two three four
five

68
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:33,680
five
 

69
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,950
five
so if i want to know the maximum and i

70
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:36,960
so if i want to know the maximum and i
 

71
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,469
so if i want to know the maximum and i
can use this max

72
00:01:38,469 --> 00:01:38,479
can use this max
 

73
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:43,590
can use this max
yeah and that will give me

74
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:43,600

 

75
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,870

maximum the maximum of n is one

76
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:46,880
maximum the maximum of n is one
 

77
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,350
maximum the maximum of n is one
two three four five the maximum of all

78
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:49,360
two three four five the maximum of all
 

79
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,550
two three four five the maximum of all
these numbers

80
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:50,560
these numbers
 

81
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,590
these numbers
is five yes and again

82
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:53,600
is five yes and again
 

83
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,030
is five yes and again
can you guess what's this mean

84
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:57,040
can you guess what's this mean
 

85
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,469
can you guess what's this mean
and what you will give me five

86
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:00,479
and what you will give me five
 

87
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,749
and what you will give me five
minimum i mean

88
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:03,759

 

89
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,149

i know i mean one yeah well and how

90
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:06,159
i know i mean one yeah well and how
 

91
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,869
i know i mean one yeah well and how
about this sum

92
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:08,879
about this sum
 

93
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,229
about this sum
some of all of them is 15

94
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:12,239
some of all of them is 15
 

95
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,670
some of all of them is 15
one wow that's quick 4 9

96
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:15,680
one wow that's quick 4 9
 

97

11 15 yes okay and
 

99
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,630
11 15 yes okay and
this is the basic yeah and how about

100
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:24,640

 

101
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,110

if if i want to know the average

102
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:29,120
if if i want to know the average
 

103
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,910
if if i want to know the average
yeah average do you remember what's the

104
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:31,920
yeah average do you remember what's the
 

105
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,030
yeah average do you remember what's the
average

106
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:33,040
average
 

107
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,309
average
the sum divided by number please please

108
00:02:36,309 --> 00:02:36,319
the sum divided by number please please
 

109
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,869
the sum divided by number please please
the sum divide different number okay so

110
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:38,879
the sum divide different number okay so
 

111
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,229
the sum divide different number okay so
that will become

112
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:40,239
that will become
 

113
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,589
that will become
you can just do this sum and divide it

114
00:02:43,589 --> 00:02:43,599
you can just do this sum and divide it
 

115
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:44,070
you can just do this sum and divide it
by

116
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:44,080
by
 

117
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,350
by
length and right that will give me

118
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:47,360
length and right that will give me
 

119
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,229
length and right that will give me
five numbers that will give me yes yes

120
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:52,239

 

121
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,670

if you want to be youtube you need to

122
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:53,680
if you want to be youtube you need to
 

123
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,509
if you want to be youtube you need to
behave otherwise i'm not uploading to

124
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:55,519
behave otherwise i'm not uploading to
 

125
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,430
behave otherwise i'm not uploading to
youtube do you understand yeah

126
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:57,440
youtube do you understand yeah
 

127
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,750
youtube do you understand yeah
okay so these are built-in functions for

128
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:01,760
okay so these are built-in functions for
 

129
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,830
okay so these are built-in functions for
python do you get

130
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:03,840
python do you get
 

131
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,550
python do you get
so it means that we don't need to

132
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:06,560
so it means that we don't need to
 

133
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,509
so it means that we don't need to
implement it

134
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:07,519
implement it
 

135
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:08,949
implement it
if you want to implement for example

136
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:08,959
if you want to implement for example
 

137
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,830
if you want to implement for example
this mean how do we implement

138
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:11,840
this mean how do we implement
 

139
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,710
this mean how do we implement
yeah if you want to implement this we

140
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:14,720
yeah if you want to implement this we
 

141
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,390
yeah if you want to implement this we
can just do this

142
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:16,400
can just do this
 

143
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,710
can just do this
if i yeah mean

144
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:20,720
if i yeah mean
 

145
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,350
if i yeah mean
yeah then we pick the first number okay

146
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:23,360
yeah then we pick the first number okay
 

147
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,470
yeah then we pick the first number okay
so which is the

148
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:24,480
so which is the
 

149
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,750
so which is the
answer answer is and zero yeah

150
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:27,760
answer answer is and zero yeah
 

151
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,309
answer answer is and zero yeah
this is bracket means the first number

152
00:03:30,309 --> 00:03:30,319
this is bracket means the first number
 

153
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,350
this is bracket means the first number
yeah and then we

154
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:31,360
yeah and then we
 

155
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,789
yeah and then we
all we need to do for looping the in

156
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:34,799
all we need to do for looping the in
 

157
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,070
all we need to do for looping the in
all the elements in the list then check

158
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:38,080
all the elements in the list then check
 

159
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,110
all the elements in the list then check
if the answer comes the minimum if

160
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:41,120
if the answer comes the minimum if
 

161
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,910
if the answer comes the minimum if
the column minimum is smaller than the

162
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:43,920
the column minimum is smaller than the
 

163
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,270
the column minimum is smaller than the
animate in the list

164
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:45,280
animate in the list
 

165
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,830
animate in the list
then we replace the current element

166
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:47,840
then we replace the current element
 

167
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,430
then we replace the current element
equals

168
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:49,440
equals
 

169
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,110
equals
uh rep uh no actually

170
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,120
uh rep uh no actually
 

171
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,630
uh rep uh no actually
if answer if the current element is

172
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:56,640
if answer if the current element is
 

173
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,750
if answer if the current element is
smaller than the

174
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:57,760
smaller than the
 

175
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,309
smaller than the
current minimum then we replace it yeah

176
00:04:00,309 --> 00:04:00,319
current minimum then we replace it yeah
 

177
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,149
current minimum then we replace it yeah
replace it with the current minimum

178
00:04:02,149 --> 00:04:02,159
replace it with the current minimum
 

179
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,750
replace it with the current minimum
yeah okay yes i'm right

180
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:05,760
yeah okay yes i'm right
 

181
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,509
yeah okay yes i'm right
and then return return the answer yeah

182
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:11,519

 

183
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,470

yeah yes if i if the current element if

184
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:14,480
yeah yes if i if the current element if
 

185
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,910
yeah yes if i if the current element if
we find the element which is smaller

186
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:15,920
we find the element which is smaller
 

187
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,789
we find the element which is smaller
than the current

188
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:16,799
than the current
 

189
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:19,189
than the current
minimum then we replace it but but the

190
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:19,199
minimum then we replace it but but the
 

191
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,110
minimum then we replace it but but the
good thing is we don't need to

192
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:21,120
good thing is we don't need to
 

193
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,950
good thing is we don't need to
implement it because it's already built

194
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:22,960
implement it because it's already built
 

195
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,550
implement it because it's already built
in this function we can just use it

196
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:24,560
in this function we can just use it
 

197
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,749
in this function we can just use it
right yeah okay so now you know that

198
00:04:27,749 --> 00:04:27,759
right yeah okay so now you know that
 

199
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,590
right yeah okay so now you know that
if we want to get the first animal we

200
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:29,600
if we want to get the first animal we
 

201
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,990
if we want to get the first animal we
use this n zero right

202
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:32,000
use this n zero right
 

203
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,670
use this n zero right
how about the second element how do we

204
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:33,680
how about the second element how do we
 

205
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,210
how about the second element how do we
get it um

206
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:35,220
get it um
 

207
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:40,230
get it um
[Music]

209
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,990

and one right yes this is the first

210
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,000
and one right yes this is the first
 

211
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,909
and one right yes this is the first
first element is n0 second animation c2

212
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:47,919
first element is n0 second animation c2
 

213
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,030
first element is n0 second animation c2
the next n2 is the third element right

214
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:51,040
the next n2 is the third element right
 

215
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,510
the next n2 is the third element right
it's always start with zero so how about

216
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:53,520
it's always start with zero so how about
 

217
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,550
it's always start with zero so how about
can you make a guess

218
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:54,560
can you make a guess
 

219
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,870
can you make a guess
n minus 1 what is that

220
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:58,880

 

221
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,990

what what can you guess can you just
