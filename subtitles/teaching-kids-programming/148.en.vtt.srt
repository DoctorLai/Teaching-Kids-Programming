00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,749
hey hello mr ryan how are you today is
friday today okay so it's a good weekend

4
00:00:07,749 --> 00:00:07,759
friday today okay so it's a good weekend
 

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:08,150
friday today okay so it's a good weekend
yeah

6
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:08,160
yeah
 

7
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,390
yeah
starting off the weekend okay so today

8
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:10,400
starting off the weekend okay so today
 

9
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,150
starting off the weekend okay so today
we talk about the graph

10
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:12,160
we talk about the graph
 

11
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,570
we talk about the graph
remember what's graph erica

12
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:17,580
remember what's graph erica
 

13
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,510
remember what's graph erica

00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:19,520
[Music]
 

15
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,070
[Music]
is one of the graphs three is the one of

16
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:22,080
is one of the graphs three is the one of
 

17
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:22,870
is one of the graphs three is the one of
the graphs

18
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:22,880
the graphs
 

19
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,429
the graphs
the linked list can be also one graph

20
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:25,439
the linked list can be also one graph
 

21
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:26,230
the linked list can be also one graph
graph

22
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:26,240
graph
 

23
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,070
graph
remember graph is the vertex graph

24
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:30,080
remember graph is the vertex graph
 

25
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,670
remember graph is the vertex graph
gonna have this vertex right vertex

26
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:33,680
gonna have this vertex right vertex
 

27
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,190
gonna have this vertex right vertex
vertex and the edges right

28
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:37,200
vertex and the edges right
 

29
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,030
vertex and the edges right
yeah all right so leave these a graph

30
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:41,040
yeah all right so leave these a graph
 

31
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,549
yeah all right so leave these a graph
a graph we use a g to represent a graph

32
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:44,559
a graph we use a g to represent a graph
 

33
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,229
a graph we use a g to represent a graph
and it's it contains the two elements

34
00:00:48,229 --> 00:00:48,239
and it's it contains the two elements
 

35
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,069
and it's it contains the two elements
took two sets of animal one is the

36
00:00:50,069 --> 00:00:50,079
took two sets of animal one is the
 

37
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,910
took two sets of animal one is the
vertex v

38
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:51,920
vertex v
 

39
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,350
vertex v
and it's their edges e okay

40
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:55,360
and it's their edges e okay
 

41
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,670
and it's their edges e okay
so for example you know you know the

42
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:57,680
so for example you know you know the
 

43
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,270
so for example you know you know the
value of the tree yeah finally choose

44
00:00:59,270 --> 00:00:59,280
value of the tree yeah finally choose
 

45
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,709
value of the tree yeah finally choose
that

46
00:01:00,709 --> 00:01:00,719
that
 

47
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,990
that
uh uh none but

48
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:04,000
uh uh none but
 

49
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,109
uh uh none but
actually are the graphs a simple graph

50
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:07,119
actually are the graphs a simple graph
 

51
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:08,230
actually are the graphs a simple graph
all right look at it

52
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:08,240
all right look at it
 

53
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,190
all right look at it
look there's one two three it's a one

54
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:11,200
look there's one two three it's a one
 

55
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,429
look there's one two three it's a one
special kind of graph

56
00:01:13,429 --> 00:01:13,439
special kind of graph
 

57
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,149
special kind of graph
and look at the edges are they are not

58
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:16,159
and look at the edges are they are not
 

59
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,070
and look at the edges are they are not
that they're not directions

60
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:18,080
that they're not directions
 

61
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,990
that they're not directions
yeah they are unidirectional yeah

62
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:22,000
yeah they are unidirectional yeah
 

63
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,390
yeah they are unidirectional yeah
right undirected and directed graph

64
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:24,400
right undirected and directed graph
 

65
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,429
right undirected and directed graph
right

66
00:01:25,429 --> 00:01:25,439
right
 

67
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,350
right
and directly glass

68
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:29,360

 

69
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,590

and there is because the edges does not

70
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:31,600
and there is because the edges does not
 

71
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,830
and there is because the edges does not
have the the edge does not have these

72
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:33,840
have the the edge does not have these
 

73
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,149
have the the edge does not have these
directions yeah all right this is the

74
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:36,159
directions yeah all right this is the
 

75
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,830
directions yeah all right this is the
vertex

76
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:37,840
vertex
 

77
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,990
vertex
okay sometimes you've got the weight for

78
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:40,000
okay sometimes you've got the weight for
 

79
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,830
okay sometimes you've got the weight for
example you have the weight on it like

80
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:41,840
example you have the weight on it like
 

81
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,230
example you have the weight on it like
that's two that's three that's the

82
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:44,240
that's two that's three that's the
 

83
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,510
that's two that's three that's the
weight yeah

84
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:45,520
weight yeah
 

85
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,830
weight yeah
yeah okay so today um

86
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:49,840
yeah okay so today um
 

87
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,469
yeah okay so today um
so all right all right listen up listen

88
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:52,479
so all right all right listen up listen
 

89
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,510
so all right all right listen up listen
okay

90
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:53,520
okay
 

91
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,510
okay
so today given the graph in

92
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:57,520
so today given the graph in
 

93
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,670
so today given the graph in
in uh you know adjacent

94
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:01,680

j j
 

97
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,910
j j
how do you spell this one basically

98
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:13,920

 

99
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,670

how do you spell adjacent let me check

100
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:15,680
how do you spell adjacent let me check
 

101
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,350
how do you spell adjacent let me check
okay

102
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:17,360
okay
 

103
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,550
okay

e n c y list
 

109
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,949
e n c y list
okay adjacent list this is bad you can

110
00:02:30,949 --> 00:02:30,959
okay adjacent list this is bad you can
 

111
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:31,910
okay adjacent list this is bad you can
have it

112
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:31,920
have it
 

113
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:43,910
have it
so what is inside it

114
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:43,920

 

115
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,350

okay and then that's three okay so

116
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:47,360
okay and then that's three okay so
 

117
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,470
okay and then that's three okay so
this graph how do we represent it in

118
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:50,480
this graph how do we represent it in
 

119
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:50,949
this graph how do we represent it in
these

120
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:50,959
these
 

121
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,550
these
adjacent um

122
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:54,560
adjacent um
 

123
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,630
adjacent um
adjacent this look if we have a

124
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:56,640
adjacent this look if we have a
 

125
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,589
adjacent this look if we have a
direction here

126
00:02:57,589 --> 00:02:57,599
direction here
 

127
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,710
direction here
yeah direction yeah means the age i can

128
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:00,720
yeah direction yeah means the age i can
 

129
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,990
yeah direction yeah means the age i can
have a direction

130
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:02,000
have a direction
 

131
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,949
have a direction
right right all right so how do we store

132
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:04,959
right right all right so how do we store
 

133
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:05,670
right right all right so how do we store
it

134
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:05,680
it
 

135
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,190
it
we store in a list okay a list

136
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:09,200
we store in a list okay a list
 

137
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,149
we store in a list okay a list
a list we can store in a list so the

138
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:12,159
a list we can store in a list so the
 

139
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,910
a list we can store in a list so the
first one is zero so we have

140
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:13,920
first one is zero so we have
 

141
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,030
first one is zero so we have
age zero to one

142
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,040
age zero to one
 

143
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,589
age zero to one
and that's it right or maybe we have

144
00:03:19,589 --> 00:03:19,599
and that's it right or maybe we have
 

145
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,030
and that's it right or maybe we have
another one 0 to 3

146
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:21,040
another one 0 to 3
 

147
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,789
another one 0 to 3
0 3 so for the first element which is 0

148
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:24,799
0 3 so for the first element which is 0
 

149
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,270
0 3 so for the first element which is 0
for the first element is 0 so we have

150
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:27,280
for the first element is 0 so we have
 

151
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,390
for the first element is 0 so we have
this 0

152
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:28,400
this 0
 

153
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,910
this 0
to 1 and 3 okay so that's the first

154
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:31,920
to 1 and 3 okay so that's the first
 

155
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,190
to 1 and 3 okay so that's the first
element of the

156
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:33,200
element of the
 

157
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,390
element of the
list and for six seconds

158
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:36,400
list and for six seconds
 

159
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,750
list and for six seconds
which is one one only goes to two right

160
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:39,760
which is one one only goes to two right
 

161
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,869
which is one one only goes to two right
yeah yeah so it's one and

162
00:03:42,869 --> 00:03:42,879
yeah yeah so it's one and
 

163
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,509
yeah yeah so it's one and
it's two right this is the second animal

164
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:45,519
it's two right this is the second animal
 

165
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:46,149
it's two right this is the second animal
two

166
00:03:46,149 --> 00:03:46,159
two
 

167
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,710
two
and the first is for the third one three

168
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:48,720
and the first is for the third one three
 

169
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,350
and the first is for the third one three
goes to zero only so you put a zero here

170
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:51,360
goes to zero only so you put a zero here
 

171
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,429
goes to zero only so you put a zero here
on the fourth there's no fourth okay so

172
00:03:53,429 --> 00:03:53,439
on the fourth there's no fourth okay so
 

173
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,110
on the fourth there's no fourth okay so
that's it that's the adjacent look

174
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:55,120
that's it that's the adjacent look
 

175
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,190
that's it that's the adjacent look
they're only zero one two three right

176
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:57,200
they're only zero one two three right
 

177
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,390
they're only zero one two three right
zero one two three

178
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:58,400
zero one two three
 

179
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,270
zero one two three
uh oh sorry two two gives nothing go two

180
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:01,280
uh oh sorry two two gives nothing go two
 

181
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,630
uh oh sorry two two gives nothing go two
doesn't have anything so left

182
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:02,640
doesn't have anything so left
 

183
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,070
doesn't have anything so left
like that and three is zero yeah yeah

184
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:08,080

 

185
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,869

so this is the list a list of lists

186
00:04:10,869 --> 00:04:10,879
so this is the list a list of lists
 

187
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:11,670
so this is the list a list of lists
right

188
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:11,680
right
 

189
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,509
right
does it make sense the first element of

190
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:13,519
does it make sense the first element of
 

191
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,869
does it make sense the first element of
releasing

192
00:04:14,869 --> 00:04:14,879
releasing
 

193
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,789
releasing
gives the edges coming out of the first

194
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:18,799
gives the edges coming out of the first
 

195
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:19,990
gives the edges coming out of the first
element which is zero

196
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:20,000
element which is zero
 

197
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,870
element which is zero
so this two one and three so i put a one

198
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:22,880
so this two one and three so i put a one
 

199
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,749
so this two one and three so i put a one
and three

200
00:04:23,749 --> 00:04:23,759
and three
 

201
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,830
and three
look eric so what's these two can you

202
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:27,840
look eric so what's these two can you
 

203
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,830
look eric so what's these two can you
explain to me what's these two

204
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:31,840

 

205
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,830

the first one goes to two right

206
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:37,840
the first one goes to two right
 

207
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,350
the first one goes to two right
yeah and the third one third one goes to

208
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:41,360
yeah and the third one third one goes to
 

209
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,189
yeah and the third one third one goes to
zero okay uh no no no so

210
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:45,199
zero okay uh no no no so
 

211
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,310
zero okay uh no no no so
let's no no okay that's yellow let's one

212
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:48,320
let's no no okay that's yellow let's one
 

213
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,870
let's no no okay that's yellow let's one
that's two that's two two doesn't go

214
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:50,880
that's two that's two two doesn't go
 

215
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,430
that's two that's two two doesn't go
anything

216
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:51,440
anything
 

217
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,070
anything
so it's empty right and then that's

218
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:54,080
so it's empty right and then that's
 

219
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,830
so it's empty right and then that's
three

220
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:55,840
three
 

221
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,070
three
doesn't make sense so adjacent

222
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,080
doesn't make sense so adjacent
 

223
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,270
doesn't make sense so adjacent
adjections

224
00:04:59,270 --> 00:04:59,280
adjections
 

225
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,550
adjections
adjacent list is a list

226
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:02,560
adjacent list is a list
 

227
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,909
adjacent list is a list
right a list of lists a list of the

228
00:05:05,909 --> 00:05:05,919
right a list of lists a list of the
 

229
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,430
right a list of lists a list of the
ages for each each vertex right does it

230
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:09,440
ages for each each vertex right does it
 

231
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,029
ages for each each vertex right does it
make sense

232
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:11,039
make sense
 

233
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,110
make sense
so now look if i give you this this

234
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:13,120
so now look if i give you this this
 

235
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,469
so now look if i give you this this
graph okay

236
00:05:14,469 --> 00:05:14,479
graph okay
 

237
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,590
graph okay
uh maybe a simple one if i give you this

238
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:17,600
uh maybe a simple one if i give you this
 

239
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,469
uh maybe a simple one if i give you this
one

240
00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:18,479
one
 

241
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,230
one
0 to 1

242
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:22,240
0 to 1
 

243
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,270
0 to 1
okay 0 one and one

244
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:25,280
okay 0 one and one
 

245
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,670
okay 0 one and one
two two okay i'll give you a list this

246
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:27,680
two two okay i'll give you a list this
 

247
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,629
two two okay i'll give you a list this
list yeah

248
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:28,639
list yeah
 

249
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,950
list yeah
i want you to reverse it so you just

250
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:30,960
i want you to reverse it so you just
 

251
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,230
i want you to reverse it so you just
need to represent

252
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:32,240
need to represent
 

253
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,390
need to represent
uh using this kind of syntax and then

254
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:34,400
uh using this kind of syntax and then
 

255
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,990
uh using this kind of syntax and then
just reverse the link

256
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:38,000
just reverse the link
 

257
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,390
just reverse the link
how do we do it all you need to do is

258
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:42,400
how do we do it all you need to do is
 

259
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,670
how do we do it all you need to do is
check yes

260
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:47,680

 

261
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:53,270

wait what if is like that

262
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:53,280

 

263
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,189

that's a good question when you reverse

264
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:55,199
that's a good question when you reverse
 

265
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,629
that's a good question when you reverse
it it's the same right

266
00:05:56,629 --> 00:05:56,639
it it's the same right
 

267
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,390
it it's the same right
yeah because we look you you have two

268
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:58,400
yeah because we look you you have two
 

269
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,469
yeah because we look you you have two
ways like when you reverse it one pen

270
00:06:00,469 --> 00:06:00,479
ways like when you reverse it one pen
 

271
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,350
ways like when you reverse it one pen
still has two right okay so how do we do

272
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:03,360
still has two right okay so how do we do
 

273
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:03,749
still has two right okay so how do we do
this

274
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:03,759
this
 

275
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,830
this
all you need to do is reverse it yeah

276
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:05,840
all you need to do is reverse it yeah
 

277
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,510
all you need to do is reverse it yeah
how to university

278
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:07,520
how to university
 

279
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,189
how to university
uh dot dot minus one i think

280
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:11,199
uh dot dot minus one i think
 

281
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,029
uh dot dot minus one i think
minus one okay so that may be hard to

282
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:15,039
minus one okay so that may be hard to
 

283
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,110
minus one okay so that may be hard to
i mean i i i see this is uh easy to

284
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:19,120
i mean i i i see this is uh easy to
 

285
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,510
i mean i i i see this is uh easy to
understand about how to code right so

286
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:21,520
understand about how to code right so
 

287
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,270
understand about how to code right so
look define

288
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:23,280
look define
 

289
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,510
look define
let's say reverse reverse we have a

290
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:25,520
let's say reverse reverse we have a
 

291
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,070
let's say reverse reverse we have a
graph which is the adjacent list a list

292
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,080
graph which is the adjacent list a list
 

293
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,189
graph which is the adjacent list a list
of lists yeah

294
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:29,199
of lists yeah
 

295
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,870
of lists yeah
a list of these okay can i list these

296
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:32,880
a list of these okay can i list these
 

297
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,749
a list of these okay can i list these
it's always not very nice okay so now

298
00:06:37,749 --> 00:06:37,759
it's always not very nice okay so now
 

299
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,070
it's always not very nice okay so now
if the ground is empty we obviously when

300
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,080
if the ground is empty we obviously when
 

301
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,150
if the ground is empty we obviously when
we reverse it it will be empty right

302
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:42,160
we reverse it it will be empty right
 

303
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,749
we reverse it it will be empty right
right then we just return right

304
00:06:45,749 --> 00:06:45,759
right then we just return right
 

305
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:51,350
right then we just return right
right yeah

306
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:51,360

 

307
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,589

okay now we need to create a new graph

308
00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:53,599
okay now we need to create a new graph
 

309
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,749
okay now we need to create a new graph
right let's say new graph is

310
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:55,759
right let's say new graph is
 

311
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,350
right let's say new graph is
ng new graph is ng so what kind of

312
00:06:59,350 --> 00:06:59,360
ng new graph is ng so what kind of
 

313
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,629
ng new graph is ng so what kind of
uh so when we reverse the graph

314
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:02,639
uh so when we reverse the graph
 

315
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,790
uh so when we reverse the graph
what happened to the vertex does it

316
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:04,800
what happened to the vertex does it
 

317
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,070
what happened to the vertex does it
change or not

318
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:06,080
change or not
 

319
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,110
change or not
what change it doesn't change right does

320
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:09,120
what change it doesn't change right does
 

321
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,070
what change it doesn't change right does
it change

322
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:12,080

 

323
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,390

well if there are three three vertex one

324
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:14,400
well if there are three three vertex one
 

325
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,189
well if there are three three vertex one
two three

326
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:15,199
two three
 

327
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,430
two three
when you reverse it how many vertices

328
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:17,440
when you reverse it how many vertices
 

329
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,550
when you reverse it how many vertices
are there

330
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:18,560
are there
 

331
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,670
are there
what are we doing with the vertex

332
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:21,680
what are we doing with the vertex
 

333
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,469
what are we doing with the vertex
no i mean the vertex not the edges edges

334
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:24,479
no i mean the vertex not the edges edges
 

335
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:25,749
no i mean the vertex not the edges edges
we swap it

336
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:25,759
we swap it
 

337
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,790
we swap it
vertex doesn't vertex doesn't change

338
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:28,800
vertex doesn't vertex doesn't change
 

339
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,990
vertex doesn't vertex doesn't change
right that's what i mean yeah

340
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:30,000
right that's what i mean yeah
 

341
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,070
right that's what i mean yeah
what is what which they will reverse the

342
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:32,080
what is what which they will reverse the
 

343
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,469
what is what which they will reverse the
graph you only reverse the edges of the

344
00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:34,479
graph you only reverse the edges of the
 

345
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,029
graph you only reverse the edges of the
graph you don't reverse the vertex right

346
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:37,039
graph you don't reverse the vertex right
 

347
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,589
graph you don't reverse the vertex right
so in this case how about let's do uh

348
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:39,599
so in this case how about let's do uh
 

349
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:40,390
so in this case how about let's do uh
let's create

350
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:40,400
let's create
 

351
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,390
let's create
and locate the space for the graph so we

352
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:42,400
and locate the space for the graph so we
 

353
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,430
and locate the space for the graph so we
allocate a list

354
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:43,440
allocate a list
 

355
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,469
allocate a list
adjacent uh js

356
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:46,479
adjacent uh js
 

357
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,589
adjacent uh js
list right so now we look

358
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:49,599
list right so now we look
 

359
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,950
list right so now we look
at the beginning got empty right empty

360
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:52,960
at the beginning got empty right empty
 

361
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:59,270
at the beginning got empty right empty
each one is empty now how many of them

362
00:07:59,270 --> 00:07:59,280
each one is empty now how many of them
 

363
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,390
each one is empty now how many of them
we don't care in

364
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:02,400

 

365
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,469

range length graph right

366
00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:06,479
range length graph right
 

367
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,029
range length graph right
how many how many vertex are there

368
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:09,039
how many how many vertex are there

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:09,670
how many how many vertex are there

lengths graph yeah original block yeah

372
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:12,639
lengths graph yeah original block yeah
 

373
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,309
lengths graph yeah original block yeah
am i right how many volumes

374
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:14,319
am i right how many volumes
 

375
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,390
am i right how many volumes
are and i want to create a copy of it

376
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:16,400
are and i want to create a copy of it
 

377
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,830
are and i want to create a copy of it
but the copy the list

378
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:17,840
but the copy the list
 

379
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,110
but the copy the list
the graph is empty right

380
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:21,120
the graph is empty right
 

381
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,150
the graph is empty right
so what's this so original is

382
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:24,160
so what's this so original is
 

383
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,670
so what's this so original is
this one one two three

384
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:27,680
this one one two three
 

385
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,869
this one one two three
so what's up ladies and g what is ng

for air length g times so what's
 

401
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,829
for air length g times so what's
happening

402
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:57,839
happening
 

403
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,590
happening
ng is what is the what

404
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:01,600
ng is what is the what
 

405
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,870
ng is what is the what
can you draw can you say what was ng

406
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:04,880
can you draw can you say what was ng
 

407
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,990
can you draw can you say what was ng
what's ng what did i just say

408
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:08,000
what's ng what did i just say
 

409
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,110
what's ng what did i just say
about this ng is the length of

410
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:11,120
about this ng is the length of
 

411
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,910
about this ng is the length of
g yes and i'm copying a list for each

412
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:13,920
g yes and i'm copying a list for each
 

413
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,030
g yes and i'm copying a list for each
one so what what what's

414
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,040
one so what what what's
 

415
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,660
one so what what what's
what what

416
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:16,670

if black means what each edge each

420
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:21,120
if black means what each edge each
 

421
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,190
if black means what each edge each
vertices does not have any edges

422
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:23,200
vertices does not have any edges
 

423
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,150
vertices does not have any edges
right yeah so what does it mean can you

424
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,160
right yeah so what does it mean can you
 

425
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,590
right yeah so what does it mean can you
draw the graph of ng

426
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:29,600
draw the graph of ng
 

427
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,269
draw the graph of ng
come on it's very easy come on

428
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:33,279

 

429
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,430

it's just the opposite you do the same

430
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:35,440
it's just the opposite you do the same
 

431
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,790
it's just the opposite you do the same
about the other deal

432
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:36,800
about the other deal
 

433
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,030
about the other deal
no it's not yet i'm just creating this

434
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,040
no it's not yet i'm just creating this
 

435
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,150
no it's not yet i'm just creating this
i'm not yet

436
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:42,160

 

437
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,130

wow

438
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:45,140

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,630
[Music]
what are you drawing come on this g

442
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:52,640
what are you drawing come on this g
 

443
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,590
what are you drawing come on this g
with the edges i'm just copying

444
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:55,600
with the edges i'm just copying
 

445
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,110
with the edges i'm just copying
allocating

446
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,120
allocating
 

447
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,070
allocating
length g times each one does not have

448
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:00,080
length g times each one does not have
 

449
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,870
length g times each one does not have
any edges

450
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:00,880
any edges
 

451
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,389
any edges
so what happens so like

452
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:04,399
so what happens so like
 

453
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,430
so what happens so like
yeah you just need to draw

454
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:07,440
yeah you just need to draw
 

455
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,350
yeah you just need to draw
is there any edges come on that's what

456
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:09,360
is there any edges come on that's what
 

457
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,590
is there any edges come on that's what
i'm saying does it have any edges

458
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:13,600

 

459
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,870

no and but but what else can you have

460
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:16,880
no and but but what else can you have
 

461
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,990
no and but but what else can you have
the vertex yeah all right so one okay

462
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:20,000
the vertex yeah all right so one okay
 

463
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,550
the vertex yeah all right so one okay
put the two here

464
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:22,560
put the two here
 

465
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,790
put the two here
yeah that's what i mean yeah does it

466
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:24,800
yeah that's what i mean yeah does it
 

467
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,870
yeah that's what i mean yeah does it
does it make sense

468
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:26,880
does it make sense
 

469
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,069
does it make sense
yeah this is the how we store the mg

470
00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:30,079
yeah this is the how we store the mg
 

471
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,069
yeah this is the how we store the mg
but it does not have any links here

472
00:10:32,069 --> 00:10:32,079
but it does not have any links here
 

473
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,710
but it does not have any links here
because we putting it empty but it has

474
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:34,720
because we putting it empty but it has
 

475
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,750
because we putting it empty but it has
lens g because the number of vertex does

476
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:37,760
lens g because the number of vertex does
 

477
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,550
lens g because the number of vertex does
not change

478
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:38,560
not change
 

479
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,870
not change
right does it make sense okay now we

480
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:40,880
right does it make sense okay now we
 

481
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,630
right does it make sense okay now we
need to go through this

482
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:42,640
need to go through this
 

483
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,750
need to go through this
goes through this right just the edges

484
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:45,760
goes through this right just the edges
 

485
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,790
goes through this right just the edges
so now we do this

486
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:46,800
so now we do this
 

487
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:52,069
so now we do this
four

488
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:52,079

 

489
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,990

so that's okay

490
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:56,000
so that's okay
 

491
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,030
so that's okay
four look u v

492
00:10:59,030 --> 00:10:59,040
four look u v
 

493
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,430
four look u v
in enumerate okay yesterday we'll talk

494
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:01,440
in enumerate okay yesterday we'll talk
 

495
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,870
in enumerate okay yesterday we'll talk
about this function what does it mean

496
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:02,880
about this function what does it mean
 

497
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,949
about this function what does it mean
enumerate graph

498
00:11:04,949 --> 00:11:04,959
enumerate graph
 

499
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,150
enumerate graph
what does it mean like you

500
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:08,160
what does it mean like you
 

501
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,069
what does it mean like you
uh yeah enumerate it right

502
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:12,079
uh yeah enumerate it right
 

503
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:16,310
uh yeah enumerate it right
enumerate so you you will be wrong

504
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:16,320
enumerate so you you will be wrong
 

505
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,790
enumerate so you you will be wrong
v will be two so you you'll be a link

506
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:18,800
v will be two so you you'll be a link
 

507
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,310
v will be two so you you'll be a link
between u to v right

508
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:20,320
between u to v right
 

509
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,630
between u to v right
that's what you mean yeah yeah all right

510
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:24,640
that's what you mean yeah yeah all right
 

511
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,069
that's what you mean yeah yeah all right
actually no because you

512
00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:28,079
actually no because you
 

513
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,350
actually no because you
okay so that's a mistake here u u

514
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:31,360
okay so that's a mistake here u u
 

515
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,470
okay so that's a mistake here u u
will be 0 1 2 3

516
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:34,480
will be 0 1 2 3
 

517
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,910
will be 0 1 2 3
the vertex right the vertex v will be

518
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:37,920
the vertex right the vertex v will be
 

519
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,470
the vertex right the vertex v will be
the list

520
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:38,480
the list
 

521
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,509
the list
of edges that u points to right all

522
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:41,519
of edges that u points to right all
 

523
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:42,470
of edges that u points to right all
right

524
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:42,480
right
 

525
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,030
right
okay so for example all right so for

526
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:45,040
okay so for example all right so for
 

527
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,949
okay so for example all right so for
example one also point to three

528
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:46,959
example one also point to three
 

529
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,790
example one also point to three
right so for u u the first iteration the

530
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:50,800
right so for u u the first iteration the
 

531
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,030
right so for u u the first iteration the
u

532
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:51,040
u
 

533
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,230
u
will be zero and the v will be one two

534
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:54,240
will be zero and the v will be one two
 

535
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:54,790
will be zero and the v will be one two
and three

536
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:54,800
and three
 

537
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,350
and three
will open list of two and three right

538
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:57,360
will open list of two and three right
 

539
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,470
will open list of two and three right
yes

540
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:58,480
yes
 

541
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,269
yes
yeah okay so now i need to go through

542
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:01,279
yeah okay so now i need to go through
 

543
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,590
yeah okay so now i need to go through
these each edges which is zero two

544
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:03,600
these each edges which is zero two
 

545
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,710
these each edges which is zero two
zero three right right zero two zero

546
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:06,720
zero three right right zero two zero
 

547
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,350
zero three right right zero two zero
three

548
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:07,360
three
 

549
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,430
three
and i need to reverse it which becomes

550
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:09,440
and i need to reverse it which becomes
 

551
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,470
and i need to reverse it which becomes
two what

552
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:10,480
two what
 

553
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,430
two what
two zero and one

554
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:15,440

 

555
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,629

come on okay so this is okay let's do

556
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:18,639
come on okay so this is okay let's do
 

557
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:19,670
come on okay so this is okay let's do
this zero okay

558
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:19,680
this zero okay
 

559
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,670
this zero okay
zero two zero three and then when i

560
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:21,680
zero two zero three and then when i
 

561
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:32,389
zero two zero three and then when i
reverse it it will be one

562
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:32,399

 

563
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,629

and then v is the number of edges it

564
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:34,639
and then v is the number of edges it
 

565
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:35,910
and then v is the number of edges it
points to right

566
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:35,920
points to right
 

567
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,389
points to right
so when i reverse it it means that u is

568
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:38,399
so when i reverse it it means that u is
 

569
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,910
so when i reverse it it means that u is
pointing to two

570
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:39,920
pointing to two
 

571
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,430
pointing to two
u is pointing to three there are two

572
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:41,440
u is pointing to three there are two
 

573
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,670
u is pointing to three there are two
edges but now i want to reverse it so

574
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:43,680
edges but now i want to reverse it so
 

575
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,389
edges but now i want to reverse it so
you'll be two

576
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:44,399
you'll be two
 

577
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,470
you'll be two
zero and two is yellow right so i need

578
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:46,480
zero and two is yellow right so i need
 

579
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,750
zero and two is yellow right so i need
to go through each

580
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:47,760
to go through each
 

581
00:12:47,760 --> 00:13:05,750
to go through each
edges which is one four okay

582
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:05,760

 

583
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,269

v yes u is the from

584
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:09,279
v yes u is the from
 

585
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,829
v yes u is the from
the zero v is two and three of course v

586
00:13:11,829 --> 00:13:11,839
the zero v is two and three of course v
 

587
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:12,470
the zero v is two and three of course v
yeah

588
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:12,480
yeah
 

589
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,350
yeah
right and then now what we have these

590
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:15,360
right and then now what we have these
 

591
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:15,990
right and then now what we have these
edges

592
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:16,000
edges
 

593
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,550
edges
we want to add edges to the new graph

594
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:18,560
we want to add edges to the new graph
 

595
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,269
we want to add edges to the new graph
which is

596
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:19,279
which is
 

597
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:23,190
which is
v1 which is what k

598
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:23,200
v1 which is what k
 

599
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,389
v1 which is what k
which is what k and what is the edge the

600
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:26,399
which is what k and what is the edge the
 

601
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,110
which is what k and what is the edge the
reverse edge will be k1

602
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:29,120
reverse edge will be k1
 

603
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,389
reverse edge will be k1
k vertex k

604
00:13:32,389 --> 00:13:32,399
k vertex k
 

605
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,750
k vertex k
u of v come on uh u

606
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:35,760
u of v come on uh u
 

607
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:44,150
u of v come on uh u
yeah okay now we do this ng okay

608
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:44,160

 

609
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,829

don't worry u don't you ng is at least

610
00:13:47,829 --> 00:13:47,839
don't worry u don't you ng is at least
 

611
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:53,350
don't worry u don't you ng is at least
so what matter are we going to a ng

612
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:53,360

 

613
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,750

which measure the opposite of pop what's

614
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:55,760
which measure the opposite of pop what's
 

615
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,710
which measure the opposite of pop what's
the opposite

616
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:56,720
the opposite
 

617
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:09,990
the opposite
a pen come on doesn't make sense

618
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:10,000

 

619
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,069

what are we doing here which is the

620
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:12,079
what are we doing here which is the
 

621
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,550
what are we doing here which is the
reverse graph

622
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:14,560
reverse graph
 

623
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:31,350
reverse graph
return

624
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:31,360

 

625
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,110

what's the term complexity

626
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:35,120

 

627
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,870

okay so if they are if they are

628
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:38,880
okay so if they are if they are
 

629
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,389
okay so if they are if they are
v and v vertex and each one has

630
00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:42,399
v and v vertex and each one has
 

631
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,990
v and v vertex and each one has
e edges so what's the term complexity

632
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:46,000
e edges so what's the term complexity
 

633
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,590
e edges so what's the term complexity
if they are v vertex and each one has

634
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:49,600
if they are v vertex and each one has
 

635
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:56,829
if they are v vertex and each one has
has a varies if they are el

636
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:56,839

 

637
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:58,470

edges

638
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:58,480
edges
 

639
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,750
edges
uh v v vertex

640
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:01,760
uh v v vertex
 

641
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,269
uh v v vertex
and each one has e edges i'm just saying

642
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:05,279
and each one has e edges i'm just saying
 

643
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,350
and each one has e edges i'm just saying
each one has e says v

644
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:09,360
each one has e says v
 

645
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,110
each one has e says v
and what yeah the total number of edges

646
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:13,120
and what yeah the total number of edges
 

647
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,150
and what yeah the total number of edges
will be v and e right so

648
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:16,160
will be v and e right so
 

649
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,550
will be v and e right so
the terms and velocities of o v e right

650
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:18,560
the terms and velocities of o v e right
 

651
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,790
the terms and velocities of o v e right
what's the space complexity

652
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:20,800
what's the space complexity
 

653
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,310
what's the space complexity
um

654
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:24,320

 

655
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,030

there's no n i mean

656
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:29,040

 

657
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,470

yeah over here we are retaining this

658
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:30,480
yeah over here we are retaining this
 

659
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,389
yeah over here we are retaining this
yeah written in this copy yeah

660
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:32,399
yeah written in this copy yeah
 

661
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,629
yeah written in this copy yeah
all right all right okay so can you tell

662
00:15:34,629 --> 00:15:34,639
all right all right okay so can you tell
 

663
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,949
all right all right okay so can you tell
me which part is that to reverse it

664
00:15:38,949 --> 00:15:38,959

 

665
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,710

reverse the graph how are we doing with

666
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:40,720
reverse the graph how are we doing with
 

667
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,310
reverse the graph how are we doing with
why this is reversing it

668
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:44,320
why this is reversing it
 

669
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,030
why this is reversing it
yeah something what does this mean

670
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:47,040
yeah something what does this mean
 

671
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,629
yeah something what does this mean
what's this mean

672
00:15:48,629 --> 00:15:48,639
what's this mean
 

673
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:55,829
what's this mean
k in v what's v vertex

674
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:55,839
k in v what's v vertex
 

675
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,949
k in v what's v vertex
yes with the vertex which vertex

676
00:16:00,949 --> 00:16:00,959

 

677
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,430

so look what's this what umd what's this

678
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:03,440
so look what's this what umd what's this
 

679
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,870
so look what's this what umd what's this
mean

680
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:04,880
mean
 

681
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,310
mean
u is this and v

682
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:08,320
u is this and v
 

683
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,509
u is this and v
is this yeah u is that

684
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:11,519
is this yeah u is that
 

685
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,189
is this yeah u is that
each vertex we are checking and the v

686
00:16:15,189 --> 00:16:15,199
each vertex we are checking and the v
 

687
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:19,829
each vertex we are checking and the v
will be the the edges it points to right

688
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:19,839
will be the the edges it points to right
 

689
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,829
will be the the edges it points to right
yeah like two and three and then we go

690
00:16:21,829 --> 00:16:21,839
yeah like two and three and then we go
 

691
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,749
yeah like two and three and then we go
into this two and three and what we do

692
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:23,759
into this two and three and what we do
 

693
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,069
into this two and three and what we do
is that we add

694
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:26,079
is that we add
 

695
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,470
is that we add
at the two and three pointing back to

696
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:28,480
at the two and three pointing back to
 

697
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,189
at the two and three pointing back to
the u

698
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:29,199
the u
 

699
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,470
the u
right right does it make sense

700
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:32,480
right right does it make sense
 

701
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,030
right right does it make sense
okay doesn't make sense yes does it does

702
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:35,040
okay doesn't make sense yes does it does
 

703
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,069
okay doesn't make sense yes does it does
make sense for you harry

704
00:16:38,069 --> 00:16:38,079

 

705
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:43,430

707
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,470

i think that would be it for today yeah

708
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:46,480
i think that would be it for today yeah
 

709
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,310
i think that would be it for today yeah
okay that will be it for today let me

721
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,510

you need to understand what it means not

722
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:17,520
you need to understand what it means not
 

723
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,909
you need to understand what it means not
remember it okay you need to understand

00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:37,410

 

735
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:45,029

[Music]

736
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:45,039

 

737
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,549

which is the start of the reverse edges

738
00:17:48,549 --> 00:17:48,559
which is the start of the reverse edges
 

739
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,750
which is the start of the reverse edges
so because look we want to we know the

740
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:51,760
so because look we want to we know the
 

741
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,710
so because look we want to we know the
current energy

742
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:52,720
current energy
 

743
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,150
current energy
is what is u

744
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:56,160
is what is u
 

745
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,270
is what is u
to k right what's the reverse

746
00:17:59,270 --> 00:17:59,280
to k right what's the reverse
 

747
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,789
to k right what's the reverse
kt okay to you so what okay to you how

748
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:02,799
kt okay to you so what okay to you how

do you
 

751
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,909
do you
put it in the graph how do you put it in

752
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:05,919
put it in the graph how do you put it in
 

753
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,190
put it in the graph how do you put it in
a graph

754
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:07,200
a graph
 

755
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,630
a graph
if it's what if it's k to you

756
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:10,640
if it's what if it's k to you
 

757
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,150
if it's what if it's k to you
right a pen g

758
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:14,160
right a pen g
 

759
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,950
right a pen g
yeah what a panel you put a pen yo first

760
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:16,960
yeah what a panel you put a pen yo first
 

761
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:23,430
yeah what a panel you put a pen yo first
come on open yours

762
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:23,440

 

763
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:31,990

765
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,270

so what what graph is are we modifying

766
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:35,280
so what what graph is are we modifying
 

767
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,789
so what what graph is are we modifying
what graph

768
00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:38,799

 

769
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,830

what graph are we retaining what we

770
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:40,840
what graph are we retaining what we
 

771
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:49,990
what graph are we retaining what we
modify

772
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:50,000

 

773
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,430

which advertise okay

774

which advertise okay
 

775
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,029
which advertise okay
yeah you just said k to u right because

776
00:18:57,029 --> 00:18:57,039
yeah you just said k to u right because
 

777
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,029
yeah you just said k to u right because
now it's u to k

778
00:18:59,029 --> 00:18:59,039
now it's u to k
 

779
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,230
now it's u to k
all right okay and g

780
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:02,240
all right okay and g
 

781
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,830
all right okay and g
remember ng is the list a list of a list

782
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:05,840
remember ng is the list a list of a list
 

783
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,190
remember ng is the list a list of a list
each list is the number of the number of

784
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:09,200
each list is the number of the number of
 

785
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,350
each list is the number of the number of
vertex that current vertex points to

786
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:11,360
vertex that current vertex points to
 

787
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,029
vertex that current vertex points to
right so nguy

788
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:15,039

 

789
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,390

yeah how do you pull the ngk come on

790
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:18,400
yeah how do you pull the ngk come on
 

791
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,590
yeah how do you pull the ngk come on
what's good bracket yeah break it put

792
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:21,600
what's good bracket yeah break it put
 

793
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:33,510
what's good bracket yeah break it put
it there yeah this bracket

794
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:33,520

 

795
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,390

you're missing one thing column no

796
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:36,400
you're missing one thing column no
 

797
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,390
you're missing one thing column no
column dot

798
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:38,400
column dot
 

799
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,190
column dot
this is the list we need this method

800
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:41,200
this is the list we need this method
 

801
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,470
this is the list we need this method
you're calling the method

802
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:42,480
you're calling the method
 

803
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,549
you're calling the method
dot yeah not a pen you're not putting it

804
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:44,559
dot yeah not a pen you're not putting it
 

805
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,150
dot yeah not a pen you're not putting it
together

806
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:46,160
together
 

807
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:53,280
together
doesn't make sense now okay say bye
