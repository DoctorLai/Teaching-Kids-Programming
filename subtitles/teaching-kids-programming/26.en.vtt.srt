about
the cloud and which is called

22
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:25,519
the cloud and which is called
 

23
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,950
the cloud and which is called
oop which stands for

24
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:28,960
oop which stands for
 

25
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,630
oop which stands for
object oriented programming

26
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:32,640

 

27
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,190

object oriented we're talking about

28
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:35,200
object oriented we're talking about
 

29
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,069
object oriented we're talking about
class

30
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:36,079
class
 

31
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,510
class
car not clock yeah yeah can can

32
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:39,520
car not clock yeah yeah can can
 

33
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,229
car not clock yeah yeah can can
can i can you pay attention please

34
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:42,239
can i can you pay attention please
 

35
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,389
can i can you pay attention please
object already programming okay

36
00:00:44,389 --> 00:00:44,399
object already programming okay
 

37
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,029
object already programming okay
so everything in real world we can model

38
00:00:47,029 --> 00:00:47,039
so everything in real world we can model
 

39
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,229
so everything in real world we can model
as

40
00:00:48,229 --> 00:00:48,239
as
 

41
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,510
as
objects class and objects right

42
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:51,520
objects class and objects right
 

43
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,590
objects class and objects right
so there are two concepts one is class

44
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:55,600
so there are two concepts one is class
 

45
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,510
so there are two concepts one is class
the other one is object

46
00:00:59,510 --> 00:00:59,520
the other one is object
 

47
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,750
the other one is object
okay so class we can call it as

48
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:03,760
okay so class we can call it as
 

49
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:10,070
okay so class we can call it as
object template object template

50
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:10,080

 

51
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,350

you know what's template the ten

52
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:13,360
you know what's template the ten
 

53
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,390
you know what's template the ten
plate template it's like

54
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:16,400
plate template it's like
 

55
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,590
plate template it's like
what's template what does it mean like

56
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:17,600
what's template what does it mean like
 

57
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,710
what's template what does it mean like
the speed i don't know it's like a

58
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:20,720
the speed i don't know it's like a
 

59
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,950
the speed i don't know it's like a
speed no it's it's like

60
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:24,960
speed no it's it's like
 

61
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,469
speed no it's it's like
uh how to put it this way uh it's this

62
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:30,479

 

63
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:32,789

you know the stem yeah yeah that's like

64
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:32,799
you know the stem yeah yeah that's like
 

65
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,550
you know the stem yeah yeah that's like
from template you have a stem and you

66
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:34,560
from template you have a stem and you
 

67
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,230
from template you have a stem and you
can create many many

68
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:36,240
can create many many
 

69
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,550
can create many many
stems right so class

70
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:40,560
stems right so class
 

71
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,870
stems right so class
yes so you can quickly make objects so

72
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:42,880
yes so you can quickly make objects so
 

73
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,389
yes so you can quickly make objects so
cook class

74
00:01:44,389 --> 00:01:44,399
cook class
 

75
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,350
cook class
is object template which can be used to

76
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:47,360
is object template which can be used to
 

77
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,389
is object template which can be used to
create objects

78
00:01:48,389 --> 00:01:48,399
create objects
 

79
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,830
create objects
so put it this way we have in

80
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:51,840
so put it this way we have in
 

81
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,350
so put it this way we have in
in um in person yeah

82
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:55,360
in um in person yeah
 

83
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,590
in um in person yeah
we can use this class okay class

84
00:01:59,590 --> 00:01:59,600
we can use this class okay class
 

85
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,990
we can use this class okay class
and if we define an up class

86
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:04,000
and if we define an up class
 

87
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,069
and if we define an up class
person let's start with the person first

88
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:06,079
person let's start with the person first
 

89
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:14,070
person let's start with the person first
person you know

90
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:14,080

if you're doing the wrong order it
 

131
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,830
if you're doing the wrong order it
wouldn't have one so we we have a

then we
 

155
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,869
then we
after this we can already define we can

156
00:03:36,869 --> 00:03:36,879
after this we can already define we can
 

157
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:37,670
after this we can already define we can
already

158
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:37,680
already

so this is a simple function to check if

350
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:23,520
so this is a simple function to check if
 

351
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,550
so this is a simple function to check if
the object

352
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:24,560
the object
 

353
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,589
the object
is an instant of you know instance

354
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:27,599
is an instant of you know instance
 

355
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,629

objects objects are instance right
 

363
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,350
objects objects are instance right
so when we create objects like eric

364
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:41,360
so when we create objects like eric
 

365
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,630
so when we create objects like eric
and ryan the two independent object we

366
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:44,640
and ryan the two independent object we
 

367
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,750
and ryan the two independent object we
which have different names and age

368
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:47,760
which have different names and age
 

369
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,990
which have different names and age
right there are two different copies of
