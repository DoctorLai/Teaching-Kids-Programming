1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:04,400
hello mr erin mister right now you're

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,680
right

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:10,559
okay so we have talked about try before

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:13,280
yeah a long long time ago try

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:16,480
this is the prefix tree anybody remember

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,760
we have talked about

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,240
all right

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,560
so let's try previous three okay i

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,080
understand you might not remember let's

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,960
review this again

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:30,080
previous trick so if that

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:33,840
if we want to we have a few words right

13
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:36,239
we have a viewer like like eric

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,640
ryan

15
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,120
chelsea he

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,120
cairo

17
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,399
okay okay

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,960
so we have a few words right we have

19
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,960
capitals that's okay

20
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,520
we have these words right and i'm going

21
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,000
to insert it into

22
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,399
and we want to find out look if we want

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,120
to find out if a given a word like he

24
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,600
won't do search yeah you want to search

25
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:07,520
search this a word and then we want to

26
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,600
be able to return if this word is in the

27
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,040
in a word

28
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,920
we could use

29
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,759
we could we could just say what

30
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,920
in was right

31
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,680
but that's going to take over in time

32
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,720
right because we need to do this minimum

33
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,400
search

34
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,640
to check one by one right that's slow

35
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,400
alternatively we can

36
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,159
we can do what we can convert this word

37
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,320
and put it in a hash table notebook

38
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,720
right if we put it in a set

39
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,720
so if we put word equal if we put it in

40
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,840
a set set words right

41
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,680
so all this word in is put in the hash

42
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,600
set and then if we set

43
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,759
if what in

44
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,079
okay so let's say this is a in a what's

45
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,880
the time complexity we do that

46
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:54,240
if we convert these words into a set and

47
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,719
we set we check if the word in a what's

48
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,880
the time complexity

49
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:01,600
i'm sorry

50
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,600
it's not okay

51
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,280
i'm saying convert it to a hash set

52
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,360
we are without the converting we need to

53
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,000
check one by one that's our n if we put

54
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,879
it in a hash set hash table what's the

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,640
lookup time for the

56
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,440
what's the lookup term for

57
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,080
one o one yeah constant that's the

58
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,120
advantage of using the high headset yeah

59
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,640
we talked about that yeah

60
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,920
okay so how about if i wanted to find if

61
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,200
a search

62
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,840
a word has a prefix right so if i if i

63
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,680
if i say this is a

64
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,680
prefix it's not exactly the word right

65
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,400
it could be a prefix

66
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,040
then the hash set may is not working in

67
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,599
this case right because that if i search

68
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:51,440
er you need to tell me okay it's true

69
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:54,720
because er is the prefix of eric right

70
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,959
if i determine if the prefix is chess

71
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,480
and search prefix will return true

72
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,519
because chess

73
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,400
is a prefix of chesley

74
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,400
yeah ryan makes sense

75
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,920
eric makes sense

76
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,760
yeah

77
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,760
okay yeah makes sense so but in this

78
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,599
case how can we do it we will of course

79
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,560
we can do these menus yeah we can do

80
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,680
this

81
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,840
you know and

82
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,239
checking it you know

83
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,800
and by the way this this is not exactly

84
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:26,000
though right we are

85
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,599
uh we are assuming to compare two words

86
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,560
towards

87
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:32,480
these oh one concept but uh ideally you

88
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,840
know practically

89
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,920
to compare if the two strings are equal

90
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,239
that's going to take oven time so it's

91
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,959
actually one square okay

92
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,959
or n squared

93
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,920
now prefix is the same right it's the

94
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,360
same i have to do this uh

95
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,440
check one one

96
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,519
one and check if this is the prefix of

97
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,280
that right yeah and we're checking with

98
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,159
the prefix of that so that's going to

99
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,400
plug on square time as well

100
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,640
so how can we do this uh better using

101
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,720
the prefix tree so look everything this

102
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,000
is magic yeah this is the review how

103
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,879
come we do this

104
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,200
so we built a prefix tree so

105
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,760
so we go through this yeah we go through

106
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,320
this let's say okay this is the rule

107
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,959
there this is a tree previously

108
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,840
root empty here this is empty here and

109
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,720
then

110
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,360
okay

111
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:27,280
e i got e

112
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:29,840
yeah i got the r look

113
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,160
i got i

114
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,520
and i got the c

115
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,800
okay so

116
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:40,840
yeah just just by attending the letters

117
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:44,400
on the tree and r y a n

118
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:46,639
r y

119
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,639
a

120
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:53,040
and okay so at the end when it's

121
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:55,840
terminal notes when one list what

122
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,320
right when this node look because eric

123
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,960
this is a word boundary ending here so i

124
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,520
set this additional field to true

125
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,560
to true otherwise all other nodes are

126
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,320
false right and chessy again chesty

127
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,280
so c

128
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,720
yeah

129
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,320
h

130
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,600
e

131
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,440
s

132
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,800
s l y

133
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,240
l y

134
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,090
i'm pyro

135
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,400
okay p

136
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:22,639
[Music]

137
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,639
y

138
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,680
oh okay let's do another one maybe let's

139
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:32,440
put it like uh

140
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,639
like what every car okay

141
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,320
e-r-i-c-a every car

142
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,600
so look e

143
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:42,160
r i see and i put another a and then

144
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,320
this is also a what that means is true

145
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,919
and y n let's say

146
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:51,199
writing okay let's put another one

147
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:54,960
okay so r y a n and i put another white

148
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:56,960
here why you need okay so what look this

149
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,960
is the previous tree how does that have

150
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,440
okay let's say if i want to look up for

151
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,800
a word like uh

152
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,759
maybe

153
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,080
chest if a chest is a prefix from adding

154
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:11,840
words here so i can just do this

155
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,199
okay so look it has to try c i go here

156
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,080
h

157
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,560
e

158
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,919
s s okay fine look

159
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,120
it's here so

160
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:23,120
i can fall on the path so okay chess is

161
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:27,199
a is a prefix right

162
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:30,000
easy how about chair overlaps abc

163
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:33,120
it doesn't have a okay so i know

164
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:37,360
it's not prefix yeah

165
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,360
another example like uh chassis

166
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,080
okay so look c is there

167
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:45,039
h is there

168
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:47,520
e is there ss

169
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:49,759
okay but now this one doesn't have white

170
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,000
so we know the chassis is not part of

171
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,639
the original dictionary

172
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,479
yeah how cool is that right

173
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,919
yeah

174
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:03,520
makes sense so so how we process look we

175
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:06,560
possess these words in a in a list of

176
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,479
words we put it in the tree construct

177
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,240
the prefix tree which is called how do

178
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:12,000
you pronounce this by the way

179
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,360
try try

180
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,479
try okay

181
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,280
try

182
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:20,560
okay prefix tree okay so the time

183
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,400
complexity looked up to check if

184
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,199
to check if uh

185
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:28,639
okay okay to check if a word is in that

186
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:31,199
we is o n right n is the number of uh

187
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,759
the character in these right compared to

188
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:36,960
o n square right remember previously o n

189
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,880
squared because look linear search

190
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,520
n times for each one

191
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,520
in the worst case you need to compare

192
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,560
n times right

193
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:49,440
but now this is oven so it's the many we

194
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,919
are improving from ln to

195
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,160
om square to on and the space complexity

196
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,720
the previous one we haven't used any

197
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:59,599
space is a one right if we do a blue

198
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,520
force search but now we are using

199
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,360
addition a tree

200
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,440
right we're building this so what's the

201
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,520
term capacity of building this

202
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,840
is o n square right well if the each

203
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,840
word is n

204
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,599
and dense and they are inwards so that's

205
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,960
o n squared okay that's the space

206
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,360
complexity

207
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,520
all right i like to insert a word in

208
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,360
that it's easy as well look how do we

209
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,199
use a look let's say i want to insert

210
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,400
another one like uh

211
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:29,199
arrayed like okay without space how can

212
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:32,320
we insert this okay e is here so i don't

213
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:34,240
create it ah i see okay and then what

214
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,479
air it doesn't have air

215
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,919
so i put another air

216
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,279
okay

217
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,839
a

218
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:44,800
i remember when he finished here i need

219
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:47,440
to set this field t to true

220
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,760
right so next time i can just follow it

221
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,160
look this is you can call this like a

222
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,720
dictionary tree right so we we are

223
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,560
basically putting the words

224
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,399
yeah we're putting the words constructed

225
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,959
towards here

226
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,920
including the tree right so and this to

227
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,560
search

228
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,600
a prefix and search it it takes a long

229
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,519
time

230
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,279
okay so this is the

231
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,120
try yeah we talked about a long long

232
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,160
time ago yeah long long time ago

233
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,880
probably

234
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,560
i don't know in the first 100 days yeah

235
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,360
last year yeah

236
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,120
how does that help look if we

237
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,360
so now

238
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,760
okay so now i want to do this i want to

239
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,920
search something so i want to search if

240
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,720
i have a question mark here means that

241
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:33,440
it can replace any words so okay so can

242
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,240
you tell me if this is exist

243
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,399
e

244
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,120
question mark i see

245
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,680
if it is exists in in a word in in this

246
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,600
dictionary

247
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,800
now remember this is the thing any

248
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,800
single word

249
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,839
e something i see is it in the

250
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:52,560
dictionary yeah yeah because e i c okay

251
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,839
exactly how about how about

252
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,080
c

253
00:09:53,839 --> 00:10:00,399
question mark question mark e question

254
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,920
mark question mark is it in the in here

255
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:06,560
c

256
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:07,360
c question mark yeah question mark

257
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,560
no

258
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,360
okay so it's not how about

259
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,680
c

260
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,120
question mark uh question mark question

261
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,000
mark

262
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,120
see

263
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,120
yeah question mark

264
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,880
okay so how can we do this what's your

265
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,600
song

266
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,640
obviously we still need to feel like

267
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,640
pillar

268
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,160
we still need to build it right

269
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,720
yeah we still need to build this

270
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:39,200
dictionary tree but how can we do this

271
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,880
when we meet a question mark

272
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,360
okay so let's say we want to meet a

273
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,519
question mark we don't care

274
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,839
that's good we don't care how do we not

275
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,839
care

276
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:55,040
it could be any good good point so let's

277
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:58,079
say look if a tree i'm here right and if

278
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:00,560
i made this letter and the next letter

279
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:02,079
this is the dictionary right this is the

280
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,320
dictionary

281
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,120
yeah this is a tree oh look it's a tree

282
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,680
right

283
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,680
so here

284
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,720
the next letter is question mark right

285
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,720
look this is for example this is

286
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,000
a for example and the next letter is

287
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,079
question mark

288
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,800
so all i want to do is that there are

289
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:24,399
four possibilities right so i can prove

290
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:28,880
first i can try each possibilities

291
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:32,240
yeah so that this is a word like uh

292
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:36,000
let's taken this e i c for example right

293
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,600
e something i c right so now

294
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,399
unfortunately

295
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,360
yeah

296
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,360
yeah question mark means any letter so

297
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:47,279
look if i try this

298
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:49,839
e okay it matches but the next one

299
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:53,519
is any number right and any characters

300
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,839
right so let's put another one maybe e x

301
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,279
a b

302
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:00,079
e q

303
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:02,240
c d okay i don't know e x a b

304
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:04,639
x

305
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,040
a b here there's so many

306
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,480
things attached to my name yeah yeah

307
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:12,240
look at e

308
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:14,880
e q c d okay

309
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,200
okay and then look so now i'm here the

310
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:20,000
next next character could be anything so

311
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,760
there are three choices which is qri

312
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,160
right it doesn't matter because the this

313
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:27,040
one matches any so it could be this one

314
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,440
so i how about if i try q

315
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:32,240
q then the next letter i need to start

316
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:36,160
with i see now i need to match

317
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:38,720
match if these are ic right or i choose

318
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,800
here i need to max the match this is

319
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,760
should be ic or match here should be i

320
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,639
see right

321
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:47,680
yeah so i just pull for all the children

322
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,639
and i can do this therefore search

323
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,959
yeah

324
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,720
i can just do this definition okay so

325
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,000
let's quickly rewrite it okay it makes

326
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,800
sense

327
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,959
yeah

328
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,720
okay so let's repeat again this is the

329
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,040
letter we are currently at and the next

330
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:04,720
letter is a question mark and all i have

331
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:07,279
to do is take the kids of this in a try

332
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,440
in the track and then blue forcing it

333
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,800
blue funky and how can you improve first

334
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,320
thing

335
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,680
definite search we do the different

336
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,560
search

337
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,000
yeah

338
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:21,279
and then look e r e something i see then

339
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,200
look e if i take if i try this part

340
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:26,079
this is this can be

341
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,920
this can match to a single uh

342
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:30,160
single question mark

343
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:32,560
and all i have to do is follow the path

344
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,200
to see if the next few characters

345
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:38,320
matches i see right

346
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,880
again here i take this rule the next few

347
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,279
characters should match ic

348
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,600
and x the next character should be

349
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,360
should match i see here right

350
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,560
yeah

351
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,560
okay so now

352
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:58,000
quickly let's quickly light the try okay

353
00:13:53,600 --> 00:14:00,480
how can we write a try easy very easy

354
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,639
okay let's review a little bit

355
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,560
class normally we define a try in a

356
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,040
class we have to try

357
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:11,440
this is object

358
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:15,040
and then define constructor init

359
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:18,880
init init init cell

360
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:21,040
right so usually you can say self.

361
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,279
let's say words

362
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,720
is a dictionary right dictionary with

363
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,360
empty dictionary

364
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:30,720
and self don't leave is leave is what

365
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,000
let's say it's e or equals okay

366
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,760
okay

367
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,880
right

368
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,040
now

369
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,519
now i have to do this insert okay let's

370
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,120
do this in the inside and then the rest

371
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,600
will be distinctive inside i want to

372
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,079
insert a word in this in a try right you

373
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,160
know instead of what so

374
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:50,240
so first of all i get the root blue the

375
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,959
equals set

376
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:56,560
right so i'm going to say for

377
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:58,399
w in word i go through the characters by

378
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:01,680
character in this world i want to insert

379
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:03,760
look i want to insert this eric in in uh

380
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,920
i want to insert this eric in the try

381
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,720
right so now currently this is empty i

382
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,839
want to use the array so now i have to

383
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:15,680
check what

384
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:19,199
if w e is not in

385
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:21,600
blue dot word right but what

386
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,800
then i have to create a note in it so

387
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,279
loo

388
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:28,399
dot words

389
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:31,120
all right so the words w

390
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:33,680
equals try right

391
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,480
and then i i need to walk through so now

392
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,240
i create a word which is e here

393
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,199
here and then i need to walk through

394
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,199
that blue

395
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,880
right

396
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,519
and then

397
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:52,000
i keep doing this until

398
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:55,920
until the end when we reach reach the

399
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,600
end eic i need to set this to true so lu

400
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:01,519
da is leave

401
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:03,120
is leave is what is what it was true

402
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,519
right

403
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,040
yeah so this is the magic right this is

404
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,399
the magic if

405
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:12,639
if not in if this character if this

406
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:15,680
character we haven't got a character for

407
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:18,560
this then we create it and we put it we

408
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:21,279
put it in the try right and what we

409
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,120
work with okay so

410
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:26,160
so what does this do here

411
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,560
i go through e okay e is not here so i

412
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:31,680
create the e i work through it

413
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:35,600
okay r is not here so i created r one

414
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:38,000
three i i created i was three c i work

415
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,920
through it and then i send this to true

416
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,560
okay so for example if i have another

417
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:45,199
one e r and b okay

418
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,959
okay e is there so i just watch it i

419
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:49,519
don't i don't create it

420
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,480
r is there i don't create it a is not

421
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,279
there

422
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,279
i create it i'm not jump to it

423
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:58,000
b is not there

424
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,519
b and that's a little true make sense

425
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,079
yeah

426
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:05,439
insert let's to insert insert a word

427
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:06,720
into the chart okay time complexity this

428
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,400
is n

429
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,760
if there are n characters in the world

430
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,919
and o n

431
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,319
right the space complexity we're not

432
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,160
talking about space here because the tri

433
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:18,480
uses you know

434
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,319
is already thinking space there right so

435
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,000
there's no additional space in this

436
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:24,959
method okay

437
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,160
okay now the next word will be search if

438
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,840
we search it yeah if we search

439
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,400
search easy

440
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,960
if not in left then i need to return

441
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,520
false right easy if not in that i return

442
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,799
false otherwise return true

443
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,200
right

444
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:44,720
and then look if we search entire word i

445
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,960
can do this i can say okay return

446
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,720
return blue dot is leave right because

447
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,760
it has to be

448
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:54,000
it is what it has to be exactly match

449
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,720
but if i search a prefix look if i

450
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,160
search it with the prefix

451
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,679
prefix then i just need to return true

452
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,799
make sense

453
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,679
yeah

454
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:07,919
so each word is isn't

455
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:10,960
awake ryan what you doing

456
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:14,000
it's what what is warming

457
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:17,039
it means it's not this note if there's a

458
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,039
word ending here like eic right for

459
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:21,039
example i

460
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:23,919
the field is is word

461
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:26,880
is false because there's no word there's

462
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:30,240
no such word ending here right but yeah

463
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:32,000
i see there's actually a word

464
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,559
ending here so we send it to true this

465
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,960
field so such prefix will return true

466
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:40,320
but search what we need to return

467
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,320
that rule the note

468
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,039
is what equals true okay

469
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,280
ryan what did you say

470
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,280
right

471
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:53,280
okay now okay now let's do this step for

472
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,520
search bit okay easy

473
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,280
that's a search it's quite similar so we

474
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,000
we just have to

475
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,880
to

476
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,640
to

477
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,520
define we have to

478
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:06,559
search okay this search

479
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,640
please uh also have these words but this

480
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:11,200
word

481
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,360
can have a

482
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,840
question mark meaning it could match any

483
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,840
character okay so now most part is

484
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:21,600
similar rule dot self

485
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:23,679
and i go through this for w in

486
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,720
word okay i go through this is what okay

487
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:28,559
now look if w equal

488
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,799
question mark okay

489
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:33,440
yeah if this is a question mark so what

490
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:35,280
do we do okay so let's let's skip this

491
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,960
for a moment

492
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:40,400
as

493
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:43,280
if we know question mark if if what if

494
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,840
if w not in

495
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,440
root of one right

496
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,400
this is the same yeah now we return

497
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:52,320
false right yeah

498
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,760
if it's not a question mark and if it's

499
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,559
not in

500
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:58,240
in the in the next note right then

501
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,160
we return false because it's not

502
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,400
matching any

503
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:05,200
any prefix right

504
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,480
now i have to do this load equals i go

505
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,960
to next

506
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,200
kit yeah i go to the kit

507
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,559
do the word

508
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,799
w okay

509
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:17,919
and then we can

510
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:19,679
return true or if we want to match

511
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,520
exactly then we do potentially if we

512
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,520
don't want to match exactly we return

513
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,120
low dot is leave

514
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,159
that is what

515
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,840
we imagine matching the prefix right so

516
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:33,120
now look

517
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:35,280
if word equals question mark then i have

518
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:38,559
to do what i have to

519
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:40,159
i have to go through for the kids for n

520
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:43,520
in

521
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,520
in what in do

522
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,480
words okay now i have to go through the

523
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,440
keys now the kids what

524
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,919
if

525
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,120
search okay this is a search

526
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,960
search work

527
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:01,840
search anything such these uh

528
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,280
these things will be look

529
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,240
okay e

530
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:08,640
question mark i see right

531
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:12,159
so now i'm a question mark i have to try

532
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:14,799
each n each end search each n and then

533
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,799
go through

534
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:20,720
the uh

535
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:24,640
go to what i have to go through

536
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:27,280
the next one look there will be e

537
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,039
there will be a few right a few and then

538
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,919
this is a question mark right this is

539
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:34,400
question mark so i would go to try each

540
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,679
one to see if matches this this part

541
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,799
okay

542
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,679
yeah

543
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:42,400
so how can we write it so

544
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:44,480
i have to actually use the i index i

545
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,120
need to go through the index so that

546
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,159
would be enumerate enumerate give us the

547
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,760
index and

548
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,880
the value

549
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:56,159
index level right if w equals that and

550
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,200
then i have to do this i have to do the

551
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,280
word

552
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,640
from

553
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,960
from i

554
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,799
plus one

555
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,679
right to the end i want to search this

556
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,000
one

557
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,000
right

558
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:15,520
so i have to search this one yes

559
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:17,440
okay so i have to i have to

560
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,919
give uh

561
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,880
give a place give a loot here

562
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:24,080
right

563
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:27,679
so look do this to say where to start

564
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:31,039
okay if not loot

565
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:33,120
then load equal self okay so i tell you

566
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:35,679
what's happening here so search this

567
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,240
word and i have to go through that start

568
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,360
from the next one so you'll be

569
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,559
uh

570
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:44,640
you'll be what

571
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:44,640
do dog words

572
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,480
n

573
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,760
uh rule the words n that's it's kit

574
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,520
right

575
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,960
and then if you like that then we can

576
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,240
true

577
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,880
if one of it

578
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:01,600
is there if one of the paths matches

579
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:04,159
return to otherwise we can form

580
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,200
okay this is the logic here

581
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,840
okay

582
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,679
yeah

583
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:11,120
so okay so let's review this a little

584
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:14,240
bit okay

585
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:16,799
the no we we are passing extra parameter

586
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:19,440
to say where where is the

587
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,480
try which node to start looking for

588
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,039
right

589
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,200
before we start with the loot with

590
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:28,320
everything with everything in the top

591
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:30,880
now because we we have this question

592
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:33,520
mark so we have the matches but we have

593
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:36,960
matches if this is matches

594
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:39,120
if because this match any character then

595
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:43,120
look what happened look this matches any

596
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:44,559
character i see so i i want to match ic

597
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,039
in

598
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:51,120
in what here

599
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:54,400
here here right

600
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:56,480
so i want to match ic where here

601
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,360
in this level right

602
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,720
right

603
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:02,559
so this level which one is this level

604
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,440
it's the next level so i have to pass

605
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:06,640
here

606
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,080
right i see this this level matches

607
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,919
question marks

608
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,679
if this match is the question market and

609
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,400
that goes through all these kits

610
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:16,400
everything matches

611
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,799
with every yeah question mark

612
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,840
matches one single characters okay with

613
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:23,440
everything yeah with the one character

614
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,919
let's just double check a little bit

615
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:29,559
just to make sure

616
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:29,559
it's all right okay

617
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,799
yeah so look if for

618
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,320
for if if this is the question mark and

619
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:42,799
then we go to

620
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:45,600
uh we go through the loop dot

621
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:48,000
words okay rule of words and then we

622
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:51,039
need to go to the next character look at

623
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,159
this is i i i plus 1 to the n will be

624
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,559
this one

625
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:59,840
yeah and then we search if the root of

626
00:24:54,559 --> 00:25:04,320
theta alluded was a right and if it is

627
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:06,880
a is a is this one and do dot

628
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,480
dot word a would be its kit so you'll be

629
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,360
this one right

630
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,039
yeah

631
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:14,760
and then you've learned you become true

632
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:14,760
okay uh

633
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:24,159
[Music]

634
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:26,080
okay so yeah

635
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:29,840
okay so if we

636
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,840
i think this is it

637
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,640
any questions any questions i mean this

638
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:38,240
is a little bit tricky yeah

639
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,240
is it we are using the tesla set

640
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:42,320
yeah

641
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,159
okay so what's what's special about this

642
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:47,039
one is here

643
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,760
yeah this bit okay let me do it again

644
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:49,760
look

645
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,880
previously if if we don't have this

646
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,880
question mark

647
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,559
right so we don't need to do this loot

648
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,400
will be cell

649
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,679
now we're passing this mood we are

650
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,919
telling

651
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:02,400
the search function to say where to

652
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:04,320
start okay so look this is a trial this

653
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:07,200
is a try somewhere

654
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:11,039
a try i try it's a previous tree right

655
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:12,080
it's a prefix tree

656
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,159
okay

657
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:17,840
so now

658
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:19,360
if i'm saying if i'm saying okay

659
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,760
the second letter

660
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:23,760
is a question mark right it's a question

661
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,919
mark

662
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:28,320
so you could match look at this this

663
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:31,200
first one is e the second letter is

664
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,960
question mark then i can try each part

665
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:37,279
i can try each part

666
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:39,840
but look this is e question mark i see

667
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:41,279
right question my ic then this is the

668
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,360
second letter

669
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:45,919
right and i want to match what the third

670
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,840
letter to the end which is i plus one

671
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,520
right but where to match i'm not

672
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,360
matching it from the start right it

673
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,559
doesn't make sense if i go back to the

674
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,720
root

675
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,000
so i have to match it

676
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,720
here

677
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,720
the children the subtree

678
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,279
of this question mark the sub tree of

679
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,520
the expression map make sense

680
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:08,640
yeah so that's why i put these loot of

681
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:10,799
words n which is here here here here and

682
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,440
if one of these matches well this is

683
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:15,600
just do a normal search if one of these

684
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,679
match matches

685
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:21,360
and then

686
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:23,039
okay so actually look you could the next

687
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:25,200
next one could have another question

688
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:27,039
mark as well right if this is another

689
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,880
question mark what happened

690
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:30,320
then okay the third one is also question

691
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,360
mark right

692
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:36,159
right so so what happened

693
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,760
this could be question mark again and

694
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:40,320
then i have to do this we have to do

695
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,840
this again if one of them follow if one

696
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,840
element has the

697
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:46,840
has matched its perfect match with the

698
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:48,830
time to otherwise will return four right

699
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,320

728
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,840
and why

729
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:34,000

730
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,000
yeah

731
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:38,559
okay

732
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,559
t yeah

733
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,640
right you're getting this

734
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,720
right

735
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,720
you following this yeah

736
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,559
well done okay so let's say if i want to

737
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,960
look for like

738
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:53,200
every car can you simulate the process

739
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,279
of everything there

740
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,320
every car

741
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:59,350
so

742
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:01,120
we got e

743
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:02,799
[Music]

744
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:06,120
okay

745
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:06,120
this is

746
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,720
depending if you're looking for prefix

747
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:24,320
if you're looking for prefix

748
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,960
then we just return true if you're

749
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:29,200
looking for exact match we need to check

750
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,000
if there's a t there right

751
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,440
yeah

752
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,320
make sense

753
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,399
yeah if if we're looking for the prefix

754
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,399
we don't care if there's t

755
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:40,480
if we're looking at match exact match we

756
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:42,000
need to find even t

757
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,360
make sense

758
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:48,679
okay

759
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:48,679
that's it for today bye bye bye bye

760
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:54,039
