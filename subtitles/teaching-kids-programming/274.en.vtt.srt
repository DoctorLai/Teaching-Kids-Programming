yes okay so
we have what's fine entry

6
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:07,440
we have what's fine entry
 

7
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,190
we have what's fine entry
well

8
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:09,200
well
 

9
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,589
well
five let's say five six one is it a

10
00:00:11,589 --> 00:00:11,599
five let's say five six one is it a
 

11
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:12,870
five let's say five six one is it a
binary

12
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:12,880
binary
 

13
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,470
binary
yes okay is this a pregnancy

14
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:16,480
yes okay is this a pregnancy
 

15
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,630
yes okay is this a pregnancy
no okay it doesn't have cycles yeah it

16
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:18,640
no okay it doesn't have cycles yeah it
 

17
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,310
no okay it doesn't have cycles yeah it
doesn't have a cycle there

18
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:20,320
doesn't have a cycle there
 

19
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,550
doesn't have a cycle there
well what's dng by the way remember we

20
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:22,560
well what's dng by the way remember we
 

21
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,990
well what's dng by the way remember we
talked about this

22
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:24,000
talked about this
 

23
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,910
talked about this
direction

24
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:25,920
direction
 

25
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,429
direction
directive a

26
00:00:27,429 --> 00:00:27,439
directive a
 

27
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,390
directive a
cyclic lock okay so look if i have this

28
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:30,400
cyclic lock okay so look if i have this
 

29
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,990
cyclic lock okay so look if i have this
one to two

30
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:32,000
one to two
 

31
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,830
one to two
and two to three it has in this

32
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:33,840
and two to three it has in this
 

33
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,750
and two to three it has in this
direction but it doesn't form cycle and

34
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:35,760
direction but it doesn't form cycle and
 

35
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,910
direction but it doesn't form cycle and
how well is if i point point here does

36
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:37,920
how well is if i point point here does
 

37
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,190
how well is if i point point here does
it have tigers

38
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:39,200
it have tigers
 

39
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,830
it have tigers
one two yeah yeah you can say so we talk

40
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:41,840
one two yeah yeah you can say so we talk
 

41
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,470
one two yeah yeah you can say so we talk
about the binary tree

42
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:44,480
about the binary tree
 

43
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,110
about the binary tree
so how many subtrees are there how many

44
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:47,120
so how many subtrees are there how many
 

45
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,549
so how many subtrees are there how many
subtrees are there what's subject um

46
00:00:50,549 --> 00:00:50,559
subtrees are there what's subject um
 

47
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,389
subtrees are there what's subject um
oh there are three what are else

48
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:54,399
oh there are three what are else
 

49
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,590
oh there are three what are else

what's the average how do we calculate

56
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:03,600
what's the average how do we calculate
 

57
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,610

good job
given the binary tree we want to find

82
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:30,479
given the binary tree we want to find
 

83
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:31,429
given the binary tree we want to find
out the

84
00:01:31,429 --> 00:01:31,439
out the
 

85
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,230
out the
maximum subtree average we want to know

maximum subtree average we want to know
 

87
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,109
maximum subtree average we want to know
this maximum substrate average

88
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:37,119
this maximum substrate average
 

89
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,270
this maximum substrate average
which is which one

90
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:39,280
which is which one
 

91
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,350
which is which one
which is which one come on which value

92
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:41,360
which is which one come on which value
 

93
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,109
which is which one come on which value
is it what's this

94
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:43,119
is it what's this
 

95
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,910
is it what's this
four yeah which one is bigger six yeah

96
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:45,920
four yeah which one is bigger six yeah
 

97
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,990
four yeah which one is bigger six yeah
so we find out that

98
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:48,000
so we find out that
 

99
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,030
so we find out that
okay okay so

100
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:51,040
okay okay so
 

101
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,950
okay okay so
do you still remember how we calculate

102
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:52,960
do you still remember how we calculate
 

103
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,429
do you still remember how we calculate
the sum of uh the sum first of all we

104
00:01:55,429 --> 00:01:55,439
the sum of uh the sum first of all we
 

105
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,310
the sum of uh the sum first of all we
want to know the sum of of the sub tree

106
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:58,320
want to know the sum of of the sub tree
 

107
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,109
want to know the sum of of the sub tree
sub sub tree of three yeah final three

108
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:01,119
sub sub tree of three yeah final three
 

109
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,469
sub sub tree of three yeah final three
sub uh binary energy

110
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:04,479
sub uh binary energy
 

111
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,949
sub uh binary energy
we will use the recursion remember

112
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:08,959

and first of all we need to for the
 

117
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,949

you can use the dq or the the simplest
 

163
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,030
you can use the dq or the the simplest
one i mean or you can use the notebook

164
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,040
one i mean or you can use the notebook
 

165
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,790
one i mean or you can use the notebook
but i'm talking about starting just put

166
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:08,800
but i'm talking about starting just put
 

167
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,630
but i'm talking about starting just put
two numbers together just return instead

168
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:10,640
two numbers together just return instead
 

169
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,070
two numbers together just return instead
of writing one number i want to return

170
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:12,080
of writing one number i want to return
 

171
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,990
of writing one number i want to return
two numbers come on

172
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,000
two numbers come on
 

173
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,670
two numbers come on
wait is it

174
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:15,680
wait is it
 

175
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,869
wait is it
people

176
00:03:16,869 --> 00:03:16,879
people
 

177
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,110
people
yeah this is this this is okay what's

178
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:19,120
yeah this is this this is okay what's
 

179
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,309
yeah this is this this is okay what's
tupa

180
00:03:20,309 --> 00:03:20,319
tupa
 

181
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,509

this yeah

188
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:28,959
this yeah
 

189
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,710
this yeah
okay so not the way

190
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:30,720
okay so not the way
 

191
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,030
okay so not the way
even two numbers the first one is the

192
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,040
even two numbers the first one is the
 

193
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,949
even two numbers the first one is the
sum the second one is the count right

194
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:34,959
sum the second one is the count right
 

195
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,949
sum the second one is the count right
this makes sense if it's empty we return

196
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:36,959
this makes sense if it's empty we return
 

197
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:37,910
this makes sense if it's empty we return
nothing

198
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:37,920
nothing
 

199
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,830
nothing
there's no vertex there's no note okay

200
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:41,840
there's no vertex there's no note okay
 

201
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,309
there's no vertex there's no note okay
okay so in order to calculate the sum of

202
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:44,319
okay so in order to calculate the sum of
 

203
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,030
okay so in order to calculate the sum of
the

204
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,040
the
 

205
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,670
the
the sum and the count for this for this

206
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:47,680
the sum and the count for this for this
 

207
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,350
the sum and the count for this for this
function we want to return two things

208
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:49,360
function we want to return two things
 

209
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,030
function we want to return two things
one is the sum

210
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:51,040
one is the sum
 

211
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,789
one is the sum
one is the sum the other one is the

212
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:52,799
one is the sum the other one is the
 

213
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,390
one is the sum the other one is the
count right

214
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:54,400
count right
 

215
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,630
count right
so look if this is the root

216
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:56,640
so look if this is the root
 

217
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,869
so look if this is the root
and if i i have some tree here i don't

218
00:03:58,869 --> 00:03:58,879
and if i i have some tree here i don't
 

219
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,470
and if i i have some tree here i don't
care and i have some tree here i don't

220
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:00,480
care and i have some tree here i don't
 

221
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,030
care and i have some tree here i don't
care which is this is to do the left

222
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,040
care which is this is to do the left
 

223
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,550
care which is this is to do the left
and this is noodle right

224
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:06,560

 

225
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,190

so how do we solve these two how to get

226
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:09,200
so how do we solve these two how to get
 

227
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,949
so how do we solve these two how to get
a together

228
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:10,959
a together
 

229
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,429
a together
yeah recursion that's what we call so

230
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:13,439
yeah recursion that's what we call so
 

231
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,150
yeah recursion that's what we call so
first of all we want to say some

232
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:16,160
first of all we want to say some
 

233
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,830
first of all we want to say some
left

234
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:17,840
left
 

235
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,909
left
and look because it returned two number

236
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:19,919
and look because it returned two number
 

237
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:21,909
and look because it returned two number
another count

238
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:21,919
another count
 

239
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:24,150
another count
count the left

240
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:24,160
count the left
 

241
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,610
count the left
equals definite search what

242
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:28,620

 

243
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:34,950

245
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,310

because we're calling itself we have to

246
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:36,320
because we're calling itself we have to
 

247
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,230
because we're calling itself we have to
return two values and then you can tell

248
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:38,240
return two values and then you can tell
 

249
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,350
return two values and then you can tell
me what was that sum what

250
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:41,360
me what was that sum what
 

251
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,230
me what was that sum what
right yeah i know what

252
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:44,240
right yeah i know what
 

253
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:51,749
right yeah i know what
come on

254

255
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,629

okay so now we have

256
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:54,639
okay so now we have
 

257
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,870
okay so now we have
we have less sum of left and we have a

258
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:56,880
we have less sum of left and we have a
 

259
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,270
we have less sum of left and we have a
sum of right we have a count of left we

260
00:04:59,270 --> 00:04:59,280
sum of right we have a count of left we
 

261
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,390
sum of right we have a count of left we
have count of right now what's the if i

262
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:02,400
have count of right now what's the if i
 

263
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,670
have count of right now what's the if i
put a

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,189
max average
equals max of what two things

340
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:35,199
equals max of what two things
 

341
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,670
equals max of what two things
that's f is equals to two things

yeah max average okay
 

359
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,589
yeah max average okay
and then we want to return return one as

360
00:06:57,589 --> 00:06:57,599
and then we want to return return one as
 

361
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:58,629
and then we want to return return one as
i said

362
00:06:58,629 --> 00:06:58,639
i said
 

363
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,870
i said
the first one is what

364
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:00,880

this is the sum this is the count so
 

369
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,510
this is the sum this is the count so
what do we return here

370
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:11,520
what do we return here
 

371
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,990
what do we return here
come on which one is the sum

372
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:14,000
come on which one is the sum
 

373
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,309
come on which one is the sum
which one is the sum the sum of these

374
00:07:16,309 --> 00:07:16,319
which one is the sum the sum of these
 

375
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,710
which one is the sum the sum of these
whole three dude which one is the sum is

376
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:18,720
whole three dude which one is the sum is
 

377
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,830
whole three dude which one is the sum is
there

378
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:19,840
there
 

379
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,790
there
well

380
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:20,800
well
 

381
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,110
well
it's there come on which one is the sum

382
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:23,120
it's there come on which one is the sum
 

383
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,390
it's there come on which one is the sum
count

384
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:24,400
count
 

385
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,589
count
which one is sum s look sum

386
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:27,599
which one is sum s look sum
 

387
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,350
which one is sum s look sum
and what's the second parameter c c easy

388
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:31,360
and what's the second parameter c c easy
 

389
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,230
and what's the second parameter c c easy
yeah so looking can you put them around

390
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:34,240
yeah so looking can you put them around
 

391
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,749
yeah so looking can you put them around
no because the

392
00:07:35,749 --> 00:07:35,759
no because the
 

393
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,749
no because the
because look if you put that around you

394
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:37,759
because look if you put that around you
 

395
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,909
because look if you put that around you
need to swap these two right you see

396
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:39,919
need to swap these two right you see
 

397
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,589
need to swap these two right you see
good point yeah but because therefore

398
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:41,599
good point yeah but because therefore
 

399
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,110
good point yeah but because therefore
search you call itself then you will

400
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:43,120
search you call itself then you will
 

401
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,550
search you call itself then you will
return to number

402
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:44,560
return to number
 

403
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,029
return to number
five we are assuming the first one is

404
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:47,039
five we are assuming the first one is
 

405
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,189
five we are assuming the first one is
the sum the second one is the count so

406
00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:49,199
the sum the second one is the count so
 

407
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,270
the sum the second one is the count so
that's why we put the sum left count

408
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:51,280
that's why we put the sum left count
 

409
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,830
that's why we put the sum left count
some left if i swap it if i swap it put

410
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:53,840
some left if i swap it if i swap it put
 

411
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,550
some left if i swap it if i swap it put
the c and s you can see and as what you

412
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:56,560
the c and s you can see and as what you
 

413
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,710
the c and s you can see and as what you
write what should we change

414
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:58,720
write what should we change
 

415
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,629
write what should we change
um some left with count left and some

416
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:02,639
um some left with count left and some
 

417
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,550
um some left with count left and some
so we need to swap these two count left

418
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:04,560
so we need to swap these two count left
 

419
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,670
so we need to swap these two count left
some left

420
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:05,680
some left
 

421
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,430
some left
count right some right right

422
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:07,440
count right some right right
 

423
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,430
count right some right right
yeah you see this is returning the tuple

424
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:09,440
yeah you see this is returning the tuple
 

425
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,309
yeah you see this is returning the tuple
and i i use this a b equal look what's

426
00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:12,319
and i i use this a b equal look what's
 

427
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,950
and i i use this a b equal look what's
it remember this syntax a dot b equals

428
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:14,960
it remember this syntax a dot b equals
 

429
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,629
it remember this syntax a dot b equals
two and three so what's a what's the

430
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:16,639
two and three so what's a what's the
 

431
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,710
two and three so what's a what's the
value of a what's the value of b

432
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:20,720

 

433
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,990

two a is two and b is three exactly yeah

434
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:24,000
two a is two and b is three exactly yeah
 

435
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,909
two a is two and b is three exactly yeah
you see exactly what's the term

436
00:08:25,909 --> 00:08:25,919
you see exactly what's the term
 

437
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:29,270
you see exactly what's the term
complexity

438
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:29,280

 

439
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,870

what's the space complexity

440
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:32,880

 

441
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,190

yeah we need to know the question using

442
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:35,200
yeah we need to know the question using
 

443
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,550
yeah we need to know the question using
the step okay

444
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:36,560
the step okay
 

445
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,880
the step okay
