hello hello
 

7
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,030
hello hello
hello mr mr ryan are you all right

8
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:07,040
hello mr mr ryan are you all right
 

9
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:07,909
hello mr mr ryan are you all right
yeah

10
00:00:07,909 --> 00:00:07,919
yeah
 

11
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,870
yeah
okay so we talked about the graph

12
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:10,880
okay so we talked about the graph
 

13
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,870
okay so we talked about the graph
the day before yesterday yeah the the

14
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:12,880
the day before yesterday yeah the the
 

15
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,950
the day before yesterday yeah the the
connectivity between the start and the

16
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:14,960
connectivity between the start and the
 

17
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,990
connectivity between the start and the
finish right okay eric that's it

18
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:18,000
finish right okay eric that's it
 

19
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,230
finish right okay eric that's it
the graph yeah by the direction of the

20
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:20,240
the graph yeah by the direction of the
 

21
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,990
the graph yeah by the direction of the
graph see it

22
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:22,000
graph see it
 

23
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,509
graph see it
that's okay

24
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:25,519

 

25
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,910

the graph what how can we represent a

26
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:27,920
the graph what how can we represent a
 

27
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,669
the graph what how can we represent a
graph that's it that's it how can we

28
00:00:29,669 --> 00:00:29,679
graph that's it that's it how can we
 

29
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,750
graph that's it that's it how can we
represent the graph

30
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:31,760
represent the graph
 

31
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,270
represent the graph
all right

32
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:35,280

 

33
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:35,990

what

34
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:36,000
what
 

35
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,470
what
what what do we represent the graph what

36
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:38,480
what what do we represent the graph what
 

37
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,150
what what do we represent the graph what
what letter are we using to do the graph

38
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:42,160
what letter are we using to do the graph
 

39
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,310
what letter are we using to do the graph
which graph

40
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:44,320
which graph
 

41
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,510
which graph
yeah

42
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:45,520
yeah
 

43
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,110
yeah
what does it contain

44
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:47,120
what does it contain
 

45
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,110
what does it contain
it contains

46
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:49,120
it contains
 

47
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,709
it contains
what's this eric what's this

48
00:00:52,709 --> 00:00:52,719
what's this eric what's this
 

49
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,670
what's this eric what's this
this is ashes and what's this

50
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:55,680
this is ashes and what's this
 

51
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,950
this is ashes and what's this
vertex vertex yes g we used uh it's a

52
00:00:58,950 --> 00:00:58,960
vertex vertex yes g we used uh it's a
 

53
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,910
vertex vertex yes g we used uh it's a
collection of vertex and edges okay

54
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:01,920
collection of vertex and edges okay
 

55
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,430
collection of vertex and edges okay
that's the graph

56
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:03,440
that's the graph
 

57
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,670
that's the graph
so we want to find out if there is a

58
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:05,680
so we want to find out if there is a
 

59
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,350
so we want to find out if there is a
connection if uh

60
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:07,360
connection if uh
 

61
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,510
connection if uh
if there's a path that it could lead to

62
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:09,520
if there's a path that it could lead to
 

63
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:20,410
if there's a path that it could lead to
the end we're done from

64
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:20,420

 

65
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:25,270

[Music]

66
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:25,280

 

67
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,109

we use the q and we also use the

68
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:27,119
we use the q and we also use the
 

69
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,510
we use the q and we also use the
notebook to remember the vertex we have

70
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:29,520
notebook to remember the vertex we have
 

71
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,270
notebook to remember the vertex we have
uh visited right

72
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:31,280
uh visited right
 

73
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,270
uh visited right
and then how do we represent the graph

74
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:33,280
and then how do we represent the graph
 

75
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,270
and then how do we represent the graph
we use the adjacent

76
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:35,280
we use the adjacent
 

77
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,789
we use the adjacent
linkage actually it's a change in

78
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:36,799
linkage actually it's a change in
 

79
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,390
linkage actually it's a change in
english

80
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:38,400
english
 

81
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,429
english
adjacent language

82
00:01:43,429 --> 00:01:43,439

 

83
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,030

what does that mean

84
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:45,040
what does that mean
 

85
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,950
what does that mean
yeah it's not adjacent metric

86
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:46,960
yeah it's not adjacent metric
 

87
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,789
yeah it's not adjacent metric
previously i made a mistake because it's

88
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:48,799
previously i made a mistake because it's
 

89
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,389
previously i made a mistake because it's
not adjacent material it's not just

90
00:01:50,389 --> 00:01:50,399
not adjacent material it's not just
 

91
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:51,830
not adjacent material it's not just
increased why is that how do we

92
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:51,840
increased why is that how do we
 

93
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,630
increased why is that how do we
represent this graph the key

94
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:54,640
represent this graph the key
 

95
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,670
represent this graph the key
the key key is the vertex right remember

96
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:57,680
the key key is the vertex right remember
 

97
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,310
the key key is the vertex right remember
so if it's one vertex one

98
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:00,320
so if it's one vertex one
 

99
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,709
so if it's one vertex one
and then the variable value is the list

100
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:02,719
and then the variable value is the list
 

101
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,429
and then the variable value is the list
of vertex you can connect to so what's

102
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:05,439
of vertex you can connect to so what's
 

103
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,429
of vertex you can connect to so what's
one what's here

104
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:07,439
one what's here
 

105
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,469
one what's here
one can connect to

106
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:10,479
one can connect to
 

107
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,270
one can connect to
a list of two two can connect to one and

108
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:13,280
a list of two two can connect to one and
 

109
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,150
a list of two two can connect to one and
three yeah one and three

110
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:16,160
three yeah one and three
 

111
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,309
three yeah one and three
three can connect to

112
00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:18,319
three can connect to
 

113
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,670
three can connect to
at least one

114
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:19,680
at least one
 

115
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,990
at least one
no no no it's just direct edges three

116
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,000
no no no it's just direct edges three
 

117
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,830
no no no it's just direct edges three
omega connectors and then four connect

118
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:23,840
omega connectors and then four connect
 

119
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,510
omega connectors and then four connect
two five

120
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:25,520
two five
 

121
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,070
two five
five and then five connectors

122
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:30,080

 

123
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,949

you see so these the keys are the vertex

124
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:32,959
you see so these the keys are the vertex
 

125
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,309
you see so these the keys are the vertex
and the

126
00:02:34,309 --> 00:02:34,319
and the
 

127
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,790
and the
values are the list of the vertex you

128
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:36,800
values are the list of the vertex you
 

129
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,030
values are the list of the vertex you
can get directly connected to

130
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,040
can get directly connected to
 

131
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,830
can get directly connected to
yeah

132
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:39,840
yeah
 

133
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,670
yeah
okay so that day we use the buffer

134
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:41,680
okay so that day we use the buffer
 

135
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,270
okay so that day we use the buffer
search you know today we're going to use

136
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:43,280
search you know today we're going to use
 

137
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,430
search you know today we're going to use
the default search okay yeah it's quite

138
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:45,440
the default search okay yeah it's quite
 

139
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,750
the default search okay yeah it's quite
similar we still need to

140
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:47,760
similar we still need to
 

141
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,350
similar we still need to
use the hash

142
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:49,360
use the hash
 

143
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,390
use the hash
a hashtag to remember the notes we have

144
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:52,400
a hashtag to remember the notes we have
 

145
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,550
a hashtag to remember the notes we have
visited so it doesn't

146
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:54,560
visited so it doesn't
 

147
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,710
visited so it doesn't
form a cycle look if if i read it too

148
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:58,720
form a cycle look if if i read it too
 

149
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,350
form a cycle look if if i read it too
if i come from one and visit two right i

150
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:01,360
if i come from one and visit two right i
 

151
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,630
if i come from one and visit two right i
should i visit one again

152
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:04,640
should i visit one again
 

153
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,790
should i visit one again
do i need to visit one again no right

154
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:06,800
do i need to visit one again no right
 

155
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,270
do i need to visit one again no right
because if i go back to one will happen

156
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:09,280
because if i go back to one will happen
 

157
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,949
because if i go back to one will happen
then you'll go to the two again and go

158
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:10,959
then you'll go to the two again and go
 

159
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,869
then you'll go to the two again and go
to one and then go to two again so you

160
00:03:12,869 --> 00:03:12,879
to one and then go to two again so you
 

161
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,149
to one and then go to two again so you
will do this endlessly right yeah

162
00:03:16,149 --> 00:03:16,159
will do this endlessly right yeah
 

163
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,550
will do this endlessly right yeah
why would you choose one

164
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:18,560
why would you choose one
 

165
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,869
why would you choose one
because one is also connected to two

166
00:03:20,869 --> 00:03:20,879
because one is also connected to two
 

167
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,869
because one is also connected to two
right it's a by direction why don't they

168
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:22,879
right it's a by direction why don't they
 

169
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,390
right it's a by direction why don't they
g3

yeah okay so today we talked about
 

185
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,869
yeah okay so today we talked about
deficits how how are we usually

186
00:03:40,869 --> 00:03:40,879
deficits how how are we usually
 

187
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,190
deficits how how are we usually
implementing the deficit

188
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:43,200
implementing the deficit
 

189
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,190
implementing the deficit
oh we're usually implementing the type

190
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:45,200
oh we're usually implementing the type
 

191
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,070
oh we're usually implementing the type
of search what's that for search

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,150
look this is x this is e remember the
bi-directional if x can go to e then you

the trees trees are directional graph

274

the trees trees are directional graph
 

275
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,029
the trees trees are directional graph
why is that

276
00:05:57,029 --> 00:05:57,039
why is that
 

277
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,189
why is that
look this is a tree

278
00:05:59,189 --> 00:05:59,199
look this is a tree
 

279
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,590
look this is a tree
why is that

280
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:01,600
why is that
 

281
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,590
why is that
it's actually look at the gra the trees

282
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:03,600
it's actually look at the gra the trees
 

283
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,350
it's actually look at the gra the trees
we talked about right it's actually

we talked about right it's actually
 

285
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,909
we talked about right it's actually
directional why is that because look you

286
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:07,919
directional why is that because look you
 

287
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,230
directional why is that because look you
cannot go to the parent

288
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:10,240
cannot go to the parent
 

289
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,070
cannot go to the parent
for usually you cannot go to the parents

290
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:12,080
for usually you cannot go to the parents
 

291
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,070
for usually you cannot go to the parents
from the kids right early so it's a

292
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,080
from the kids right early so it's a
 

293
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,230
from the kids right early so it's a
direction from parent to girl to the

294
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:16,240
direction from parent to girl to the
 

295
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,550

297
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,950

directional right but now we are talking

298
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:22,960
directional right but now we are talking
 

299
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,350
directional right but now we are talking
about bi-directional all

300
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:25,360
about bi-directional all
 

301
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,230

and directional yeah and direction
 

303
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,469
and directional yeah and direction
and direction okay all right this makes

304
00:06:30,469 --> 00:06:30,479
and direction okay all right this makes
 

305
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:31,430
and direction okay all right this makes

00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,870
first of all we need to remember have a
set equal set

320

set equal set
 

321
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,590
set equal set
this is to remember the notes the vertex

322
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:47,600
this is to remember the notes the vertex
 

323
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,589
this is to remember the notes the vertex
we have visited right yeah so we don't

324
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:49,599
we have visited right yeah so we don't
 

325
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,350

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,430
star we start with the star to the end
right so what does this mean we want to

342
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:09,440
right so what does this mean we want to
 

343
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,150
right so what does this mean we want to
find out if there's a path between s to

344
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:12,160
find out if there's a path between s to
 

345
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,270
find out if there's a path between s to
e right

346
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:13,280
e right
 

347
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,150
e right
i know what it will do if s equals e

348
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:16,160
i know what it will do if s equals e
 

349
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,390
i know what it will do if s equals e
what should we return

350
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:18,400
what should we return
 

351
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,670
what should we return
we this is the base cases

352
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:21,680
we this is the base cases
 

353
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,830
we this is the base cases
because look

354
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:23,840
because look
 

355
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,629
because look
at s

356
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:26,639

 

357
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:27,430

yeah
return to where yes we're done because c

362
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:31,360
return to where yes we're done because c
 

363
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,430
return to where yes we're done because c
c is the number of nodes we visited we

364
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:33,440
c is the number of nodes we visited we
 

365
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,350
c is the number of nodes we visited we
are currently at s so we need to put it

366
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:35,360
are currently at s so we need to put it
 

367
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,629
are currently at s so we need to put it
at here yeah

368
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:36,639

s this is a set yeah and s
 

373
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,230
s this is a set yeah and s
and now what should we do now we should

374
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:42,240
and now what should we do now we should
 

375
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,629
and now what should we do now we should
iterate over the nodes

376
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:44,639
iterate over the nodes
 

377
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,629
iterate over the nodes
that the gs right

378
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:46,639
that the gs right
 

379
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,749
that the gs right
wait okay so if i'm at s

380
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:49,759
wait okay so if i'm at s
 

381
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,070
wait okay so if i'm at s
where what are the nodes like what are

382
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,080
where what are the nodes like what are
 

383
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,189
where what are the nodes like what are
the vertices

384
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:55,199

 

385
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,830

for okay can you listen to me okay we

00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:57,840
for okay can you listen to me okay we
 

387
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,390
for okay can you listen to me okay we
are at current no the vertex s what are

388
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:00,400
are at current no the vertex s what are
 

389
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,110
are at current no the vertex s what are
the nodes where can we assess the list

390
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:03,120
the nodes where can we assess the list
 

391
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,270
the nodes where can we assess the list
of nodes that the s connects to

392
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:07,280
of nodes that the s connects to
 

393
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,350
of nodes that the s connects to
remember this is s and then it connects

394
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:09,360
remember this is s and then it connects
 

395
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,550
remember this is s and then it connects
to a few nodes so how can we access it

396
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:12,560
to a few nodes so how can we access it
 

397
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,029
to a few nodes so how can we access it
where do we edit

398
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:15,039
where do we edit
 

399
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,629
where do we edit
where where are the

where is the graph g

404
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:21,520
where is the graph g
 

405
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,070
where is the graph g
yes yeah that's the okay so we go sooner

406
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:24,080
yes yeah that's the okay so we go sooner
 

407
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:37,899
yes yeah that's the okay so we go sooner

look everything this is like oh yeah
 

419
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,150
look everything this is like oh yeah
so first of all we need to check if we

420
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:50,160
so first of all we need to check if we
 

421
00:08:50,160 --> 00:09:01,269
so first of all we need to check if we
have seen this eye before right

calling itself to find out
 

443
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:46,310
calling itself to find out
what are the two parameters here um

444
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:46,320

 

445
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,310

why is

446
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:50,320

 

447
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,829

i well because the eye is s connects to

448
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:53,839
i well because the eye is s connects to
 

449
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,670
i well because the eye is s connects to
look right

450
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:55,680
look right
 

451
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,110
look right
listen

452
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,120
listen
 

453
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,030
listen
e is somewhere here right i don't know

454
00:09:59,030 --> 00:09:59,040
e is somewhere here right i don't know
 

455
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,069
e is somewhere here right i don't know
right but look s the next note is i

456
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:02,079
right but look s the next note is i
 

457
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,110
right but look s the next note is i
right i know x can go to i and i want to

458
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:05,120
right i know x can go to i and i want to
 

459
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,509
right i know x can go to i and i want to
find out if i can go to e right if i can

460
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:07,519
find out if i can go to e right if i can
 

461
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:08,949
find out if i can go to e right if i can
go to e

462
00:10:08,949 --> 00:10:08,959
go to e
 

463
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,670
go to e
then i know s can go to u all right

464
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:11,680
then i know s can go to u all right
 

465
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,990
then i know s can go to u all right
simple as that right so but we have to

466
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:14,000
simple as that right so but we have to
 

467
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,310
simple as that right so but we have to
check if i is not in the scene right we

468
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:16,320
check if i is not in the scene right we
 

469
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,310
check if i is not in the scene right we
want to make sure we don't visit this i

470
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:18,320
want to make sure we don't visit this i
 

471
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,069
want to make sure we don't visit this i
over and over again right

472
00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:20,079
over and over again right
 

473
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,110
over and over again right
so if i not in c and then we can if if

474
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:23,120
so if i not in c and then we can if if
 

475
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,750
so if i not in c and then we can if if
we find out that i can be connected

476
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:25,760
we find out that i can be connected
 

477
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,910
we find out that i can be connected
there's a path between i and e

478
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:27,920
there's a path between i and e
 

479
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,590
there's a path between i and e
what does it mean

480
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:29,600
what does it mean
 

481
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,350
what does it mean
a

482
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:31,360
a
 

483
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,710
a
that is true

484
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:32,720
that is true
 

485
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,069
that is true
yeah look

486
00:10:34,069 --> 00:10:34,079
yeah look
 

487
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,590
yeah look
i what's i

488
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:35,600
i what's i
 

489
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,150
i what's i
s there is a path between s to i right

490
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:38,160
s there is a path between s to i right
 

491
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,069
s there is a path between s to i right
all right all right because s is

492
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:40,079
all right all right because s is
 

493
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,470
all right all right because s is
connected to i and then there is a path

494
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:42,480
connected to i and then there is a path
 

495
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,150
connected to i and then there is a path
between i to e what does it mean the

496
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:44,160
between i to e what does it mean the
 

497
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,509
between i to e what does it mean the
connectivity

498
00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:45,519
connectivity
 

499
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,150
connectivity
s can go to i i can go to e so what does

500
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:48,160
s can go to i i can go to e so what does
 

501
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,509
s can go to i i can go to e so what does
it mean

502
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:51,519

 

503
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,670

s can go to i i can go to e what does it

504
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:53,680
s can go to i i can go to e what does it
 

505
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,190
s can go to i i can go to e what does it
mean

506
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:55,200
mean
 

507
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,430
mean

537
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,509
what's catch me what what does cash try
to do here um

538
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:33,519
to do here um
 

539
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,069
to do here um
me minimization yeah memorize what does

540
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:36,079
me minimization yeah memorize what does
 

541
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:37,750
me minimization yeah memorize what does
he try to memorize

542
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:37,760
he try to memorize
 

543
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,269
he try to memorize
so it doesn't

544
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:39,279
so it doesn't
 

545
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:52,870
so it doesn't
go over again yeah

546
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:52,880

 

547
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,269

memorize okay so if you are calling the

548
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:55,279
memorize okay so if you are calling the
 

549
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,389
memorize okay so if you are calling the
s to e right and then if some somehow

550
00:11:58,389 --> 00:11:58,399
s to e right and then if some somehow
 

551
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,550
s to e right and then if some somehow
later you want to find out again we

552
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:00,560
later you want to find out again we
 

553
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,550
later you want to find out again we
don't calculate this function because we

554
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:02,560
don't calculate this function because we
 

555
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,350
don't calculate this function because we
already calculated we already calculated

556
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:05,360
already calculated we already calculated
 

557
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,710
already calculated we already calculated
and that's why we just look it up in a

558
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:08,720
and that's why we just look it up in a
 

559
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,470
and that's why we just look it up in a
notebook then we can

560
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:10,480
notebook then we can
 

561
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,069
notebook then we can
directly return the value do you get it

562
00:12:14,069 --> 00:12:14,079
directly return the value do you get it
 

563
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,430
directly return the value do you get it
do you get it

564
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:15,440
do you get it
 

565
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,030
do you get it
yeah yeah

566
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:17,040
yeah yeah
 

567
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,990
yeah yeah
okay so look if we want to replace this

568
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:20,000
okay so look if we want to replace this
 

569
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,870
okay so look if we want to replace this
cache

we do this we look we just put a
 

593
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,790
we do this we look we just put a
dictionary like memo yeah nemo

594
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:50,800
dictionary like memo yeah nemo
 

595
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,949
dictionary like memo yeah nemo
because before

596

dictionary we should return uh uh
 

601
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,629
dictionary we should return uh uh
the value will be two or four right so

602
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:00,639
the value will be two or four right so
 

603
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,389
the value will be two or four right so
it's a boolean right what's what's putin

604
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:04,399
it's a boolean right what's what's putin
 

605

and then before here before returning
 

635
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,110
and then before here before returning
all right ryan before returning true we

636
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:51,120
all right ryan before returning true we
 

637
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,030
all right ryan before returning true we
said meemo

638
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:53,040
said meemo
 

639
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,990
said meemo
this is a cuba yeah s e equals true

640
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:56,000
this is a cuba yeah s e equals true
 

641
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,470
this is a cuba yeah s e equals true
right and here what do we do here we can

642
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:58,480
right and here what do we do here we can
 

643
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,710
right and here what do we do here we can
before returning force what do we do

644
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:00,720
before returning force what do we do
 

645
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:08,629
before returning force what do we do
me

646
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:08,639

 

647
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,030

look so basically

look so basically
 

649
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,750
look so basically
before right before we returning true or

650
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:13,760
before right before we returning true or
 

651
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,509
before right before we returning true or
false yeah

652
00:14:15,509 --> 00:14:15,519
false yeah
 

653
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:16,710
false yeah
we

654
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:16,720
we
 

655
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,670
we
set the key eric look we said send a key

656
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:19,680
set the key eric look we said send a key
 

657
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,389
set the key eric look we said send a key
of prediction meanwhile right which is

658
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:22,399
of prediction meanwhile right which is
 

659
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,230
of prediction meanwhile right which is
look at what parameters are here what

660
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:24,240
look at what parameters are here what
 

661
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,590
look at what parameters are here what
parameters

662
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:25,600
parameters
 

663
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,829
parameters
s and e right so we said that as an

664
00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:27,839
s and e right so we said that as an
 

665
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,990
s and e right so we said that as an
integer to two or false so basically we

666
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,000
integer to two or false so basically we
 

667
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,310
integer to two or false so basically we
remember the values yeah correct we will

668
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:32,320
remember the values yeah correct we will
 

669
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,870
remember the values yeah correct we will
run away so you speed up if you if you

670
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:34,880
run away so you speed up if you if you
 

671
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,110
run away so you speed up if you if you
have this much more cause to the same

672
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:37,120
have this much more cause to the same
 

673
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,069
have this much more cause to the same
input s and e right got it okay let's do
