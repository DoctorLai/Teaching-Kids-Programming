right
yeah we can just follow the linked list

90
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:13,040
yeah we can just follow the linked list
 

91
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,470
yeah we can just follow the linked list
and we push this value

92
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:14,480
and we push this value
 

93
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,309
and we push this value
one two three two to the array right y

94
00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:18,319
one two three two to the array right y
 

95
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,949
one two three two to the array right y
and then we go go through this one more

96
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:20,959
and then we go go through this one more
 

97
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,309
and then we go go through this one more
time and then we just change

98
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:22,319
time and then we just change
 

99
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,190
time and then we just change
we just assign these values in the other

100
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:25,200
we just assign these values in the other
 

101
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,550
we just assign these values in the other
direction yeah

102
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:26,560
direction yeah
 

103
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,710
direction yeah
one so we're changing the value not why

104
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:28,720
one so we're changing the value not why
 

105
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,229
one so we're changing the value not why
it's the way to do it okay

106
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:30,239
it's the way to do it okay
 

107
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,390
it's the way to do it okay
do you get it yeah yeah this is one way

okay but we are now allowed
not allowed to change the value so we we

114
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:40,560
not allowed to change the value so we we
 

115
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,470
not allowed to change the value so we we
are we we

116

are we we
 

117
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,949
are we we
will do this using the other way just to

118
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:44,959
will do this using the other way just to
 

119
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:45,750
will do this using the other way just to
re-link

120
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:45,760
re-link
 

121
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,710
re-link
the directions why

122
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:50,720
the directions why
 

123
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,150
the directions why
you'll be naughty again

124
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:54,160

 

125
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,350

okay so now how can we do it define

126
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:57,360
okay so now how can we do it define
 

127
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,990
okay so now how can we do it define
yeah we're going to define okay define

128
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:00,000
yeah we're going to define okay define
 

129
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,110
yeah we're going to define okay define
so how define

130
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:01,120
so how define
 

131
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,229
so how define
linked list define reverse okay

132
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:04,239
linked list define reverse okay
 

133
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:12,070
linked list define reverse okay
reverse let's given the height

134
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:12,080

 

135
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,190

so if if

136
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:15,200
so if if
 

137
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:23,190
so if if
if head

138
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:23,200

143
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,670

so if it's just a single no or if it's

144
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:31,680
so if it's just a single no or if it's
 

145
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,750
so if it's just a single no or if it's
why why does the catapult

146
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:33,760
why why does the catapult
 

147
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,949
why why does the catapult
and banana now it is a lowercase

148
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:36,959
and banana now it is a lowercase
 

149
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,350
and banana now it is a lowercase
good good catch this is when what should

150
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:39,360
good good catch this is when what should
 

151
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,390
good good catch this is when what should
we return

152
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:40,400
we return
 

153
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,229
we return
you can if not no if it's if it's

154
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:44,239
you can if not no if it's if it's
 

155
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,630
you can if not no if it's if it's
yeah it'll extend head because good job

156
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:46,640
yeah it'll extend head because good job
 

157
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,350
yeah it'll extend head because good job
yeah

158
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:47,360
yeah
 

159
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,509
yeah
because because if it's a single note

160
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:51,519
because because if it's a single note
 

161
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,149
because because if it's a single note
a single note the reverse version is a

162
00:03:54,149 --> 00:03:54,159
a single note the reverse version is a
 

163
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,110
a single note the reverse version is a
single note right

164
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:55,120

so now we this is the base cases so
 

171
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,429
so now we this is the base cases so
what we want to do is that we reverse we

172
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:09,439
what we want to do is that we reverse we
 

173
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,630
what we want to do is that we reverse we
are now here right

174
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:10,640
are now here right
 

175
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,350
are now here right
we want to reverse this no matter how

176
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:13,360
we want to reverse this no matter how
 

177
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,030
we want to reverse this no matter how
many notes here we want to

178
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:15,040
many notes here we want to
 

179
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,150
many notes here we want to
reverse this bit yeah when we reverse

180
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:18,160
reverse this bit yeah when we reverse
 

181
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,509
reverse this bit yeah when we reverse
this bit we want to

182
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:19,519
this bit we want to
 

183
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,710
this bit we want to
change this direction to here yes that's

184
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:22,720
change this direction to here yes that's
 

185
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,430
change this direction to here yes that's
two step

186
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:23,440
two step
 

187
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,790
two step
all right yeah don't worry there could

188
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:26,800
all right yeah don't worry there could
 

189
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,110
all right yeah don't worry there could
be

190
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:27,120
be
 

191
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,390
be
a four or five a little bit more yeah

192
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:30,400
a four or five a little bit more yeah
 

193
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,390
a four or five a little bit more yeah
but what in general we want to check

194
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:32,400
but what in general we want to check
 

195
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,909
but what in general we want to check
this is head we want to

196
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:33,919
this is head we want to
 

197
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,110
this is head we want to
reverse this whole bit

198
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:37,120
reverse this whole bit
 

199
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,430
reverse this whole bit
and then once this is done we want to

200
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:39,440
and then once this is done we want to
 

201
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,950
and then once this is done we want to
change the location and

202
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:40,960
change the location and
 

203
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,030
change the location and
the link from this direction to this

204
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:43,040
the link from this direction to this
 

205
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,310
the link from this direction to this
directory

206
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:44,320
directory
 

207
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,670
directory
that's it yeah so look so

208
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:47,680
that's it yeah so look so
 

209
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,909
that's it yeah so look so
so what we can do

210
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:51,919
so what we can do
 

211
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,490
so what we can do
and equals reverse

212
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:55,500
and equals reverse
 

213
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:04,140
and equals reverse

dot next what's happening now head on
 

221
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,670
dot next what's happening now head on
next is this now right

next is this now right
 

223
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,510
next is this now right
yes yeah and then the next

224
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:17,520
yes yeah and then the next
 

225
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,870
yes yeah and then the next
needs to point it to head am i right

226
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:20,880
needs to point it to head am i right
 

227
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,070
needs to point it to head am i right
yes yes yes

00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,080
yes yes yes
 

229
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,870
yes yes yes
so look head down next is this one and

230
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:26,880
so look head down next is this one and
 

231
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,070
so look head down next is this one and
the top next is

232
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:28,080
the top next is
 

233
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,990
the top next is
pointing to this yes yes this is head

234
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:32,000
pointing to this yes yes this is head
 

235
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,230
pointing to this yes yes this is head
yeah and now what what's this pointing

236
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:34,240
yeah and now what what's this pointing
 

237
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,629
yeah and now what what's this pointing
this to pointing to none right

238
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:36,639
this to pointing to none right
 

239
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,749
this to pointing to none right
yeah so half

240
00:05:39,749 --> 00:05:39,759
yeah so half
 

241
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,390
yeah so half
dot next equals nine

242
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:44,400
dot next equals nine
 

243
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,749
dot next equals nine
and then one return

00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:49,759

 

245
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,060

why what should we return

246
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:54,070

the new head the new head is somewhere

the new head the new head is somewhere

the new head the new head is somewhere

here right
 

253
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,309
here right
it's this bit yeah yeah the new head is

254
00:06:12,309 --> 00:06:12,319
it's this bit yeah yeah the new head is
 

255
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,830
it's this bit yeah yeah the new head is
somewhere here which is called the

259
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,909

so this is the way to reverse it got it

260
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:19,919
so this is the way to reverse it got it
 

261
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:20,870
so this is the way to reverse it got it
yes

262
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:20,880
yes
 

263
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,430
yes
do it okay let me let me explain it one

264
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:23,440
do it okay let me let me explain it one
 

265
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,230
do it okay let me let me explain it one
more time

266
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:24,240
more time
 

267
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,550
more time
reverse if it's a single note we just

268
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:26,560
reverse if it's a single note we just
 

269
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,510
reverse if it's a single note we just
return it

270
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:27,520
return it
 

271
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,670
return it
because the single note reverse it is a

272
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:29,680
because the single note reverse it is a
 

273
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,430
because the single note reverse it is a
single note right

274
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:31,440
single note right
 

275
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,150
single note right
then we reverse this is the head we

276
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:34,160
then we reverse this is the head we
 

277
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,430
then we reverse this is the head we
reverse

278
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:35,440
reverse
 

279
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,749
reverse
the this this large bit no matter how

280
00:06:37,749 --> 00:06:37,759
the this this large bit no matter how
 

281
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:38,629
the this this large bit no matter how
big is that

282
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:38,639
big is that
 

283
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,230
big is that
right then head down next is this

284
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:42,240
right then head down next is this
 

285
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,790
right then head down next is this
now and we need to change the link from

286
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:44,800
now and we need to change the link from
 

287
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,550
now and we need to change the link from
this direction to this direction so we

288
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:46,560
this direction to this direction so we
 

289
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,070
this direction to this direction so we
point it to head

290
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,080
point it to head
 

291
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,230
point it to head
and then head down next previously is

292
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:50,240
and then head down next previously is
 

293
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,629
and then head down next previously is
pointing to here but we need to erase it

294
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:52,639
pointing to here but we need to erase it
 

295
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,110
pointing to here but we need to erase it
to point into noun right yeah and then

296
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,120
to point into noun right yeah and then
 

297
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,270
to point into noun right yeah and then
we return the new head which is not his

298
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:57,280
we return the new head which is not his
 

299
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:57,990
we return the new head which is not his

but we don't know which is given
 

307
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:04,870
but we don't know which is given
returning

308
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:04,880
returning
 

309
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,469
returning
n right got it complexity

310
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:08,479
n right got it complexity
 

311
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,189
n right got it complexity
okay yeah what n is the number of the

312
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:11,199
okay yeah what n is the number of the
 

313
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,870
okay yeah what n is the number of the
notes in the linked list because we have

314
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:12,880
notes in the linked list because we have
 

315
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,150
notes in the linked list because we have
to visit each

316
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:14,160
to visit each
 

317
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,749
to visit each
node can change it and change change the

318
00:07:17,749 --> 00:07:17,759
node can change it and change change the
 

319
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,710
node can change it and change change the
direction yeah

320
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:18,720
direction yeah
 

321
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,629
direction yeah
good job how how can we do it

322
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:22,639
good job how how can we do it
 

323
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,550
good job how how can we do it
without the recursion

324
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:26,560

 

325
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,150

we can do it using uh another approach

326
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:30,160
we can do it using uh another approach
 

327
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,230
we can do it using uh another approach
if you you don't keep the middle

328
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:34,240
if you you don't keep the middle
 

329
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,189
if you you don't keep the middle
now we we we have we can do this have a

330
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:37,199
now we we we have we can do this have a
 

331
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,150
now we we we have we can do this have a

colon node
 

337
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,950

and every time every time

338
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:44,960
and every time every time
 

339
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,189
and every time every time

previous previous lesson
 

567
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,030
previous previous lesson
yeah a cycle yeah we we one in one

568
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:21,040
yeah a cycle yeah we we one in one
 

569
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,230
yeah a cycle yeah we we one in one
lesson we're checking like

570
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:22,240
lesson we're checking like
 

571
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,470
lesson we're checking like
if there's a cycle right we know what

572
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:24,480
if there's a cycle right we know what
 

573
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,910
if there's a cycle right we know what
the cycle is

574
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:25,920
the cycle is
 

575
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,910
the cycle is
now look at this head thing we are

576
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:27,920
now look at this head thing we are
 

577
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,350
now look at this head thing we are
creating a

578
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:29,360
creating a
 

579
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,990
creating a
link list with no from 1 to 10 to 9 okay

580
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:34,000
link list with no from 1 to 10 to 9 okay
 

581
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,189
link list with no from 1 to 10 to 9 okay
okay now we want to reverse it so if now

582
00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:37,199
okay now we want to reverse it so if now
 

583
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,150
okay now we want to reverse it so if now
even if now i print it let's say if i

584
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:40,160
even if now i print it let's say if i
 

585
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,470
even if now i print it let's say if i
print it

586
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:42,480
print it
 

587
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,430
print it
if i print it now let's say look if p

588
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:45,440
if i print it now let's say look if p
 

589
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,150
if i print it now let's say look if p
equals hat

590
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:46,160
equals hat
 

591
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,230
equals hat
and then for uh y p

592
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:50,240
and then for uh y p
 

593
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,509
and then for uh y p
print p the value

594
00:14:53,509 --> 00:14:53,519
print p the value
 

595
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,629
print p the value
p equals p next no so what's the answer

596
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:56,639
p equals p next no so what's the answer
 

597
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:57,269
p equals p next no so what's the answer
now

598
00:14:57,269 --> 00:14:57,279
now
 

599
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:02,949
now
if i put this what's the answer

600
00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:02,959

 

601
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,230

what's the expected output from one to

602
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:06,240
what's the expected output from one to
 

603
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,670
what's the expected output from one to
nine right

604
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:07,680
nine right
 

605
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,189
nine right
put it 20 different one tonight because

606
00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:09,199
put it 20 different one tonight because
 

607
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,030
put it 20 different one tonight because
the length is from one two three four

608
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:11,040
the length is from one two three four
 

609
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,590
the length is from one two three four
nine now we want to reverse it yeah

610
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:13,600
nine now we want to reverse it yeah
 

611
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,949
nine now we want to reverse it yeah
when it turns into one look this is

612
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:16,959
when it turns into one look this is
 

613
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:22,710
when it turns into one look this is
this is uh let's say

614
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:22,720

 

615
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:30,960

before reverse the linked list

616
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:30,970

actually
uh reverse so let's let's do this uh

628
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:47,920
uh reverse so let's let's do this uh
 

629
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,829
uh reverse so let's let's do this uh
six that's the one p equals the

630
00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:52,839
six that's the one p equals the
 

631
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:55,350

reverse reverse link
 

633
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,150
reverse reverse link
yeah reverse the head the head is not

634
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:58,160
yeah reverse the head the head is not
 

635
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,150
yeah reverse the head the head is not
changing and then now we need to

636
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:00,160
changing and then now we need to
 

637
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,350
changing and then now we need to
uh now and now we need to print it

638
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:03,360
uh now and now we need to print it
 

639
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,069
uh now and now we need to print it
print it so that let's actually define a

640
00:16:06,069 --> 00:16:06,079
print it so that let's actually define a
 

641
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:07,990
print it so that let's actually define a
function to print print the linked list

642
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:08,000
function to print print the linked list
 

643
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,710
function to print print the linked list
okay

644
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:08,720
okay
 

645
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,629
okay
so define print print linked list

646
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:12,639
so define print print linked list
 

647
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,069
so define print print linked list
head okay so now

648
00:16:16,069 --> 00:16:16,079
head okay so now
 

649
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,189
head okay so now
p equals hat y p

650
00:16:19,189 --> 00:16:19,199
p equals hat y p
 

651
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,030
p equals hat y p
is not num okay o y p we can do this

652
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:23,040
is not num okay o y p we can do this
 

653
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,230
is not num okay o y p we can do this
y between p value

654
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:26,240
y between p value
 

655
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,590
y between p value
p equals p dot next no right

656
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:29,600
p equals p dot next no right
 

657
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,430
p equals p dot next no right
next now that's it and then

658
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:33,440
next now that's it and then
 

659
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:41,030
next now that's it and then
and we can replace this

660
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:41,040

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,069
so you still remember if head is
now all had done next is long next no

680
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:20,079
now all had done next is long next no
 

681
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,510
now all had done next is long next no
it's long right

682
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:21,520
it's long right
 

683
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,949
it's long right
yeah return what

684
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:24,959
yeah return what
 

685
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,370
yeah return what
retirement

686
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:27,380
retirement
 

687

head weather now we need to reverse the

690
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:32,640
head weather now we need to reverse the
 

691
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:41,430
head weather now we need to reverse the
its next next period

692
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:41,440

 

693
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,310

next next now yeah and then

694
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:46,320
next next now yeah and then
 

695
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,350
next next now yeah and then
head to next now next now

696
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:49,360
head to next now next now
 

697
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,590
head to next now next now
equals one head head we're done

698
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:53,600
equals one head head we're done
 

699
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,630
equals one head head we're done
and heads on next note equals one head

700
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:56,640
and heads on next note equals one head
 

701
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:04,070
and heads on next note equals one head
no no because we we need to remove it

702
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:04,080

 

703
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,190

okay so now look if we reverse it uh now

704
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:07,200
okay so now look if we reverse it uh now
 

705
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,950
okay so now look if we reverse it uh now
we reverse it so it should bring

706
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:08,960
we reverse it so it should bring
 

707
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,430
we reverse it so it should bring
quinoa what's the answer

708
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:13,440

 

709
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,630

what's the answer here

710
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:16,640

 

711
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,150

uh nine eight seven six five four yeah

712
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:20,160
uh nine eight seven six five four yeah
 

713
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,630
uh nine eight seven six five four yeah
we're done

714
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:20,640
we're done
 

715
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,310
we're done
look yes yes you see yeah before reverse

716
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:24,320
look yes yes you see yeah before reverse
 

717
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,990
look yes yes you see yeah before reverse
the link is one two three four five nine

718
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:26,000
the link is one two three four five nine
 

719
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,630
the link is one two three four five nine
seven nine

720
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:26,640
seven nine
 

721
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,190
seven nine
after

722
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:31,200

 

723
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,350

let's try the other the other approach

724
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:33,360
let's try the other the other approach
 

725
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,230
let's try the other the other approach
that this

726
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:34,240
that this
 

727
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,470
that this
is one approach reverse yeah let's do a

728
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:36,480
is one approach reverse yeah let's do a
 

729
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,390
is one approach reverse yeah let's do a
second version

730
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:38,400
second version
 

731
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:45,750
second version
second version can you sit down please

732
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:45,760

 

733
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,630

remember what we talked about previous

734
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:48,640
remember what we talked about previous
 

735
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,830
remember what we talked about previous
equals

736
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:49,840
equals
 

737
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,029
equals
noun current equals

738
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:53,039
noun current equals
 

739
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,230
noun current equals
path y current right

740
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:56,240
path y current right
 

741
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,230
path y current right
white color is the same as white color

742
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:58,240
white color is the same as white color
 

743
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,510
white color is the same as white color
is not known

744
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:01,520

 

745
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,470

we need to save that next next uh

746
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:04,480
we need to save that next next uh
 

747
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:04,950
we need to save that next next uh
current

748
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:04,960
current
 

749
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,549
current
next now right and then current dot

750
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:08,559
next now right and then current dot
 

751
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:12,630
next now right and then current dot
next now will be previous no

752
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:12,640
next now will be previous no
 

753
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,630
next now will be previous no
previous now will be current now and

754
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:14,640
previous now will be current now and
 

755
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,549
previous now will be current now and
karen now will be next year

756
00:19:16,549 --> 00:19:16,559
karen now will be next year
 

757
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,750
karen now will be next year
and return previous okay

758
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:19,760
and return previous okay
 

759
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,270
and return previous okay
let's let's try let's try reverse two

760
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:23,280
let's let's try let's try reverse two
 

761
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,549
let's let's try let's try reverse two
right okay

762
00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:24,559
right okay
 

763
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:27,669
right okay
give us two

764
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:27,679

 

765
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,590

yeah it's the same yeah you see it's the

766
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:29,600
yeah it's the same yeah you see it's the
 

767
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,110
yeah it's the same yeah you see it's the
same yeah

768
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:31,120
same yeah
 

769
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,510
same yeah
yeah got it and how about the one we

770
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:33,520
yeah got it and how about the one we
 

771
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,310
yeah got it and how about the one we
talked about in

772
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:34,320
talked about in
 

773
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,830
talked about in
uh at the beginning which is which is

774
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:36,840
uh at the beginning which is which is
 

775
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,990
uh at the beginning which is which is
not uh

776
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:38,000
not uh
 

777
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,110
not uh
reverse function three do you get it

778
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:41,120
reverse function three do you get it
 

779
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,470
reverse function three do you get it
how about let's do it reverse

780
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:42,480
how about let's do it reverse
 

781
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,669
how about let's do it reverse
consistency just by copying the

782
00:19:45,669 --> 00:19:45,679
consistency just by copying the
 

783
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,940
consistency just by copying the
values

784
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:48,950

 

785
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:51,270

[Applause]

786
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:51,280
[Applause]
 

787
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,630
[Applause]
which is reverse three

788
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:54,640
which is reverse three
 

789
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,510
which is reverse three
so we we need to save it in the data

790
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:57,520
so we we need to save it in the data
 

791
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,470
so we we need to save it in the data
yeah data is

792
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:58,480
yeah data is
 

793
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:04,830
yeah data is
an array yeah data is a

794
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:04,840

 

795
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:12,149

data

796
00:20:12,149 --> 00:20:12,159

 

797
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,270

we put it into this value and then p

798
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:15,280
we put it into this value and then p
 

799
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,149
we put it into this value and then p
equals p dot next now right now the

800
00:20:18,149 --> 00:20:18,159
equals p dot next now right now the
 

801
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:19,270
equals p dot next now right now the
theta

802
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:19,280
theta
 

803
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,070
theta
we got the data yeah theta which is one

804
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:22,080
we got the data yeah theta which is one
 

805
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,070
we got the data yeah theta which is one
two three four to nine right

806
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:24,080
two three four to nine right
 

807
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,390
two three four to nine right
and then now we need to go back to the

808
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:26,400
and then now we need to go back to the
 

809
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,750
and then now we need to go back to the
head

810
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:27,760
head
 

811
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,190
head
and then why p

812
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:31,200
and then why p
 

813
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,909
and then why p
what that is

814
00:20:35,909 --> 00:20:35,919

 

815
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,070

what do we do now we need to assign the

816
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:38,080
what do we do now we need to assign the
 

817
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,990
what do we do now we need to assign the
value t value equals

818
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:40,000
value t value equals
 

819
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,669
value t value equals
equals theta dot

820
00:20:43,669 --> 00:20:43,679
equals theta dot
 

821
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,110
equals theta dot
top remember yeah and then t

822
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:47,120
top remember yeah and then t
 

823
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,830
top remember yeah and then t
equals p dot next now and we turn

824
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:51,840
equals p dot next now and we turn
 

825
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,990
equals p dot next now and we turn
head yeah because we're not changing the

826
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:54,000
head yeah because we're not changing the
 

827
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,669
head yeah because we're not changing the
we are not changing the no we are we are

828
00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:55,679
we are not changing the no we are we are
 

829
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,590
we are not changing the no we are we are
just changing the value right

830
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:57,600
just changing the value right
 

831
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,149
just changing the value right
yes yes

832
00:21:02,149 --> 00:21:02,159
yes yes
 

833
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,630
yes yes
let's do this if it is working yes

834
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:04,640
let's do this if it is working yes
 

835
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,149
let's do this if it is working yes
exactly it's the working

836
00:21:06,149 --> 00:21:06,159
exactly it's the working
 

837
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,990
exactly it's the working
but for the last version it's just

838
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:08,000
but for the last version it's just
 

839
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,669
but for the last version it's just
changing the value of no it doesn't

840
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:09,679
changing the value of no it doesn't
 

841
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,830
changing the value of no it doesn't
change the direction do you get it

842
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:11,840
change the direction do you get it
 

843
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,310
change the direction do you get it
yes do you understand eric

844
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:16,320
yes do you understand eric
 

845
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,029
yes do you understand eric
yes let's see the code one more time so

846
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:19,039
yes let's see the code one more time so
 

847
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,190
yes let's see the code one more time so
we have a three version yeah

848
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:21,200
we have a three version yeah
 

849
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,029
we have a three version yeah
this is twin reverse it this is the

850
00:21:25,029 --> 00:21:25,039
this is twin reverse it this is the
 

851
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,430
this is twin reverse it this is the
uh recursion the cursion version yeah

852
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:27,440
uh recursion the cursion version yeah
 

853
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,350
uh recursion the cursion version yeah
recursive version

854
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:29,360
recursive version
 

855
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,830
recursive version
and reverse 2 is the iterative version

856
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:33,840
and reverse 2 is the iterative version
 

857
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,470
and reverse 2 is the iterative version
