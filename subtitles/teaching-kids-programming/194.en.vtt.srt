00:00:07,269 --> 00:00:07,279
okay remember what is substring oh it
 

5
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:08,710
okay remember what is substring oh it
just like you know

6
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:08,720
just like you know
 

7
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,990
just like you know
a bit yeah you know what so

a bit yeah you know what so
 

9
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,110
a bit yeah you know what so
let's say a b c d e f what's the

10
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:15,120
let's say a b c d e f what's the
 

11
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,230
let's say a b c d e f what's the
substring

12
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:16,240
substring
 

13
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,269
substring
a a b a b c or b

14
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:19,279
a a b a b c or b
 

15
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,550
a a b a b c or b
c d yes to be continuous right abc

16
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:22,560
c d yes to be continuous right abc
 

17
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,589
c d yes to be continuous right abc
how many sub strings of size three how

18
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:25,599
how many sub strings of size three how
 

19
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:26,630
how many sub strings of size three how
many

20
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:26,640
many
 

21
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,230
many
how many of these size three one two

22
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:30,240
how many of these size three one two
 

23
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,350
how many of these size three one two
three four okay so a b c b c d

24
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:33,360
three four okay so a b c b c d
 

25
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,110
three four okay so a b c b c d
c d e d f okay let's try that's fine

26
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:37,120
c d e d f okay let's try that's fine
 

27
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,990
c d e d f okay let's try that's fine
yeah yeah yeah size three uh substring

28
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:40,000
yeah yeah yeah size three uh substring
 

29
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,990
yeah yeah yeah size three uh substring
of size three okay and

30
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:42,000
of size three okay and
 

31
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,150
of size three okay and
if i give you a string and i want you to

32
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:44,160
if i give you a string and i want you to
 

33
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,069
if i give you a string and i want you to
count how many sub strings

34
00:00:46,069 --> 00:00:46,079
count how many sub strings
 

35
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,430
count how many sub strings
of size 3 and each substring contains

36
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:49,440
of size 3 and each substring contains
 

37
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,750
of size 3 and each substring contains
only unique characters so these are

38
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:51,760
only unique characters so these are
 

39
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,350
only unique characters so these are
unique characters but aab

40
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:53,360
unique characters but aab
 

41
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,189
unique characters but aab
is not unique characters okay for

42
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:55,199
is not unique characters okay for
 

43
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,470
is not unique characters okay for
example a b c

44
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:56,480
example a b c
 

45
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,670
example a b c
d e you need to tell me is what

46
00:00:59,670 --> 00:00:59,680
d e you need to tell me is what
 

47
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,510
d e you need to tell me is what
this is does not have has like a

48
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:01,520
this is does not have has like a
 

49
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,189
this is does not have has like a
duplicate calculator so this is

50
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:03,199
duplicate calculator so this is
 

51
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,030
duplicate calculator so this is
on top abc comes bcd comes city council

52
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:07,040
on top abc comes bcd comes city council
 

53
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:07,510
on top abc comes bcd comes city council
three

54
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:07,520
three
 

55
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,030
three
okay got it yeah

56
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:11,040
okay got it yeah
 

57
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,710
okay got it yeah
yeah i'll argue with this problem okay

58
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:14,720
yeah i'll argue with this problem okay
 

59
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,950
yeah i'll argue with this problem okay
so any idea how we're doing is giving a

60
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:16,960
so any idea how we're doing is giving a
 

61
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,830
so any idea how we're doing is giving a
string

62
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:17,840
string
 

63
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,030
string
given a string of size n

64
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:21,040
given a string of size n
 

65
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:27,620
given a string of size n
so how how do we know

66
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:27,630

 

67
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:38,830

[Music]

68
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:38,840

 

69
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,749

like so first of all i think it's good

70
00:01:41,749 --> 00:01:41,759
like so first of all i think it's good
 

71
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:42,630
like so first of all i think it's good
like the set

72
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:42,640
like the set
 

73
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,109
like the set
content is unique yeah yeah yeah okay a

74
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:45,119
content is unique yeah yeah yeah okay a
 

75
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,230
content is unique yeah yeah yeah okay a
good point set

76
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:46,240
good point set
 

77
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,510
good point set
so first of all if a string has has

78
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:49,520
so first of all if a string has has
 

79
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,429
so first of all if a string has has
n characters a b c d how many

80
00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:53,439
n characters a b c d how many
 

81
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,149
n characters a b c d how many
how many sides a substrate of size three

82
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:56,159
how many sides a substrate of size three
 

83
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,190
how many sides a substrate of size three
how many times how many

84
00:01:59,190 --> 00:01:59,200
how many times how many
 

85
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,350
how many times how many
uh t okay so what what is this

86
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:03,360
uh t okay so what what is this
 

87
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,149
uh t okay so what what is this
a b c b okay then if it's the end

88
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:06,159
a b c b okay then if it's the end
 

89
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:06,950
a b c b okay then if it's the end
character if

90
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:06,960
character if
 

91
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,109
character if
n equals four then you say they are two

92
00:02:09,109 --> 00:02:09,119
n equals four then you say they are two
 

93
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,910
n equals four then you say they are two
and n equals five

94
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:11,920
and n equals five
 

95
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,030
and n equals five
how many one two three

96
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,040
how many one two three
 

97
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,150
how many one two three
three yeah so what's the n equals six

98
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:18,160
three yeah so what's the n equals six
 

99
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,390
three yeah so what's the n equals six
equals one

100
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:22,400
equals one
 

101
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,030
equals one
i mean n equals six how many sub strings

102
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:25,040
i mean n equals six how many sub strings
 

103
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,869
i mean n equals six how many sub strings
of size three

104
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:26,879
of size three
 

105
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,510
of size three
let's see come on two three and what's

106
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:29,520
let's see come on two three and what's
 

107
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,990
let's see come on two three and what's
next

108
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:32,000

 

109
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,150

four yeah so so if you subtract two yeah

110
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:36,160
four yeah so so if you subtract two yeah
 

111
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,470
four yeah so so if you subtract two yeah
so

112
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:36,480
so
 

113
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,830
so
n minus two okay so they are n minus two

114
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:39,840
n minus two okay so they are n minus two
 

115
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,309
n minus two okay so they are n minus two
substrings of size three and we just

116
00:02:42,309 --> 00:02:42,319
substrings of size three and we just
 

117
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,110
substrings of size three and we just
need to check

118
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:43,120
need to check
 

119
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,150
need to check
proof of this n minus two

120
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:46,160
proof of this n minus two
 

121
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,030
proof of this n minus two
right and how do we check if there are

122
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:49,040
right and how do we check if there are
 

123
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,070
right and how do we check if there are
if the size

124
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:50,080
if the size
 

125
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,309
if the size
substrings or size 3 contains only

126
00:02:52,309 --> 00:02:52,319
substrings or size 3 contains only
 

127
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,110
substrings or size 3 contains only
duplicate

128
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:53,120
duplicate
 

129
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,030
duplicate
unique characters if this string is abc

130
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,040
unique characters if this string is abc
 

131
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,309
unique characters if this string is abc
how do we know is it's

132
00:02:58,309 --> 00:02:58,319
how do we know is it's
 

133
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,670
how do we know is it's
unique in the size if it's the same

134
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:01,680
unique in the size if it's the same
 

135
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,309
unique in the size if it's the same
so if this is equal to this if release

136
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:04,319
so if this is equal to this if release
 

137
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,149
so if this is equal to this if release
is not equal to that and this is not

138
00:03:06,149 --> 00:03:06,159
is not equal to that and this is not
 

139
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,589
is not equal to that and this is not
equal to that and this is

140
00:03:07,589 --> 00:03:07,599
equal to that and this is
 

141
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:12,149
equal to that and this is
no input right okay good

142
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:12,159
no input right okay good
 

143
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:17,190
no input right okay good
what's the time complexity

144
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:17,200

 

145
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,470

define let's say check

146
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:20,480
define let's say check
 

147
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,750
define let's say check
string column okay

148
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:23,760
string column okay
 

149
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,309
string column okay
like even if the length is less than

150
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:26,319
like even if the length is less than
 

151
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,229
like even if the length is less than
three now what do we do

152
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:28,239
three now what do we do
 

153
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,509
three now what do we do
we just return zero right yeah you can

154
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:31,519
we just return zero right yeah you can
 

155
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,670
we just return zero right yeah you can
optionally please if len s

156
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:33,680
optionally please if len s
 

157
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,350
optionally please if len s
smaller than three what does it mean we

158
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:35,360
smaller than three what does it mean we
 

159
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,509
smaller than three what does it mean we
can't find any substring of size three

160
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:37,519
can't find any substring of size three
 

161
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:38,470
can't find any substring of size three
right

162
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:38,480
right
 

163
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,789
right
yeah if a b you can't find any

164
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:40,799
yeah if a b you can't find any
 

165
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:41,589
yeah if a b you can't find any
substrings

166
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:41,599
substrings
 

167
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,710
substrings
