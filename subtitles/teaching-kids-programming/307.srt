2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,160
so

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,320
suppose that you have enough money and

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,320
then there's a price for the each you

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,680
know the chocolate for example you want

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,279
to buy a chocolate yeah you want to buy

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,960
a chocolate you want to buy and sell

8
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,640
chocolate so let's say

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,640
one two this is the price of the

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,840
chocolate on the day yeah

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,220
and six

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,039
eight nine okay

13
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:30,960
[Music]

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,480
so let's say you have enough money but

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,559
the the thing is that you can only sell

16
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,640
it before you can only sell it after you

17
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,719
buy it okay you cannot

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,559
you cannot do the opposite so you want

19
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,559
to buy the first and i said right you

20
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,320
can save it after you buy it

21
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,920
so the profit you know the profit for

22
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,160
example today i

23
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,120
i buy like one chocolate using one

24
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,600
dollar

25
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,600
and tomorrow i sell this chocolate

26
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,480
for five dollars how much money i can

27
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,480
make the profit

28
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,600
so today i buy one chocolate using one

29
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,560
corn or what one

30
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,960
dollar

31
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,880
one pound for example like tomorrow i

32
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,400
sell this chocolate

33
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,759
for five pounds four thousand okay four

34
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,759
pounds okay so

35
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,720
in this case

36
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,960
okay

37
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,840
so this is the prices for the coin for

38
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,840
the chocolate

39
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,960
this is the chocolate price and then you

40
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:32,079
can buy and sell once so what's the

41
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:35,840
maximum profit you can get one

42
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,840
ten one ten well done yeah

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,159
can you get more maybe if i put a 19

44
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:44,640
here what was there 119. wow okay how

45
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:48,079
about seven here

46
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,600
uh 219. wow so what's your approach yes

47
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,079
exactly what's your approach you can you

48
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,439
can just see it directly right ryan yeah

49
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,680
you can see it directly what was your

50
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:58,240
approach

51
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,040
you can prove things so fast

52
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,320
yeah

53
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,000
how how do you preface how do you

54
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,240
improve

55
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,320
how do you do first just minusing the

56
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,320
number note oh wait this is

57
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,560
may work but there's an exception that

58
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,040
look if i leave this 19 i put here

59
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,080
i put it 19 here and i put it

60
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,400
for example 10. so you go look

61
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,160
this is the lowest smallest but this is

62
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,040
the biggest but the biggest comes before

63
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,680
the smaller you come right so what this

64
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,239
is

65
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,480
you can go and then okay so you find the

66
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,519
smallest number yeah okay

67
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,040
and then

68
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,560
you look for

69
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,959
you know almost quite close the biggest

70
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,640
number after this number

71
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,319
yeah yeah yeah so we want to find the

72
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,959
biggest number after tomorrow so i'll

73
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,959
keep checking her

74
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,120
good point good question yeah okay so we

75
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,440
come to this we come to some list later

76
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,879
okay but as you mentioned we can solve

77
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,599
this using proof of thing how can we

78
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:15,879
prove first how can we prefer

79
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,879
everything of proverbs

80
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:36,080
still not good still no good okay so can

81
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,239
answer me what what's the approach to

82
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,840
proof of what are we trying to prove uh

83
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:43,280
checking every possibility of what

84
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,360
last point

85
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,640
but how we how we trying to calculate

86
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,480
the profit i mean

87
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,200
we are trying to

88
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,799
prove our thing that what

89
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,400
what are we trying to prove for thing

90
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:59,200
here try the what we're trying to bring

91
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,959
try the what on which day we're going to

92
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,799
buy and which day we're going to sell

93
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,519
right this is the thing we could try

94
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,400
okay so if we try to buy this on this

95
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,120
day

96
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,120
then we can try the sale on those day if

97
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,879
you try to buy it on this day we can try

98
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:17,120
in the days yes we say right ryan

99
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:21,440
yeah yeah okay

100
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:25,120
so let's do this defy makes profit

101
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,120
no singing please too noisy

102
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,040
okay the answer will be at the beginning

103
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:34,320
zero and n will be the days of the

104
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,320
numbers yeah the numbers

105
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,440
prices

106
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,639
so now for

107
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:46,400
what

108
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:48,800
let's say bye bye yeah p in range

109
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,110
gradual

110
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,840
strange

[Music]

112
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:58,080
what we can buy on any day right

113
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:59,040
yeah yes and okay then for sale for us

114
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,039
in

115
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,560
range what

116
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:07,039
for each pie day we can sell on what day

117
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:11,039
we can tell on

118
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,039
on what day if we find sir

119
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,149
[Music]

120
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,600
so answer equals we want to keep the

121
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,280
maximum

122
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,120
perfect answer

123
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,840
okay so how can we write this what's the

124
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:37,039
profit if we buy on what's the profit if

125
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:38,880
we buy on day b and sell on day s

126
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,840
what's the problem if you buy on day b

127
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,840
and say on day s

128
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,639
prize

129
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,800
price

130
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,479
s nun

131
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,479
and what plus or minus

[Music]

133
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,080

[Music]

135
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:19,639
come on you see a four why are you still

136
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,639
saying okay

137
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,800
rn square what's a space complexity i

138
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,800
want one

139
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,639
can you tell me what's a one when i ask

140
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,479
for a time complexity why you always say

141
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,840
one what's the one

142
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,720
sorry

143
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,639
one you like one okay oh n square why is

144
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,840
that because this is going to end and

145
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,840
for you i have n have n possibilities

146
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,240
and for each choice

147
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,680
you have another n possibilities yeah

148
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,199
you got it

149
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,680
yeah so that's always square right

150
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,319
the space complexity one is constant

151
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,720
because we are using only constant

152
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:59,280
space the answer two variables yeah

153
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:03,520
answer n b s

154
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,400
okay yes okay can we do better

155
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,599
yes

156
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,919
oh

00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,919
um

158
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,639
how can we do better

159
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:16,800
uh let's uh let's buy this okay

in can you see layout

167
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:47,039
in a graph okay this is the day

168
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,560
and this is the price okay let's say the

169
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,440
first day

00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,800
ten probably here yeah

175
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,599
six probably here yeah

176
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:05,039
a probably here 10 over here okay

177
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:07,440
so if you if you put it

178
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,440
yeah

179
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:16,479
okay yeah you further so what are we

180
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:19,520
looking for we want to look for uh

181
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:21,759
we want to look for the lowest peak

182
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,160
flow is this is called the noise yeah

183
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:27,840
and the largest the top

184
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:30,720
so that we want to look for the largest

185
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:33,279
after the lowest right the way it fits

186
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:36,000
the lowest is at the end

187
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:38,399
it doesn't matter still if it's the end

188
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,360
look if it's the end

189
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,760
yeah i'm just doing this if it is n okay

190
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,839
it doesn't matter i'm just going to scan

191
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,360
it from the left to the right

192
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,760
okay

193
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,600
so the point is that we keep tracking of

194
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,720
the minimum

195
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,880
minimum we have seen so far yeah but and

196
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,399
now we when we have a maximum we can

197
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,800
subtract it

198
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,560
no no not a maximum we have a bigger

199
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,080
number then we can subtract that minimum

200
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,399
we have seen so far

201
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,640
so look look at this example

202
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,160
three okay let's say we have the minimum

203
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,760
value yeah

204
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,240
i know we have answer okay and then you

205
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:17,839
tell me if it's all right okay

206
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,839
what's the minimum so far three

207
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:23,600
okay and

208
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:25,680
okay then what's the minimum so far two

209
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,120
so we get it

210
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,720
uh so

211
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,440
so so we need to

212
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,279
as well update the answer right yeah so

213
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,920
what's the minimum so far three and the

214
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,920
answer will be the current number minus

215
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,440
three is zero okay because

216
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,110
yeah i don't know i know what's the

217
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,160
minimum number white okay

218
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:45,440
[Music]

219
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,600
two yeah

220
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,440
two yes there are two

221
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,760
and it's still zero right because the

222
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,920
maximum is the the current number is two

223
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,720
two minus minimum is yeah what's the

224
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:59,360
minimum silver

225
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,880
two i know what's the current number 10

226
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:05,200
10 minus two eight

227
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,200
this one max answer we want to find the

228
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,040
maximum and this minimum we're on the

229
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,519
random minimum okay next one what's the

230
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,839
minimum number so far

231
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:17,519
what's the what's the profit if we use

232
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:20,399
the current these numbers minus the mean

233
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,800
so is it bigger than a yeah

234
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,120
and this what's the minimum

235
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,160
still so far too right

236
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,640
and

237
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:31,440
six six

238
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:34,320
we're not updating yeah about

239
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,720
we're not updating this 10 minus 2 8 is

240
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,800
the same so what's the profit

241
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,160
is that a yeah

242
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,079
okay got it

243
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,800
so the thing is that we keep tracking of

244
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,720
the minimum value we have seen so far

245
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,399
and then we use the current value to

246
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,800
subtract that because we know in the

247
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:53,760
past we have seen this minimum value and

248
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,760
then if we set it on the day on current

249
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,920
day we can make a profit of a current

250
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,040
number minus that mean number all right

251
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,560
yeah so

252
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,040
in this is one goal what's the time come

253
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,040
back stick

254
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,399
oh and we're down here to jump

255
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,399
so let's try this

256
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,240
define

257
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,240
max profit

258
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,920
prices

259
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,880
prices

260
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,640
so that's n equals length

261
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:26,720
uh actually we don't need to define the

262
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:31,040
n okay let's say answer equals zero

263
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:32,640
the minimum value minimum value equals

264
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,399
equal as well at the beginning the

265
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,079
minimum value will be the

266
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,959
what's the biggest number you can think

267
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,000
of

268
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,440
um

269
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,560
infinity

270
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,560
infinity

271
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,079
and now we go through here

272
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,360
for i

273
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,920
in

274
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,079
prices which also use prices now we want

275
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,480
to find the update the minimum value

276
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:55,360
yeah so how can we update this mean

277
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,920
value equal as well

278
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,959
all right mean

279
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,240
and mean value of nn

280
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,560
i right

281
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,320
right now we're updating the minimum

282
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,160
value and then now what's the profit if

283
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:12,800
we sell it on the

284
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:16,480
on on this day what's the profit

285
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:18,399
answer equals max

286
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:22,000
answer and then what

287
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:25,399
i now i value minus one

288
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,399
minus one

289
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:30,359
[Music]

290
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:42,240
v min v is the minimum value we have

291
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,600
seen so far yeah

292
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,120
i'm i is the value is the price of today

293
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,360
all right no

294
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,399
i is the price of today and we need to

295
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,959
manage

296
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:55,519
the price the minimum price we've seen

297
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,399
right mainly yeah i mean that's what i

298
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,800
said

299
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,000
okay good job i only returned

300
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:04,440
also

301
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,440
what's the tongue honestly um

302
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:10,799
[Music]

303
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,680
okay so this is this is the we

304
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,079
like you know we keep checking on the

305
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:29,600
minimum number and we updating the

306
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:32,160
profit max profit okay okay so remember

307
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,720
we talked about the captain right

308
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,959
yeah

309
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,760
what does it mean

310
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:43,040
is a algorithm for dynamic programming

311
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:45,519
it's already dynamic programming

312
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:48,399
what what does it try to do

313
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:50,560
uh i forgot you forgot we want to keep

314
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,720
the next step away song right

315
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,680
yeah remember

316
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:58,320
yeah let's do a little bit review okay

317
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,120
so for example like 3 2

318
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,120
1

319
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,839
0 10

320
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,360
10

321
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,240
to 5

322
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,079
what's the what's the maximum sum of the

323
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,160
sub array

324
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:14,120
sub rate continuous yeah what's the sub

325
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,120
maximum sum sub array

326
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:18,639
[Music]

327
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,650
which one what's the sum what's the

328
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:24,809
maximum sum of the summary

329
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:24,809
[Music]

330
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,839
come on

331
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:29,920
[Music]

332
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,000
five to five this is seven this is six

333
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:34,320
yeah you can't use this because they

334
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,680
you'll make the sum less

335
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,760
right one yeah okay

336
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,000
brand

337
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:45,519
okay so look so how can we do this we

338
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,000
use the dp array dpi we talk about the

339
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:50,399
subarray the maximum sub rate sum the

340
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,800
ends the index i and what is the equal

341
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:55,920
equals max this is the katan yeah it's

342
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,600
actually dynamic programming dpi minus

343
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,720
one yeah

344
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,320
yeah

345
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,399
and then if we

346
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,000
if we choose the previous one or if we

347
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,240
don't choose the previous one i know

348
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,480
plus the current uh the the number

349
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:14,079
numbers i yeah let's say and i okay

350
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,600
okay so so yeah make sense

351
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,839
all right look

352
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,480
so dpi is that the

353
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:23,360
maximum okay let me repeat maximum sum

354
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,399
of sub array and the index i

355
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,120
right

356
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:29,920
so does it so

357
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,880
dpi minus 1 is here

358
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:35,600
so what does it mean i can choose to

359
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:38,959
include the previous sum right and then

360
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:42,160
i can add this then i have a bigger sum

361
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:44,800
or if i don't choose the previous sum

362
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,880
right because it could be too too small

363
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,040
then i start with the sub array

364
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,160
from the current partition right

365
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,839
yeah

366
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,560
so how can we this is the carbon the

367
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:57,519
dynamic problem how can we apply these

368
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,519
to these to the the problem of today so

369
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,399
first of all okay first of all it can be

370
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,120
trend

371
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,320
uh transform okay so look

372
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:09,360
let's say

373
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:10,639
we have a price today like a a a1

374
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,920
a2

375
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,120
a3

376
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,440
a4

377
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,839
a5 okay let's say this is the

378
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,639
this is the price for the day for each

379
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,639
day

380
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,839
and now we can have another array called

381
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,880
b1

382
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,079
b2

383
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,600
b3

384
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:29,279
b4 b5 okay so what does it equal so b1

385
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,199
is equal to zero

386
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,680
b2 equals to

387
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,279
a2 minus a1 so it's the difference yeah

388
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:39,519
difference between these two numbers

389
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:41,839
yeah so b3 equals a3 minus a2

390
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:46,560
b4 equals one

391
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:49,279
a a4 minus a3 yeah and b5 equals one

392
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:52,480
a5 minus four

393
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:53,600
okay so this is the difference yeah okay

394
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,399
two

395
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,639
zero three five let's say this is a

396
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,639
array and what's b alright b already was

397
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:04,680
yellow and one

398
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,680
and wha what's this value

399
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,679
so how is these two

400
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,760
related

401
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:22,559
so if if i say

402
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:25,120
if i said okay so the lowest point is a2

403
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:28,160
and then the the selling point is a5 so

404
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:31,039
if we want to buy on that a2 and then

405
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:34,080
sell on the a5 then we got the next

406
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,960
profit all right

407
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,880
yeah

408
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,640
okay

409
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,960
uh

410
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,600
yeah so how can we how can we relate

411
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:47,080
these to each each other

412
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,080
so if we

413
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:54,400
okay so if we look if we add these two

414
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:56,480
uh these b2 b3 plus b4 plus b5

415
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,520
right

416
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,360
yeah if b 3 plus b for b plus d psi what

417
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:05,360
do we get

418
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:07,840
a3 minus a3 turns out yeah a4 minus a4

419
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:10,320
might cancel out yeah so what do we have

420
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,480
a5 minus a4 a2

421
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,640
a5 minus a2 you see

422
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:18,880
so this is exactly so we are looking for

423
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:20,320
look this is b3 plus b4 plus b5

424
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,320
is this

425
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,360
and then what is equal it equals a5

426
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,320
minus a2 if i minus 32 so this is the

427
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,080
profit

428
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,720
so what does this mean it means that we

429
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:33,360
need to calculate the longest

430
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,600
the maximum sum of sub array right

431
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,520
yeah and what you can we already know

432
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,760
use the katan algorithm right to solve

433
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,840
this so as long we transform the

434
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,919
original array to this now we can

435
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,840
calculate it's the same thing as

436
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,600
calculating the sum

437
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,200
maximum sum of a

438
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:52,000
sub array right

439
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,000
got it yeah are you with me

440
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,160
this is challenging right mathematic

441
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,600
challenge you want a challenge ryan you

442
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,039
say you want a more challenge are you

443
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,799
with me

444
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:03,039
yeah

445
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:05,360
it's okay you don't follow but you know

446
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:07,440
try to understand okay okay let me

447
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,360
repeat again okay this is a bit tricky

448
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,000
to understand okay

449
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:15,520
the original way the price is

450
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,720
if a2 is the lowest current and a5 is

451
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,600
the

452
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:22,240
max yeah after this though it's fine and

453
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:25,520
then profit we can make is 85 minus a2

454
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:27,919
right yeah example yeah

455
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,640
so if we change from the a to a to array

456
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:32,480
to b array b array b is the difference

457
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,520
contains the difference yeah difference

458
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,000
of each

459
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,799
price of each days now look what do we

460
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,600
get

461
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:43,600
b3 equals a3 minus a2

462
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:47,280
before a4 minus a3 b5 a5 minus a4 if we

463
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:50,559
added b3 plus b4 plus b5 what do we get

464
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:54,400
we cancel only in the determined so this

465
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:57,760
will be equal what b3 plus b4 plus b5

466
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,760
equals a5 minus a4 a2

467
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:02,640
right this is the profit

468
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:05,200
so in other words we are looking for

469
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:08,000
the maximum sum of a sub array because

470
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:10,080
look this is the sub array of the b

471
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,720
right this is the sub array of b we want

472
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,760
to find out the sub array in this b

473
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,039
array

474
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,159
huh

475
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,400
okay

476
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:21,840
okay let's try this and we already know

477
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:24,240
to use this katan algorithm right

478
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,919
the time complexity of categories oh

479
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,960
what

480
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:31,039
oh and whether okay define

481
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,080
next profit

482
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:35,760
oh and usually open for the arrays

483
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,600
going once

484
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,760
right that's all that's that's what it

485
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,200
means ryan do you get it

486
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,039
what means that

487
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,200
there's an array and we need to ask

488
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:48,000
computers to travel

489
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:51,200
just to go once or two times you know

490
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:55,039
constant times even when you go go go to

491
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,880
the half it's still aware right okay

492
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:59,440
doesn't make sense

493
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,679
so this is there are ten ten elements uh

494
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,240
let's say they're ten elements

495
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:07,520
and your accuracy requires to visit each

496
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:09,840
element once like from 1 to 10

497
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,919
you know to some to make a computer some

498
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:15,120
or get the average or whatever

499
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,880
it's all when right okay

500
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,960
max profit

501
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,039
and let's say numbers

502
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,520
first of all we need to prepare okay

503
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:26,640
let's say n equals length this is the

504
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:29,520
number of the elements in the array

505
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:32,000
and answer let's say

506
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,960
at the beginning is zero right

507
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,559
right

508
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,480
yeah and

509
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,520
what do we do for

510
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,919
i

511
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:42,799
in range we start from the first one

512
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:45,840
right one to n

513
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,840
right and then what

514
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,840
oh we need to have another current okay

515
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:54,400
current current equals zero

516
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,400
current

517
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,080
plus

518
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,559
equals

519
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,720
price alarms yeah we want to find the

520
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:05,360
difference numbers i

521
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,600
minus nums i minus one right this is the

522
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:10,080
b array right

523
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:12,960
this is a b right and then if current is

524
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:15,200
smaller than zero smaller than zero we

525
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,240
set it to zero but so now we can rewrite

526
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,400
this

527
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:21,520
so what current

528
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,520
equals max

529
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,159
what

530
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:29,200
makes these plus carbon

531
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:31,840
zero okay and now we can have answer

532
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,720
equals max

533
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:38,520
answer currently

534
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,520
and then return answer

535
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,799
okay

536
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,120
so what's

537
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:49,120
what's the space complexity if we if we

538
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,039
still remember

539
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,400
oh

540
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,799
what's the space are we using any

541
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,600
additional space

542
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,840
no

543
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,799
one or one yeah

544
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,960
look

545
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:03,600
look answer this is the answer the

546
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:06,000
maximum profit this is current right

547
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:08,720
we are looking for the

548
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,480
maximum sub-array right the third result

549
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,000
so the current

550
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,200
current this is the

551
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,840
this is the

552
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,640
sub-array of uh this is the b array

553
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,960
right we calculate difference

554
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,559
calculate difference and we add it

555
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,480
yeah this is the way we take it

556
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:26,880
calculate difference to plus the current

557
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,320
we use the current value or we don't use

558
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,880
it

559
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:36,120
okay we use the current value

560
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:36,120
current value or we don't use here okay

561
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:42,880
yeah i mean does it make sense eric yeah

562
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,960
so which one do you think is better

563
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,400
they're all over all the three algorithm

564
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,530
the first one is proof of thing the

565
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,840
second one is use one we do

566
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:52,320
[Music]

567
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:54,559
remember the lowest point and then

568
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,360
and then the highest point in the future

569
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,600
right

570
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:00,000
and this one is the transform the

571
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,679
original ratio to the

572
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,960
to another problem

573
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,960
yeah they're using the content so

574
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:17,120
the second one and the third one is

575
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:19,600
still exposed away so which one why do

576
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,440
you think i won

577
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,039
the time and space complexity for the

578
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,720
second and the third solution is the

579
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:27,600
same okay

580
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:30,400
make sense yeah

581
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,279
current plus the

582
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,240
yeah

583
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,240
which one sorry

584
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,720
okay

585
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:43,679
any questions so far

586
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,679
ryan any questions

587
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,840
any questions

588
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:59,680
bye
