1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
it up

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:06,160
hello mr miss alright alright

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,600
do we still remember that english yeah

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,720
english like

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:13,280
english

6
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,280
in the increase yeah one is ahead

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,880
and then there's a full stop then we put

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,400
it now here

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,640
okay

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,080
learning this could be one direction or

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,160
both direction if we call this finger

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,679
one direction if not points to neck we

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,920
call it singlet

14
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,480
single yeah

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:38,000
if we post points that both way we call

16
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,640
it doubly yeah make sense yeah

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,960
okay so today given a single is given a

18
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,719
single english yeah

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,480
thing click

20
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,000
we want to delete

21
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,160
the meter of it

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,360
delete the middle of it so what's middle

23
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:56,079
so the first node is the index is zero

24
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,960
but the second is one two three four and

25
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:03,440
we want to we want to delete the middle

26
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:05,280
which is the the the last index like

27
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,720
and divided by 2.

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,360
this this means that to get a flaw right

29
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,439
look what's decimal that's wrong

30
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,799
let's see this make sense

31
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,119
like this

32
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,840
ceiling three point two

33
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,200
equals four

34
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,000
four

35
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,640
[Music]

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,799
three point two equals three okay make

37
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:31,600
sense yeah this means the rounding up

38
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,439
this means knocking down okay so this

39
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,799
corresponds to the

40
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,720
ceil this corresponds to

41
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,759
flaw

42
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:44,079
or in we can convert it in okay

43
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,079
yeah

44
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,840
so

45
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:51,119
look three divided by two 1.5 ceiling

46
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,520
ceiling uh

47
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,240
which is what

48
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,240
okay so actually we the this is to be

49
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,840
the number of the floor nodes with one

50
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,560
two three four

51
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,560
four four divided by two so that we want

52
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,960
to remove this node right we want to

53
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,200
remove this node this is the middle one

54
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,039
even there are four nodes and these two

55
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,680
is the middle of it because according to

56
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,640
this yeah the number of nodes divided by

57
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,760
two

58
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,239
gets flow okay how about

59
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,879
the odd number of the nodes

60
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:25,840
one two three there are three notes

61
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,680
three divided by two

62
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,000
four equals one

63
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,239
right so the one what's one

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,599
one is this this is the meter zero one

65
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,440
two okay

66
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,360
make sense

67
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,480
do you still remember how do we find the

68
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,400
middle node i think this uh how do we

69
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,239
find the internal let's say we want to

70
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,040
find a meter now

71
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,040
how do we find it

72
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:55,440
any idea how do we find the middle now

73
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,440
how do we find this meter now

74
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,680
yeah two pointers okay what are these

75
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,680
two pointers

76
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,200
it doesn't work this way right because

77
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,360
the point at the end you can't point

78
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,159
both ways

79
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,760
right

80
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,360
when the end you can't go back there's

81
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,159
no way to go back so

82
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:19,040
two pointers yeah i have two pointers

83
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,040
they still remember

84
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,000
that's right one is fast the other is

85
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,440
slow fast those two steps at a time

86
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,959
right here

87
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:33,360
look

88
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:35,680
right hand fast reference though okay go

89
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,560
one two go

90
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,560
go

91
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,640
one two go

92
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,440
okay you can't go any further you know

93
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:47,640
which is then so let's slow

94
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,640
this is the meter okay

95
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,210
[Music]

96
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,959
what's this one

97
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,720
turtles

98
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,799
that's the third

99
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,599
character this is one word and another

100
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,599
one is tall

101
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,480
something like that right

102
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,480
yeah

103
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:23,360
uh having a race yeah already runs very

104
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,040
fast but reddit is very proud you know

105
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,280
our rarefield is very

106
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,280
um

107
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,280
yeah and then grab it

108
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,800
thinks okay i'm so fast yeah i can win

109
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,560
anyway so rabbit just takes takes a nap

110
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,479
but the turtle is

111
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,440
keep walking keep walking keep walking

112
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,040
past the past the rabbit and the wind do

113
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,600
you get it so what do you learn from

114
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,600
this story

115
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,560
i mean i mean

116
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,759
don't look down on your opponent right

117
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,320
because if you are recommending a rest

118
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,320
then your opponent is not an opponent

119
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,759
will eventually you know

120
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,120
win yeah

121
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,120
they get it

122
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,199
okay so yeah you are raising a very

123
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,840
interesting point which is the fastest

124
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,840
low pointer so okay so suppose we have

125
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,840
at least i have already

126
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,440
i have already known this point how do

127
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,759
we do this now

128
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,759
how do we get anything out of this chain

129
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,240
so what do we need to how do we delete

130
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,240
it

131
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,680
do we need the access to the previous

132
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,400
now

133
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:36,160
yeah if i have access to fingers now

134
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,160
i can point here the next

135
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,360
to

136
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,199
this thing.net right

137
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,039
so eventually i'll you'll be sent as

138
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,520
cutting off and then i can figure this

139
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,600
right so if this is previous

140
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,280
so i can just say previous dot next

141
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,759
equals

142
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,080
previous dot next equals slow down the

143
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,639
previous the next is original point is

144
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,919
too slow right then i report to slow

145
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,080
down next

146
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,840
and then i can remove the snow

147
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,720
make sense

148
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:08,000
yeah okay make sense so we need to keep

149
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:11,840
checking on the previous by walking so

150
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,440
so every time we walk you know that fast

151
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,360
yes now

152
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,360
don't here but the previous is here

153
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,800
the previous i always we always remember

154
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,400
the previous right update okay and then

155
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,520
let's quickly write it and it will be

156
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,319
easy

157
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,319
it will be easy

158
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,600
so we have to handle a special case what

159
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,720
special case when the note is one only

160
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,039
one note

161
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,039
if this is one or how we if we remove

162
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:45,440
this what then what's the middle note

163
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:47,840
it's itself so if we remove it it will

164
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,840
become

165
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,840
if there are two nuts

166
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,520
what should we return which now we are

167
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,040
going to remove

168
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,400
which is which one is the middle now

169
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:04,400
[Music]

170

one okay so you become

175
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,000
one okay this is two special cases

176
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:23,680
okay let's let's do it define do we move

177
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,960
meter

178
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,919
and we have this hat

179
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,039
if

180
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,240
when

181
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,759
if not

182
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,160
we can

183
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,960
return just return head yeah if we are

184
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,919
given nothing we just return it as it is

185
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,960
if

186
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,080
not

187
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,479
head

188
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,360
dot next right if there is one single

189
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,520
note

190
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,720
now we just return

191
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,960
head on next yeah easy yeah

192
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,120
all right this is two special case if

193
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,639
nothing will return nothing if there's

194
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,440
only one single note then we turn one

195
00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:00,160
thing around now okay

196
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:03,759
previous no equals nothing first and

197
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,280
then we have a fast equals low

198
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,319
equals head

199
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,919
okay

200
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,360
wire

201
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,720
fast

202
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,400
dot next

203
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:18,479
okay why why faster next

204
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:21,680
uh why faster than we do what slow

205
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:24,639
uh fast equal two step at a time yeah

206
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,240
first one next to next right

207
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,039
yeah

208
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,199
that's fast and before we move the slow

209
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:33,919
we do we need to put it store the value

210
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,640
of current as slow into the previous yes

211
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,800
so previous equals love yeah

212
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,760
okay now

213
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:44,720
okay faster next right so here the first

214
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:47,839
drawback is num so it's the the last

215
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,519
note so we we do what look

216
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,640
previous

217
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,839
done next

218
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,680
that's how we did it premise to next

219
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:58,480
equals slow the next because slow is the

220
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,399
middle now now right yeah all right

221
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,440
this is previous

222
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,519
this is

223
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,040
slow which is the middle this is the

224
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,839
middle yeah we want to remove this

225
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:10,240
middle now

226
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,680
yeah this is those next yeah slow down

227
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,120
next

228
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,800
so next

229
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:19,519
okay so look previous stop next equals

230
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,480
next so what did i do now so look after

231
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,080
this

232
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,480
i changed it here previous the next

233
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:27,200
equal slowdown x yeah

234
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,120
then i can i can delete this now right

235
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,080
yeah

236
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,279
did it

237
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,720
df look this is a new new thing you need

238
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,800
to learn today

239
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,160
d

240
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:43,040
means to remove it to to remove it yeah

241
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:46,080
uh so remove it so

242
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:48,320
so just did it uh slow yeah and then we

243
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,519
just return the new head which is the

244
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,360
head

245
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,800
okay

246
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,959
yeah

247
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,360
okay so alright ryan

248
00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:00,560
this bit this bit

249
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,880
yeah you see this bit all right

250
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,800
this bit this bit yeah

251
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,160
this we have learned it before yeah this

252
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,640
is this thing

253
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,079
so today this is the new thing

254
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,959
yeah so

255
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,720
i mean

256
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:15,360
actually

257
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,760
here we need to how do we keep how do we

258
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,839
delete it we want to delete this slow

259
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,079
slow the middle now we we need to know

260
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,920
the previous now right yeah we need to

261
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,480
know previously and how do we find the

262
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:29,839
meter now faster and slower yeah the

263
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:33,040
lighting and tighter rubber rapid

264
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,959
speed 2 the tatters bit one yeah

265
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,519
all right when the rabbit reaches the

266
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:39,440
end the turtle is where is the position

267
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,200
of the turtle

268
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,519
oh in the middle in the middle yeah in a

269
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,079
minute so we are in the middle

270
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,240
in the middle so we before we move it we

271
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:50,880
need to have this previous

272
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,440
yeah previous previous does the previous

273
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,279
equals though remember the position of

274
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,160
the meter and then

275
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,279
please

276
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,279
uh

277
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:01,839
okay so i think

278
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:04,240
previous equals slow okay there is one

279
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,680
slow equal slope of next okay

280
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,519
yeah we

281
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,120
need to move fast equals faster let's

282
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,519
not slow okay

283
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,959
i know we did it we turn it low b yeah

284
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,959
the time constant for the end

285
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,519
we're not using any additional space

286
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:29,040
here instead we can move one stage okay

287
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,600
yeah a little bit guys say bye bye to

288
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,640
people

289
