00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,330

hello

4
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:18,340

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,470

so today we'll talk about remember

8
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:24,480
so today we'll talk about remember
 

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,150
so today we'll talk about remember
yesterday we talked about the binary

10
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:26,160
yesterday we talked about the binary
 

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,230
yesterday we talked about the binary
numbers

12
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:30,240

 

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,990

two days ago we talked about binary

14
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:32,000
two days ago we talked about binary
 

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,709
two days ago we talked about binary
numbers yes final numbers you know

16
00:00:34,709 --> 00:00:34,719
numbers yes final numbers you know
 

17
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,110
numbers yes final numbers you know
zero and one right yeah yeah so if you

18
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:37,120
zero and one right yeah yeah so if you
 

19
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,229
zero and one right yeah yeah so if you
want to

20
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:38,239
want to
 

21
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,709
want to
write a 15 you have to do this one one

22
00:00:40,709 --> 00:00:40,719
write a 15 you have to do this one one
 

23
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,549
write a 15 you have to do this one one
one one right this is 15

24
00:00:42,549 --> 00:00:42,559
one one right this is 15
 

25
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,869
one one right this is 15
in binary right so you can imagine if

26
00:00:44,869 --> 00:00:44,879
in binary right so you can imagine if
 

27
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:45,990
in binary right so you can imagine if
it's a big number

28
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:46,000
it's a big number
 

29
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,389
it's a big number
you should take lots of the one and zero

30
00:00:48,389 --> 00:00:48,399
you should take lots of the one and zero
 

31
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,110
you should take lots of the one and zero
right

32
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:49,120
right
 

33
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,910
right
yes because only we have only two digits

34
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:51,920
yes because only we have only two digits
 

35
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,750
yes because only we have only two digits
to represent the numbers so

36
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:53,760
to represent the numbers so
 

37
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,990
to represent the numbers so
so for example like two 255 255

38
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:58,000
so for example like two 255 255
 

39
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,310
so for example like two 255 255
in decimal three digit but or if we are

40
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:00,320
in decimal three digit but or if we are
 

41
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,910
in decimal three digit but or if we are
using the binary that would be

42
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:03,920
using the binary that would be
 

43
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,270
using the binary that would be
there will be eight ones yeah

44
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:07,280
there will be eight ones yeah
 

45
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,469
there will be eight ones yeah
how do how do i know because two to the

46
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:10,479
how do how do i know because two to the
 

47
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,789
how do how do i know because two to the
power of

48
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:12,799
power of
 

49
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,510
power of
2 to the power of 8 what's that

50
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:17,520
2 to the power of 8 what's that
 

51
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,030
2 to the power of 8 what's that
2 times 2 times 2 times 2 equals

52
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:21,040
2 times 2 times 2 times 2 equals
 

53
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,950
2 times 2 times 2 times 2 equals
60 16 x 16 256

54
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:24,960
60 16 x 16 256
 

55
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,070
60 16 x 16 256
right yeah 256

56
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:28,080
right yeah 256
 

57
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,190
right yeah 256
so 2 to the power of 8 so that will be 2

58
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:31,200
so 2 to the power of 8 so that will be 2
 

59
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,149
so 2 to the power of 8 so that will be 2
to the power a

60
00:01:32,149 --> 00:01:32,159
to the power a
 

61
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,870
to the power a
means 1 in binary that will be that will

62
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:34,880
means 1 in binary that will be that will
 

63
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,749
means 1 in binary that will be that will
be a 0

64
00:01:35,749 --> 00:01:35,759
be a 0
 

65
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,350
be a 0
yeah yeah if i substitute 1

66
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:39,360
yeah yeah if i substitute 1
 

67
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,630
yeah yeah if i substitute 1
minus one minus one that will become

68
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:41,640
minus one minus one that will become
 

69
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,030
minus one minus one that will become
255.

70
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,040
255.
 

71
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,630
255.
if if i minus one from from this binary

72
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:46,640
if if i minus one from from this binary
 

73
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,910
if if i minus one from from this binary
that will be one one one one one one one

74
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:49,920
that will be one one one one one one one
 

75
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,030
that will be one one one one one one one
oh okay

76
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:51,040
oh okay
 

77
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,030
oh okay
all that is missing one one so that will

78
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:53,040
all that is missing one one so that will
 

79
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,149
all that is missing one one so that will
be eight ones

80
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:54,159
be eight ones
 

81
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,069
be eight ones
so that's 255 do you get it yes

82
00:01:58,069 --> 00:01:58,079
so that's 255 do you get it yes
 

83
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,749
so that's 255 do you get it yes
okay so now uh remember uh i think last

84
00:02:01,749 --> 00:02:01,759
okay so now uh remember uh i think last
 

85
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,270
okay so now uh remember uh i think last
time we're missing a

86
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:03,280
time we're missing a
 

87
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,030
time we're missing a
missing uh implementation of to um

88
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:07,040
missing uh implementation of to um
 

89
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,510
missing uh implementation of to um
to convert this decimal into binary for

90
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:09,520
to convert this decimal into binary for
 

91
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,710
to convert this decimal into binary for
example if i want to

92
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:10,720
example if i want to
 

93
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,589
example if i want to
convert list 15 into binary that would

94
00:02:13,589 --> 00:02:13,599
convert list 15 into binary that would
 

95
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,790
convert list 15 into binary that would
be one one one

96
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:14,800
be one one one
 

97
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,030
be one one one
one right so how do we do that we can

98
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,040
one right so how do we do that we can
 

99
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,190
one right so how do we do that we can
just write it define remember we divided

100
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:19,200
just write it define remember we divided
 

101
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,830
just write it define remember we divided
by two

102
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:20,840
by two
 

103
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,830
by two
yeah equals seven remember one

104
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:23,840
yeah equals seven remember one
 

105
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,750
yeah equals seven remember one
yeah three remember remaining one

106
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:27,760
yeah three remember remaining one
 

107
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,550
yeah three remember remaining one
one remaining one and divided by two

108
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:30,560
one remaining one and divided by two
 

109
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,589
one remaining one and divided by two
continue until

110
00:02:31,589 --> 00:02:31,599
continue until
 

111
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,430
continue until
the divisor is zero yeah

112
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:35,440
the divisor is zero yeah
 

113
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,750
the divisor is zero yeah
and then we write it down this way right

114
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:37,760
and then we write it down this way right
 

115
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,550
and then we write it down this way right
yes

116
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:38,560
yes
 

117
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,750
yes
yes yes okay so now define let's call it

118
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:41,760
yes yes okay so now define let's call it
 

119
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,990
yes yes okay so now define let's call it
uh decimal to find binary

120
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:46,000
uh decimal to find binary
 

121
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,190
uh decimal to find binary
so that's n okay so so now we

122
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:49,200
so that's n okay so so now we
 

123
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,229
so that's n okay so so now we
put it in answer as the

124
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:52,239
put it in answer as the
 

125
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,790
put it in answer as the
as a empty string yeah and this string

126
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:54,800
as a empty string yeah and this string
 

127
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,990
as a empty string yeah and this string
now what should we do

128
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:56,000
now what should we do
 

129
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,670
now what should we do
y n is bigger than zero

130
00:02:59,670 --> 00:02:59,680
y n is bigger than zero
 

131
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,270
y n is bigger than zero
right now we can answer equals

132
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:03,280
right now we can answer equals
 

133
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,630
right now we can answer equals
we need to make it as a star right star

134
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:06,640
we need to make it as a star right star
 

135
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,390
we need to make it as a star right star
and divide and remaining two

136
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:10,400
and divide and remaining two
 

137
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,430
and divide and remaining two
yeah remaining two plus answer i don't

138
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:13,440
yeah remaining two plus answer i don't
 

139
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:13,990
yeah remaining two plus answer i don't
need to be

140
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,000
need to be
 

141
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,790
need to be
stopped make it convert this star

142
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:16,800
stopped make it convert this star
 

143
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,710
stopped make it convert this star
function good question start function

144
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:18,720
function good question start function
 

145
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,630
function good question start function
make an integer

146
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:20,640
make an integer
 

147
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,229
make an integer
into a string yeah into a string yeah

148
00:03:24,229 --> 00:03:24,239
into a string yeah into a string yeah
 

149
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,149
into a string yeah into a string yeah
so this is t r is star s clear string

150
00:03:28,149 --> 00:03:28,159
so this is t r is star s clear string
 

151
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,030
so this is t r is star s clear string
so for star it makes an integer into a

152
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,040
so for star it makes an integer into a
 

153
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,390
so for star it makes an integer into a
string a quote

154
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:32,400
string a quote
 

155
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,869
string a quote
yeah a string this is number this is

156
00:03:34,869 --> 00:03:34,879
yeah a string this is number this is
 

157
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:35,509
yeah a string this is number this is
string

158

string
 

159
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,869
string
different types yeah so now look this is

160
00:03:38,869 --> 00:03:38,879
different types yeah so now look this is
 

161
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,550
different types yeah so now look this is
getting the remainder remember one one

162
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:40,560
getting the remainder remember one one
 

163
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:40,949
getting the remainder remember one one

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,270
one getting the remainder into a string
and plus itself so we connect it

168
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:45,280
and plus itself so we connect it
 

169
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,430
and plus itself so we connect it
in the reverse order and then now n

170
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:49,440
in the reverse order and then now n
 

171
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,630
in the reverse order and then now n
is n divided by two right

172
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:52,640
is n divided by two right
 

173
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,869
is n divided by two right
right and then return answer this is the

174
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:54,879
right and then return answer this is the
 

175
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:55,830
right and then return answer this is the
way to

176
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:55,840
way to
 

177
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,710
way to
to basically to convert a decimal into

178
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:58,720
to basically to convert a decimal into
 

179
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,309
to basically to convert a decimal into
binary remember this yeah

180
00:04:00,309 --> 00:04:00,319
binary remember this yeah
 

181
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,789
binary remember this yeah
this is very useful now now today we are

182
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:02,799
this is very useful now now today we are
 

183
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,229
this is very useful now now today we are
going to talk about

184
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:04,239
going to talk about
 

185
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,750
going to talk about
passive decimal hexadecimal

186
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:09,760
passive decimal hexadecimal
 

187
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,869
passive decimal hexadecimal
x thick decimal i

188
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:12,879
x thick decimal i
 

189
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,190
x thick decimal i
probably not how do you write it but

190
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:15,200
probably not how do you write it but
 

191
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,629
probably not how do you write it but
hexadecimal

192
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:16,639
hexadecimal
 

193
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,150
hexadecimal
what does it mean hex hexagon

194
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:20,160
what does it mean hex hexagon
 

195
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,510
what does it mean hex hexagon
hexagon what's that hexagon six sides

196
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:23,520
hexagon what's that hexagon six sides
 

197
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,150
hexagon what's that hexagon six sides
yeah

198
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:24,160
yeah
 

199
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,189
yeah
okay good question this is six

200
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:27,199
okay good question this is six
 

201
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,629
okay good question this is six
yeah this is 10 so how

202
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:30,639
yeah this is 10 so how
 

203
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,909
yeah this is 10 so how
how how many all together 16 16

204
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:33,919
how how many all together 16 16
 

205
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,950
how how many all together 16 16
yeah we're done so hex hexadecimal is

206
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:36,960
yeah we're done so hex hexadecimal is
 

207
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,909
yeah we're done so hex hexadecimal is
16.

208
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:37,919
16.
 

209
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,110
16.
so we're using 16 kind of

210
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:41,120
so we're using 16 kind of
 

211
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,350
so we're using 16 kind of
different character to represent the

212
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:43,360
different character to represent the
 

213
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,870
different character to represent the
number so can you guess

214
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:44,880
number so can you guess
 

215
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,070
number so can you guess
what are the tens so we have zero to

216
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:48,080
what are the tens so we have zero to
 

217
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,230
what are the tens so we have zero to
nine layer ten right

218
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:50,240
nine layer ten right
 

219
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,590
nine layer ten right
and then what's next what's next

220
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:53,600
and then what's next what's next
 

221
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,550
and then what's next what's next
zero can you guess what's after what's

222
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:56,560
zero can you guess what's after what's
 

223
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,270
zero can you guess what's after what's
after

224
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:57,280
after
 

225
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,550
after
zero to nine what's after zero to nine

226
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:00,560
zero to nine what's after zero to nine
 

227
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,749
zero to nine what's after zero to nine
ten uh no no there's no ten ten ten

228
00:05:03,749 --> 00:05:03,759
ten uh no no there's no ten ten ten
 

229
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,950
ten uh no no there's no ten ten ten
is one zero so we're using

230
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:06,960
is one zero so we're using
 

231
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,730
is one zero so we're using
a yeah

232
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:09,740
a yeah
 

233
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:19,749

this is 10 this is 6 we use this 16 kind
of character to represent the numbers

238
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:25,360
of character to represent the numbers
 

239
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,469
of character to represent the numbers
so it's shorter yeah

240
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:28,479
so it's shorter yeah
 

241
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,029

this this this in hexadecimal is 16 look
 

285
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,909
this this this in hexadecimal is 16 look
it equals 1 times 16 times 1 yeah

286
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:37,919
it equals 1 times 16 times 1 yeah
 

287
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,550
it equals 1 times 16 times 1 yeah
yeah plus zero okay yes so you see it's

288
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:40,560
yeah plus zero okay yes so you see it's
 

289
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,629
yeah plus zero okay yes so you see it's
similar yeah

290
00:06:42,629 --> 00:06:42,639
similar yeah
 

291
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,749
similar yeah
okay so it's amina so let's say okay i

295
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:56,150

oh 100 in hexadecimal is how many in

296
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:56,160

 

297
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,150

this decimal 10

298
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:00,160
this decimal 10
 

299
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,990
this decimal 10
in decimal this is the hexadecimal is in

300
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:04,000
in decimal this is the hexadecimal is in
 

301
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,189
in decimal this is the hexadecimal is in
what remember 1

302
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:07,199
what remember 1
 

303
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,469
what remember 1
times 16 1 2 plus

304
00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:10,479
times 16 1 2 plus
 

305
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:18,270
times 16 1 2 plus
0 plus 0. so what's this

306
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:18,280

 

307
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,150

256 yes
 

309
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,790
256 yes
yeah you see yeah how about this in

310
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:22,800
yeah you see yeah how about this in
 

311
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,589
yeah you see yeah how about this in
binary

312
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:23,599
binary
 

313
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,909
binary
how about this infinitely what's that

314
00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:25,919
how about this infinitely what's that
 

315
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,790
how about this infinitely what's that
100 and finally what's that

316
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:28,800
100 and finally what's that
 

317
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:36,390
100 and finally what's that
100

318

327
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,110

so so basically you you just need to

328
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:07,120
so so basically you you just need to
 

329
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,710
so so basically you you just need to
this this stitch times the base

330
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:10,720
this this stitch times the base
 

331
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,950
this this stitch times the base
yeah there are two two positions after

332
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:12,960
yeah there are two two positions after
 

333
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,070
yeah there are two two positions after
that that would be two yeah

334
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:14,080
that that would be two yeah
 

335
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,749
that that would be two yeah
okay don't sing please

336
00:08:17,749 --> 00:08:17,759

 

337
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,230

okay so how about okay now so

338
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:22,240
okay so how about okay now so
 

339
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,110
okay so how about okay now so
so let's write it let's write this hex

340
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:25,120
so let's write it let's write this hex
 

341
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,629
so let's write it let's write this hex
to

342
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:26,639
to
 

343
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,309
to
maximum okay p5 thanks to decimal it's a

344
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:30,319
maximum okay p5 thanks to decimal it's a
 

345
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,709
maximum okay p5 thanks to decimal it's a
similar to binary to the decimal right

346
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:32,719
similar to binary to the decimal right
 

347
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,430
similar to binary to the decimal right
yeah yeah okay let's do the edge okay so

348
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:35,440
yeah yeah okay let's do the edge okay so
 

349
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,829
yeah yeah okay let's do the edge okay so
now we got the answer yeah answer equals

350
00:08:37,829 --> 00:08:37,839
now we got the answer yeah answer equals
 

351
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:38,829
now we got the answer yeah answer equals
zero

352
00:08:38,829 --> 00:08:38,839
zero
 

353
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:44,949
zero
okay

354
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:44,959

 

355
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,790

answer equals answer times what times

356
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:48,800
answer equals answer times what times
 

357
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,150
answer equals answer times what times
what

358
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:50,160
what
 

359
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,350
what
16 16 because we are moving remember

360
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:53,360
16 16 because we are moving remember
 

361
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,910
16 16 because we are moving remember
if it's a maximum move one position to

362
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:55,920
if it's a maximum move one position to
 

363
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,269
if it's a maximum move one position to
the left is times ten

364
00:08:57,269 --> 00:08:57,279
the left is times ten
 

365
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,389
the left is times ten
if it's binary if it's binary is it

366
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:00,399
if it's binary if it's binary is it
 

367
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,230
if it's binary if it's binary is it
times two if the decimal is times what

368
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:04,240
times two if the decimal is times what
 

369
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,030

10 16 plus we need to

370
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,040
10 16 plus we need to
 

371
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,269
10 16 plus we need to
look look we need to map this i to the

372
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:11,279
look look we need to map this i to the
 

373
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,750
look look we need to map this i to the
value so we use the mapping

374
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:13,760
value so we use the mapping
 

375
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,110
value so we use the mapping
mapping let's let's do in my map first

376
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:17,120
mapping let's let's do in my map first
 

377
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,990
mapping let's let's do in my map first
okay then we turn i right return return

378
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:20,000
okay then we turn i right return return
 

379
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,550
okay then we turn i right return return
answer yeah

380
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:22,560
answer yeah
 

381
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,670
answer yeah
but it's and good question this n is a

382
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:25,680
but it's and good question this n is a
 

383
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,949
but it's and good question this n is a
dictionary

384
00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:26,959
dictionary
 

385
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,190
dictionary
so let's let's just do it this way look

386
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:29,200
so let's let's just do it this way look
 

387
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,550
so let's let's just do it this way look
we can just write here

388
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:30,560
we can just write here
 

389
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:49,269
we can just write here
and okay this is bad

390
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:49,279

 

391
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,550

in hexadecimal it could be zero to nine

392
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:52,560
in hexadecimal it could be zero to nine
 

393
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,110
in hexadecimal it could be zero to nine
and a two a to eight

394
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,120
and a two a to eight
 

395
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,590
and a two a to eight
of f now

396
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:01,600

 

397
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,630

is zero we making into zero right and

398
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:04,640
is zero we making into zero right and
 

399
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,030
is zero we making into zero right and
then

400
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,040
then
 

401
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,470
then
one map into one and it's actually nine

402
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:08,480
one map into one and it's actually nine
 

403
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,550
one map into one and it's actually nine
mapping to nine and then a mapping to a

404
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:12,560
mapping to nine and then a mapping to a
 

405
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,990
mapping to nine and then a mapping to a
to ten right b matching to

406
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,000
to ten right b matching to
 

407
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,470
to ten right b matching to
eleven you you could have me yeah that

408
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:18,480
eleven you you could have me yeah that
 

409
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,350
eleven you you could have me yeah that
looks like

410
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:19,360
looks like
 

411
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,269
looks like
14 yeah yeah so another thing is this

412
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:23,279
14 yeah yeah so another thing is this
 

413
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:23,990
14 yeah yeah so another thing is this
could be

414
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,000
could be
 

415
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,910
could be
you could be lowercase as well so

416
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:25,920
you could be lowercase as well so
 

417
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,069
you could be lowercase as well so
instead of doing this

418
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:28,079
instead of doing this
 

419
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,190
instead of doing this
location uppercase we just do this i dot

420
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:31,200
location uppercase we just do this i dot
 

421
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,550
location uppercase we just do this i dot
upper

422
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:32,560
upper
 

423
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,630
upper
yeah i thought upper means to change

424
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:34,640
yeah i thought upper means to change
 

425
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,829
yeah i thought upper means to change
leads to uppercase

426
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:35,839
leads to uppercase
 

427
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,030
leads to uppercase
so a will become a

428
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:39,040
so a will become a
 

429
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,310
so a will become a
right and a is still

430
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:42,320
right and a is still
 

431
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,670
right and a is still
a right and if it's one number it

432
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:45,680
a right and if it's one number it
 

433
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,150
a right and if it's one number it
doesn't

434
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:46,160
doesn't
 

435
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,590
doesn't
have any impact right so we have this

436
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:49,600
have any impact right so we have this
 

437
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,509
have any impact right so we have this
mapping zero to zero one to one

438
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:51,519
mapping zero to zero one to one
 

439
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,269
mapping zero to zero one to one
a to ten b c d e f f fifteen right

440
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:55,279
a to ten b c d e f f fifteen right
 

441
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,630
a to ten b c d e f f fifteen right
and then we'll look it up yeah it's

442
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:56,640
and then we'll look it up yeah it's
 

443
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,550
and then we'll look it up yeah it's
quite similar in binary what

444
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:58,560
quite similar in binary what
 

445
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,030
quite similar in binary what
what's in binary finally remember

446
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,040
what's in binary finally remember
 

447
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,470
what's in binary finally remember
finally to decimal

448
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:02,480
finally to decimal
 

449
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,590
finally to decimal
we just change this to two right yes and

450
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:05,600
we just change this to two right yes and
 

451
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,630
we just change this to two right yes and
then

452
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:06,640
then
 

453
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,509
then
and one and plus i i i could be zero and

454
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:09,519
and one and plus i i i could be zero and
 

455
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,630
and one and plus i i i could be zero and
one so

456
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:10,640
one so
 

457
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,630
one so
finally that would be

00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:11,640

hexadecimal okay all right 16
play 16 we call it backside

500
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:33,680

 

501
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,810

so first of all we need to divide it by

502
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:37,820

 

503
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:45,269

[Music]

504
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:45,279

 

505
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,389

really i'm not sure how do you know

506
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:48,399
really i'm not sure how do you know
 

507
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:53,350
really i'm not sure how do you know
sixteen one sixteen that's nine five

508
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:53,360
sixteen one sixteen that's nine five
 

509
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,550
sixteen one sixteen that's nine five
five ninety five fifteen remaining

510
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:56,560
five ninety five fifteen remaining
 

511
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,829
five ninety five fifteen remaining
five right no no no no no no no oh

512
00:12:59,829 --> 00:12:59,839
five right no no no no no no no oh
 

513
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,110
five right no no no no no no no oh
fifteen fifteen yeah yeah oh

514
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:03,120
fifteen fifteen yeah yeah oh
 

515
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,150
fifteen fifteen yeah yeah oh
fifteen fifteen remaining 15 and divided

516
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:06,160
fifteen fifteen remaining 15 and divided
 

517
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,230
fifteen fifteen remaining 15 and divided
by 16 what's that

518
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:08,240
by 16 what's that
 

519
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,430
by 16 what's that
zero remaining 15. okay so we write it

520
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:11,440
zero remaining 15. okay so we write it
 

521
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,230
zero remaining 15. okay so we write it
this way yeah

522
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:12,240
this way yeah
 

523
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,269
this way yeah
yeah so 15 in hexadecimal is what

524
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:15,279
yeah so 15 in hexadecimal is what
 

525
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:22,470
yeah so 15 in hexadecimal is what
5 1 no no no in hexadecimal

526
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:22,480

 

527
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,829

f f remember f is 15

528
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:25,839
f f remember f is 15
 

529
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,269
f f remember f is 15
right a is 10 oh yeah and then

530
00:13:29,269 --> 00:13:29,279
right a is 10 oh yeah and then
 

531
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,870
right a is 10 oh yeah and then
this this 255 is equals f

532
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:32,880
this this 255 is equals f
 

533
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,750
this this 255 is equals f
in c 16 correct let's try another number

534
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:35,760
in c 16 correct let's try another number
 

535
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,629
in c 16 correct let's try another number

let's try this let's try this let's try
 

541
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:42,949
let's try this let's try this let's try
this

542
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:42,959
this
 

543
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,069
this
uh 100 108

544
00:13:46,069 --> 00:13:46,079
uh 100 108
 

545
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,430
uh 100 108
in 16 in in base 16 3

546
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:49,440
in 16 in in base 16 3
 

547
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,949
in 16 in in base 16 3
6 10 ryan right

548
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:52,959
6 10 ryan right
 

549
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,870
6 10 ryan right
divided by 16 equals one eight

550
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:56,880
divided by 16 equals one eight
 

551
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,790
divided by 16 equals one eight
six six uh

552
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:00,800
six six uh
 

553
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,269
six six uh
remaining 12 right is it

554
00:14:05,269 --> 00:14:05,279
remaining 12 right is it
 

555
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,110
remaining 12 right is it
108. wait wait wait

556
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:09,120
108. wait wait wait
 

557
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,710
108. wait wait wait
it's remaining four no no 696 there will

558
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:12,720
it's remaining four no no 696 there will
 

559
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,990
it's remaining four no no 696 there will
be two 12

560
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:14,000
be two 12
 

561
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,990
be two 12
so remaining 12 right and divided by 16

562
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:18,000
so remaining 12 right and divided by 16
 

563
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,189
so remaining 12 right and divided by 16
that's zero remaining six

564
00:14:21,189 --> 00:14:21,199
that's zero remaining six
 

565
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,550
that's zero remaining six
right so six four sum of

566
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:24,560
right so six four sum of
 

567
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,150
right so six four sum of
four sixteen like remaining twelve

568
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:28,160
four sixteen like remaining twelve
 

569
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,430
four sixteen like remaining twelve
oh twelve what's 12 in in hexadecimal

570
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:31,440
oh twelve what's 12 in in hexadecimal
 

571
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,550
oh twelve what's 12 in in hexadecimal
a b c which number

572
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:34,560
a b c which number
 

573
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,590
a b c which number
12 what do you see 3 10 11

574
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:37,600
12 what do you see 3 10 11
 

575
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,949
12 what do you see 3 10 11
c okay so so this is this is 16

576
00:14:40,949 --> 00:14:40,959
c okay so so this is this is 16
 

577
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,750
c okay so so this is this is 16
okay so let's let's let's try it the

578
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:43,760
okay so let's let's let's try it the
 

579
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,230
okay so let's let's let's try it the
other way

580
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:44,240
other way
 

581
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,750
other way
once this system equals what what in

582
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:47,760
once this system equals what what in
 

583
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,949
once this system equals what what in
texas hex in decimals

584
00:14:50,949 --> 00:14:50,959
texas hex in decimals
 

585
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,069
texas hex in decimals
60 16 equals what

586
00:14:54,069 --> 00:14:54,079
60 16 equals what
 

587
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:57,269
60 16 equals what
equals that's what

588
00:14:57,269 --> 00:14:57,279
equals that's what
 

589
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,629
equals that's what
6 times 16 plus c

590
00:15:00,629 --> 00:15:00,639
6 times 16 plus c
 

591
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,990
6 times 16 plus c
c is 12. so let's look you see

592
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:04,000
c is 12. so let's look you see
 

593
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,990
c is 12. so let's look you see
let's the other way around right yeah

594
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:06,000
let's the other way around right yeah
 

595
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,509
let's the other way around right yeah
yeah okay

596
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:07,519
yeah okay
 

597
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,430
yeah okay
okay so now we we want to write the

598
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:09,440
okay so now we we want to write the
 

599
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,829
okay so now we we want to write the
problem

600
00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:10,839
problem
 

601
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:14,230
problem
define decimal

602
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:14,240
define decimal
 

603
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,790
define decimal
to hexi taxi okay so let's end

604
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:18,800
to hexi taxi okay so let's end
 

605
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,629
to hexi taxi okay so let's end
come on come on remember what we have we

606
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:20,639
come on come on remember what we have we
 

607
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,310
come on come on remember what we have we
have to talk about

608
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:22,320
have to talk about
 

609
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,430
have to talk about
answer equals this yeah well look

610
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:25,440
answer equals this yeah well look
 

611
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,110
answer equals this yeah well look
why and it's bigger than zero talk about

612
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:29,120
why and it's bigger than zero talk about
 

613
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,030
why and it's bigger than zero talk about
mapping yes i will talk about the

614
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:31,040
mapping yes i will talk about the
 

615
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,470
mapping yes i will talk about the
mapping before

616
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:32,480
mapping before
 

617
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,470
mapping before
later okay answer equals answer plus

618
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:36,480
later okay answer equals answer plus
 

619
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,230
later okay answer equals answer plus
no no problem mapping first

620
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:40,240
no no problem mapping first
 

621
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,749
no no problem mapping first
yeah making n plus answer yeah

622
00:15:43,749 --> 00:15:43,759
yeah making n plus answer yeah
 

623
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,389
yeah making n plus answer yeah
and another return answer that's it oh

624
00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:46,399
and another return answer that's it oh
 

625
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:46,949
and another return answer that's it oh
no and

626
00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:46,959
no and
 

627
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,629
no and
n divided equals 16 right

628
00:15:50,629 --> 00:15:50,639
n divided equals 16 right
 

629
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,110
n divided equals 16 right
yeah upper this needs to end modular

630
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:53,120
yeah upper this needs to end modular
 

631
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,710
yeah upper this needs to end modular
modulus16

632
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:54,720
modulus16
 

633
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,949
modulus16
okay return written answer

634
00:15:58,949 --> 00:15:58,959
okay return written answer
 

635
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,870
okay return written answer
so this is basically the same as the

636
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:00,880
so this is basically the same as the
 

637
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,150
so this is basically the same as the
binary but but look

638
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:02,160
binary but but look
 

639
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,470
binary but but look
uh look at this m is a mapping

640
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:06,480
uh look at this m is a mapping
 

641
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,069
uh look at this m is a mapping
mapping this how many possibilities of n

642
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:10,079
mapping this how many possibilities of n
 

643
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:15,189
mapping this how many possibilities of n
modulus 16 how many possibilities

644
00:16:15,189 --> 00:16:15,199
modulus 16 how many possibilities
 

645
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,910
modulus 16 how many possibilities
16 yeah how many possibilities are m

646
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:17,920
16 yeah how many possibilities are m
 

647
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,670
16 yeah how many possibilities are m
modulus 2

648
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:19,680
modulus 2
 

649
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,990
modulus 2
yeah exactly so we need a sixteen

650
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:22,000
yeah exactly so we need a sixteen
 

651
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,910
yeah exactly so we need a sixteen
sixteen so mapping

652
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:23,920
sixteen so mapping
 

653
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,710
sixteen so mapping
equals what zero that would be zero

654
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:26,720
equals what zero that would be zero
 

655
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,509
equals what zero that would be zero
right

656
00:16:27,509 --> 00:16:27,519
right
 

657
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,870
right
one one two three four five nine but now

658
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:30,880
one one two three four five nine but now
 

659
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,629
one one two three four five nine but now
ten remain ten will be

660
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:34,639
ten remain ten will be
 

661
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,150
ten remain ten will be
a right listen listen listen

662
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:38,160
a right listen listen listen
 

663
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,269
a right listen listen listen
okay eleven what's this

664
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:41,279
okay eleven what's this
 

665
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:45,910
okay eleven what's this
eleven what's next

666
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:45,920

 

667
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,990

b yes

668
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:50,000
b yes
 

669
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,110
b yes
uh so 15 is what

670
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:55,120

 

671
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,590

yeah so okay we got mapping what's the

672
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:57,600
yeah so okay we got mapping what's the
 

673
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:13,350
yeah so okay we got mapping what's the
time complexity

674
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:13,360

 

675
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,669

because each number is n every time we

676
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:15,679
because each number is n every time we
 

677
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,270
because each number is n every time we
divide it by 16 right

678
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:17,280
divide it by 16 right
 

679
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,949
divide it by 16 right
yeah yeah every time we divide by 16.

680
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:20,959
yeah yeah every time we divide by 16.
 

681
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:25,590
yeah yeah every time we divide by 16.
so how many 16 you could be log log

682
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:25,600
so how many 16 you could be log log
 

683
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,029
so how many 16 you could be log log
blocks not 16 base n right yeah

684
00:17:29,029 --> 00:17:29,039
blocks not 16 base n right yeah
 

685
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,150
blocks not 16 base n right yeah
so it's like binary is log n if if i if

686
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:32,160
so it's like binary is log n if if i if
 

687
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,190
so it's like binary is log n if if i if
i tell you a number

688
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:33,200
i tell you a number
 

689
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,270
i tell you a number
and i want to convert it to binary then

690
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:35,280
and i want to convert it to binary then
 

691
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,390
and i want to convert it to binary then
it takes log n

692
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:36,400
it takes log n
 

693
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,150
it takes log n
right yeah base two log n

694
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:40,160
right yeah base two log n
 

695
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,310
right yeah base two log n
logarithm we talk about log ten is base

696
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:42,320
logarithm we talk about log ten is base
 

697
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,270
logarithm we talk about log ten is base
two

698
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:43,280
two
 

699
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,990
two
okay it's base two yes but at least it's

700
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:46,000
okay it's base two yes but at least it's
 

701
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,310
okay it's base two yes but at least it's
16 every time we divide it by 16 so it's

702
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:48,320
16 every time we divide it by 16 so it's
 

703
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:48,630
16 every time we divide it by 16 so it's
not

704
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:48,640
not
 

705
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,310
not
16 base and okay where's the base

706
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:52,320
16 base and okay where's the base
 

707
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,390
16 base and okay where's the base
base this is space look remember this

708
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:54,400
base this is space look remember this
 

709
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,350
base this is space look remember this
log x

710
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:55,360
log x
 

711
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,549
log x
y equals a

712
00:17:58,549 --> 00:17:58,559
y equals a
 

713
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:01,110
y equals a
do you understand this is actually you

714
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:01,120
do you understand this is actually you
 

715
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:01,990
do you understand this is actually you
can write it as

716
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:02,000
can write it as
 

717
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,110
can write it as
x x to the power of a equals y right

718
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:05,120
x x to the power of a equals y right
 

719
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,789
x x to the power of a equals y right
yeah remember log 2

720
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:08,799
yeah remember log 2
 

721
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,909
yeah remember log 2
to the power of a log 2 a equals 1

722
00:18:11,909 --> 00:18:11,919
to the power of a log 2 a equals 1
 

723
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,990
to the power of a log 2 a equals 1
remember this equals three because two

724
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:14,000
remember this equals three because two
 

725
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,750
remember this equals three because two
to the power of three equals a that's

726
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:15,760
to the power of three equals a that's
 

727
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,789
to the power of three equals a that's
why we write

728
00:18:16,789 --> 00:18:16,799
why we write
 

729
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,990
why we write
log two to the power to the log base two

730
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:20,000
log two to the power to the log base two
 

731
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,909
log two to the power to the log base two
a is three okay yes

732
00:18:23,909 --> 00:18:23,919
a is three okay yes
 

733
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,350
a is three okay yes
uh no questions

734
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:27,360
uh no questions
 

735
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,990
uh no questions

okay so that
 

751
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,310
okay so that
what's this what's this one one times

752
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:14,320
what's this what's this one one times
 

753
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,990
what's this what's this one one times
ten no i'm talking about sixteen sixteen

754
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,000
ten no i'm talking about sixteen sixteen
 

755
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,029
ten no i'm talking about sixteen sixteen
to the power one yeah plus eight

756
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:21,039
to the power one yeah plus eight
 

757
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,150
to the power one yeah plus eight
so what's this number okay 16 plus

758
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:24,160
so what's this number okay 16 plus
 

759
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,190
so what's this number okay 16 plus
what's this 10 26
