yesterday
 

9
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,230
yesterday
oh um we talked about

10
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:12,240
oh um we talked about
 

11
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,589
oh um we talked about
um what oh if

12
00:00:15,589 --> 00:00:15,599
um what oh if
 

13
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,630
um what oh if
two um binary trees are the same seven

14
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:18,640
two um binary trees are the same seven
 

15
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,429
two um binary trees are the same seven
bananas

16
00:00:19,429 --> 00:00:19,439
bananas
 

17
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,590
bananas
and we're using going back to the video

18
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:21,600
and we're using going back to the video
 

19
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,589
and we're using going back to the video
uh 190 something

20
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:25,599
uh 190 something
 

21
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,630
uh 190 something
how do we check if these the two trees

22
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:28,640
how do we check if these the two trees
 

23
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,349
how do we check if these the two trees
are the same a

24
00:00:29,349 --> 00:00:29,359
are the same a
 

25
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,269
are the same a
and b how do you check it how do you

26
00:00:31,269 --> 00:00:31,279
and b how do you check it how do you
 

27
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:32,709
and b how do you check it how do you
check do you still remember

28
00:00:32,709 --> 00:00:32,719
check do you still remember
 

29
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,790
check do you still remember
color yeah how do we check it do you

30
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:34,800
color yeah how do we check it do you
 

31
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,470
color yeah how do we check it do you
still remember how we earn

32
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:36,480
still remember how we earn
 

33
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,869
still remember how we earn
deficit that's what search okay so first

34
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:38,879
deficit that's what search okay so first
 

35
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,630
deficit that's what search okay so first
of all if we want to check event

36
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:40,640
of all if we want to check event
 

37
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,350
of all if we want to check event
we quickly review a little bit if a is

38
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:43,360
we quickly review a little bit if a is
 

39
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,950
we quickly review a little bit if a is
noun

40
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:44,960
noun
 

41
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,389
noun
and b is noun

42
00:00:48,389 --> 00:00:48,399

 

43
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,830

what should we do return what

44
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:51,840
what should we do return what
 

45
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,270
what should we do return what
if both trees are true okay

46
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:55,280
if both trees are true okay
 

47
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:10,550
if both trees are true okay
and okay if a

48
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:10,560

 

49
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:23,190

a

50
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:23,200

 

51
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,190

okay and then we need to recursively

52
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:25,200
okay and then we need to recursively
 

53
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,270
okay and then we need to recursively
check what

54
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:27,280
check what
 

55
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,310
check what
we need to declare what same and what

56
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:32,320
we need to declare what same and what
 

57
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,950
we need to declare what same and what
we need to recursively check what if

58
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:34,960
we need to recursively check what if
 

59
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,670
we need to recursively check what if
these three

60
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:35,680
these three
 

61
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,670
these three
at this point these two nodes are the

62
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:37,680
at this point these two nodes are the
 

63
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,630
at this point these two nodes are the
same and what what do we do next

64
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:40,640
same and what what do we do next
 

65
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,350
same and what what do we do next
what do we do next we go we push

66
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:45,360
what do we do next we go we push
 

67
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,550
what do we do next we go we push
um what

68
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:48,560
um what
 

69
00:01:48,560 --> 00:02:01,590
um what
a dot left b left same um

70
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:01,600

 

71
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,469

right yeah this is because the time

72
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:04,479
right yeah this is because the time
 

73
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,069
right yeah this is because the time
complexity is on right

74
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:06,079
complexity is on right
 

75
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,869
complexity is on right
yeah the space complexity is also oh

76
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:08,879
yeah the space complexity is also oh
 

77
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,430
yeah the space complexity is also oh
okay so this is stefan search eric look

78
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:11,440
okay so this is stefan search eric look
 

79
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:18,470
okay so this is stefan search eric look
okay every book look at me yeah

80
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:18,480

 

81
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,270

so we compare these we compare these we

82
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:21,280
so we compare these we compare these we
 

83
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,270
so we compare these we compare these we

this yes this is the order
 

87
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,030
this yes this is the order
if we using a breakfast search we

88
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:27,040
if we using a breakfast search we
 

89
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,270
if we using a breakfast search we
compare these

90
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:29,280

these we compare these we compare this
 

95
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,350
these we compare these we compare this
yeah that's the breakfast search

96
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:37,360
yeah that's the breakfast search
 

97
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,030
yeah that's the breakfast search
breakfast okay so let's do it

98
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,040
breakfast okay so let's do it
 

99
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,270
breakfast okay so let's do it
preferences and in question search what

100
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:41,280
preferences and in question search what
 

101
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,949
preferences and in question search what
kind of data structure

102
00:02:42,949 --> 00:02:42,959
kind of data structure
 

103
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,470
kind of data structure
do we need to use q okay so

104
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:46,480
do we need to use q okay so
 

105
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:52,150
do we need to use q okay so
so for example i have a q q what's kill

106
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:52,160

 

107
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,869

first in first first thing

108
00:02:56,869 --> 00:02:56,879
first in first first thing
 

109
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,750
first in first first thing
meaning that okay so if i put it now

110
00:02:59,750 --> 00:02:59,760
meaning that okay so if i put it now
 

111
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,270
meaning that okay so if i put it now
here

112
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:01,280
here
 

113
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,110
here
that at the beginning what should i put

114
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:03,120
that at the beginning what should i put
 

115
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,949
that at the beginning what should i put
with uh should i

116
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:04,959
with uh should i
 

117
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,470
with uh should i
initialize the kiwis i'll vary a load

118
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:08,480
initialize the kiwis i'll vary a load
 

119
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,790
initialize the kiwis i'll vary a load
a load okay so if there are two which

120
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:10,800
a load okay so if there are two which
 

121
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,229
a load okay so if there are two which
route or a pair of loads

122
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:12,239
route or a pair of loads
 

123
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:18,070
route or a pair of loads
which one two loads so what kind of

124
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:18,080
which one two loads so what kind of
 

125
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,550
which one two loads so what kind of
how look if there are two dudes this is

126
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:20,560
how look if there are two dudes this is
 

127
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,990
how look if there are two dudes this is
a this is b

128
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:22,000
a this is b
 

129
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,350
a this is b
so what should we put here initialize

130
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:25,360
so what should we put here initialize
 

131
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,070
so what should we put here initialize
what what kind of thing you put in there

132
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:28,080
what what kind of thing you put in there
 

133
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,789
what what kind of thing you put in there
now it's a node or a player note

134
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:30,799
now it's a node or a player note
 

135
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:42,390
now it's a node or a player note
or

136
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:42,400

 

137
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,750

what kind of data structure is this

138
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:45,760
what kind of data structure is this
 

139
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,630
what kind of data structure is this
uh immutable immutable what's this this

140
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:48,640
uh immutable immutable what's this this
 

141
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,589
uh immutable immutable what's this this
is the list and what do you call this

142
00:03:51,589 --> 00:03:51,599
is the list and what do you call this
 

143
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,350
is the list and what do you call this
this is a list i want this i'm a bucket

144
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:55,360
this is a list i want this i'm a bucket
 

145
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,470
this is a list i want this i'm a bucket
pupa this is called tupac okay super is

146
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:58,480
pupa this is called tupac okay super is
 

147
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,670
pupa this is called tupac okay super is
immutable list okay at least for example

148
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:01,680
immutable list okay at least for example
 

149
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:01,990
immutable list okay at least for example
i

150
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:02,000
i
 

151
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,190
i
i can say x equals a and b and x equals

152
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:05,200
i can say x equals a and b and x equals
 

153
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,750
i can say x equals a and b and x equals
uh this is y equals a and b the

154
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:07,760
uh this is y equals a and b the
 

155
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,789
uh this is y equals a and b the
difference is

156
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:08,799
difference is
 

157
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,990
difference is
that if i count if i can set it x 0

158
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:12,000
that if i count if i can set it x 0
 

159
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,270
that if i count if i can set it x 0
equals c that's okay but i can't say y

160
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:15,280
equals c that's okay but i can't say y
 

161
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,909
equals c that's okay but i can't say y
zero equals c that's not okay because

162
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:17,919
zero equals c that's not okay because
 

163
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:19,509
zero equals c that's not okay because
this is immutable

164
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:19,519
this is immutable
 

165
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,150
this is immutable
constant yeah it means that when it is

166
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:22,160
constant yeah it means that when it is
 

167
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,189
constant yeah it means that when it is
created

168
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:23,199

q r d q okay
so what should i put it give it at the

198
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:12,160
so what should i put it give it at the
 

199
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,950
so what should i put it give it at the
beginning

200
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:12,960
beginning
 

201
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,230
beginning
right so i kind of tube a and b right

202
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:16,240
right so i kind of tube a and b right
 

203
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,990
right so i kind of tube a and b right
yeah look that's how you put a tuber in

204
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:20,000
yeah look that's how you put a tuber in
 

205
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,469
yeah look that's how you put a tuber in
uh in a queue with the bracket is the

206
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:22,479
uh in a queue with the bracket is the
 

207
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,390
uh in a queue with the bracket is the
cheaper in the list

208
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:24,400
cheaper in the list
 

209
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,749
cheaper in the list
and another cheaper thing two point one

210
00:05:27,749 --> 00:05:27,759
and another cheaper thing two point one
 

211
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,430
and another cheaper thing two point one
two point you know it is a three

212
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:29,440
two point you know it is a three
 

213
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,749
two point you know it is a three
it's a cheapo and uh yeah yeah

214
00:05:33,749 --> 00:05:33,759
it's a cheapo and uh yeah yeah
 

215
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,830
it's a cheapo and uh yeah yeah
no no no this is super but this is not

00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:40,800
this means the black parentheses called
 

219
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,070
this means the black parentheses called
function call this is a

function call this is a
this is a function princesses but this

222
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:45,600
this is a function princesses but this
 

223
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,629
this is a function princesses but this
this means that it's a tuba okay why

224
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:48,639
this means that it's a tuba okay why
 

225
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,189
this means that it's a tuba okay why
because look if it's a tuper you got a

226
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:51,199
because look if it's a tuper you got a
 

227
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,070
because look if it's a tuper you got a
you've got nothing

228
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:52,080
you've got nothing
 

229
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,469
you've got nothing
no characters before if it's a function

230
00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:54,479
no characters before if it's a function
 

231
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,590
no characters before if it's a function
n like uh

232
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:55,600
n like uh
 

233
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,469
n like uh
max remember max one two this is not

234
00:05:58,469 --> 00:05:58,479
max remember max one two this is not
 

235
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,469
max remember max one two this is not
your this is getting the one and two

236
00:06:00,469 --> 00:06:00,479
your this is getting the one and two
 

237
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:01,990
your this is getting the one and two
which is the maximum okay

238
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:02,000
which is the maximum okay
 

239
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,790
which is the maximum okay
this is the function call okay okay so

240
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:04,800
this is the function call okay okay so
 

241
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,550
this is the function call okay okay so
now we have a tuple a and b here

242
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:08,560
now we have a tuple a and b here
 

243
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,270
now we have a tuple a and b here
a and b and then what should we do why

244
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:11,280
a and b and then what should we do why
 

245
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:11,590
a and b and then what should we do why
why

246
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:11,600
why
 

247
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,950
why
why why why why

248
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:14,960
why why why why
 

249
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,749
why why why why
you mean still nice investigation

250
00:06:19,749 --> 00:06:19,759
you mean still nice investigation
 

251
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,230
you mean still nice investigation
it's the same as len q is bigger than

252
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:22,240
it's the same as len q is bigger than
 

253
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,469
it's the same as len q is bigger than
zero okay so we're left s2 elements in

254
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:24,479
zero okay so we're left s2 elements in
 

255
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:25,110
zero okay so we're left s2 elements in
the queue

256
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:25,120
the queue
 

257
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,189
the queue
so what should we do we with this we

258
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:27,199
so what should we do we with this we
 

259
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,950
so what should we do we with this we
will take the element

260
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:28,960
will take the element
 

261
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,070
will take the element
in front of yeah so let's take the note

262
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:32,080
in front of yeah so let's take the note
 

263
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,110
in front of yeah so let's take the note
yeah so let's take

264
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:33,120
yeah so let's take
 

265
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,629
yeah so let's take
p and q equals another p

266
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:36,639
p and q equals another p
 

267
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,390
p and q equals another p
because we have q here so let's say

268
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:40,400
because we have q here so let's say
 

269
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,790
because we have q here so let's say
p plus q is the q so let's do it

270
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:44,800
p plus q is the q so let's do it
 

271
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,070
p plus q is the q so let's do it
x and y okay x sub y equals q

272
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,080
x and y okay x sub y equals q
 

273
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,710
x and y okay x sub y equals q
dot one why there's a dot yeah because i

274
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:50,720
dot one why there's a dot yeah because i
 

275
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,110
dot one why there's a dot yeah because i
look

276
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:51,120
look
 

277
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,830
look
i put two elements a two part so i want

278
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:53,840
i put two elements a two part so i want
 

279
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,110
i put two elements a two part so i want
to take it out

280
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,120
to take it out
 

281
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,230
to take it out
put it in x and y pop one

282
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:58,240
put it in x and y pop one
 

283
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,550
put it in x and y pop one
and left pop left yes because if you're

284
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:00,560
and left pop left yes because if you're
 

285
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,830
and left pop left yes because if you're
not saying pop

286
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:01,840
not saying pop
 

287
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,589
not saying pop
if you're not if you just pop what does

288
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:03,599
if you're not if you just pop what does
 

289
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,189
if you're not if you just pop what does

anything he wants no no no no
no a and b you put the b

294
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:14,000

 

295
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,029

yeah pop top means probably right

296
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:17,039
yeah pop top means probably right
 

297
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,710
yeah pop top means probably right
pop right pop left means pop left if you

298
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:20,720
pop right pop left means pop left if you
 

299
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,469
pop right pop left means pop left if you
for the first thing first of all you we

300
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:22,479
for the first thing first of all you we
 

301
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:23,830
for the first thing first of all you we
we want to take this why

302
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:23,840
we want to take this why
 

303
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,629
we want to take this why
does it where why do you just if you

304

just
 

307
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,189
just
put a cute up part why does it do right

308
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:31,199
put a cute up part why does it do right
 

309
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,950
put a cute up part why does it do right
good good question yeah because we have

310
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:32,960
good good question yeah because we have
 

311
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,029
good good question yeah because we have
pop left and then the up

312
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:35,039
pop left and then the up
 

313
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,189
pop left and then the up
the one you don't specify is pop right

314
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:37,199
the one you don't specify is pop right
 

315
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,270
the one you don't specify is pop right
okay so look if we pop right

it will be first thing that's our
 

331
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,110
it will be first thing that's our
eastern stack right okay so we now we

332
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:53,120
eastern stack right okay so we now we
 

333
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,430
eastern stack right okay so we now we
take

334
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:53,440
take
 

335
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,749
take
two elements two nodes in a pair so we

336
00:07:55,749 --> 00:07:55,759
two elements two nodes in a pair so we
 

337
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,749
two elements two nodes in a pair so we
want to compare right like a different

if x is noun
 

343
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,150
if x is noun
and y is num what should we do if that

00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:06,160
and y is num what should we do if that
 

345
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,430

we're just taking the note there may be
 

355
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,629
we're just taking the note there may be
still some notes in the tree we want to

there are two things you can we're going
to skip these and continue so what

368
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:36,800
to skip these and continue so what
 

369
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,070
to skip these and continue so what
keyword should we put

370
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:40,080
keyword should we put
 

371
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,829
keyword should we put
continue our break no no no break this

mean
 

377
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,870
mean
it means that i will skip everything

378
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:48,880
it means that i will skip everything
 

379
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,790
it means that i will skip everything
there and i will go to the

380
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:50,800
there and i will go to the
 

381
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,590
there and i will go to the
loop loop again right yeah continue

382
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:55,600
loop loop again right yeah continue

473
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,430

of the notes comparison and then you

474
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:43,440
of the notes comparison and then you
 

475
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,030
of the notes comparison and then you
will go to the next one right

476
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:45,040
will go to the next one right
 

477
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,389
will go to the next one right
ready yeah does it make sense yeah yeah

478
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:48,399
ready yeah does it make sense yeah yeah
 

479
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,430
ready yeah does it make sense yeah yeah
actually we can we can use these

480
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:51,440
actually we can we can use these
 

481
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,790
actually we can we can use these
as a as a stack we can use it as a pump

482
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:54,800
as a as a stack we can use it as a pump
 

483
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,470
as a as a stack we can use it as a pump
and then it still works it's just the

484
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:56,480
and then it still works it's just the
 

485
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,069
and then it still works it's just the
order will be different right but it

486
00:11:58,069 --> 00:11:58,079
order will be different right but it
 

487
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,110
order will be different right but it
still works

488
00:11:59,110 --> 00:11:59,120
still works
 

489
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,269
still works
but it's not a perfect search it's now

490
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:01,279
but it's not a perfect search it's now
 

491
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,949
but it's not a perfect search it's now
kind of using the stack right

492
00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:02,959
kind of using the stack right
 

493
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,230
kind of using the stack right
we push it and we take it out yeah so

494
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:06,240
we push it and we take it out yeah so
 

495
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,470
we push it and we take it out yeah so
the order of checking the notes doesn't

496
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:08,480
the order of checking the notes doesn't
 

497
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,430
the order of checking the notes doesn't
matter right

498
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:09,440
matter right
 

499
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,829
matter right
because we're always pushing the pair

500
00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:11,839
because we're always pushing the pair
 

501
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:12,790
because we're always pushing the pair
right

502
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:12,800
right
 

503
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,629
right
does it doesn't matter if i check this

504
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:14,639
does it doesn't matter if i check this
 

505
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,910
does it doesn't matter if i check this
note first or least no first

506
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:17,920
note first or least no first
 

507
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,069
note first or least no first
no because like eventually i want to

508
00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:20,079
no because like eventually i want to
 

509
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,829
no because like eventually i want to
check all the notes right all the pairs

510
00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:21,839
check all the notes right all the pairs
 

511
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,190
check all the notes right all the pairs
why did you do left first yeah good

512
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:25,200
why did you do left first yeah good
 

513
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,069
why did you do left first yeah good

every time in the worst case when we
 

559
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,790
every time in the worst case when we
talk about complexity we always talk

560
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:50,800
talk about complexity we always talk
 

561
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,629
talk about complexity we always talk
about it in the worst case we're not

562
00:13:52,629 --> 00:13:52,639
about it in the worst case we're not
 

563
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,030
about it in the worst case we're not
talking about in the best case right

564
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:55,040
talking about in the best case right
 

565
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,389
talking about in the best case right
we're talking about

00:13:56,389 --> 00:13:56,399
we're talking about

00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,269
we're talking about

be you'll feel

571
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,150

maximum yeah

00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:04,160

 

573
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,030

in the worst case let's say uh it's a

574
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:07,040
in the worst case let's say uh it's a
 

575
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,069
in the worst case let's say uh it's a
bit shaky because

576
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:08,079
bit shaky because
 

577
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,110
bit shaky because
i as we said this is a binary tree

578
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:11,120
i as we said this is a binary tree
 

579
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,910
i as we said this is a binary tree
right it's a banana tree and every time

580
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:13,920
right it's a banana tree and every time
 

581
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,629
right it's a banana tree and every time
we

582
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:14,639
we
 

583
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,230
we
keep pushing and then popping right

584
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:18,240
keep pushing and then popping right
 

585
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,829
keep pushing and then popping right
so the note would be uh

586
00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:21,839
so the note would be uh
 

587
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,150
so the note would be uh
if we if it comes to the it will be o n

588
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:26,160
if we if it comes to the it will be o n
 

589
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:31,110
if we if it comes to the it will be o n
you'll be all n

590
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:31,120
you'll be all n
 

591
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:38,310
you'll be all n
n plus n right

592
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:38,320

 

593
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,670

is it uh

594
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:41,680

 

595
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,389

no no i i think it's just all mean and

596
00:14:44,389 --> 00:14:44,399
no no i i think it's just all mean and
 

597
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,350
no no i i think it's just all mean and
because

598
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:45,360
because
 

599
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,030
because
given this time complexity if it's

600
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:47,040
given this time complexity if it's
 

601
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,550
given this time complexity if it's
different you'll be active

602
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:48,560
different you'll be active
 

603
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,030
different you'll be active
right so you'll be o and plus o and o

604
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:51,040
right so you'll be o and plus o and o
 

605
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:51,990
right so you'll be o and plus o and o
mean and

606
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:52,000
mean and
 

607
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,470
mean and
this is the case okay okay

608
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:56,480
this is the case okay okay
 

609
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,509
this is the case okay okay
uh does it make sense here is it the

610
00:14:59,509 --> 00:14:59,519
uh does it make sense here is it the
 

611
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:00,150
uh does it make sense here is it the
same yeah

612
