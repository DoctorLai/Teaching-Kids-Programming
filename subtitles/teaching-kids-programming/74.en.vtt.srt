today we'll talk about power

6
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:10,160
today we'll talk about power
 

7
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,150
today we'll talk about power
up power off sweep

8
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:14,160

the power of three okay so what does it

10
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:16,320
the power of three okay so what does it
 

11
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,670
the power of three okay so what does it
mean it means that

12
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:19,680
mean it means that
 

13
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,509
mean it means that
given the number like 27

14
00:00:23,509 --> 00:00:23,519
given the number like 27
 

15
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,710
given the number like 27
you need to return

16
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:26,720

 

17
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,390

because it is in three times tables

18
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:30,400
because it is in three times tables
 

19
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,870
because it is in three times tables
because it's not exactly in the three

20
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:32,880
because it's not exactly in the three
 

21
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,790
because it's not exactly in the three
time table it's in three to the power of

22
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:34,800
time table it's in three to the power of
 

23
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,709
time table it's in three to the power of
three so it's basically three to the

24
00:00:36,709 --> 00:00:36,719
three so it's basically three to the
 

25
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:37,350
three so it's basically three to the
power of

26
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:37,360
power of
 

27
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,869
power of
x equals n if i give you n

28
00:00:40,869 --> 00:00:40,879
x equals n if i give you n
 

29
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,990
x equals n if i give you n
so it's basically three times one three

30
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:44,000
so it's basically three times one three
 

31
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,029
so it's basically three times one three
three to the power of two nine three to

32
00:00:47,029 --> 00:00:47,039
three to the power of two nine three to
 

33
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:47,830
three to the power of two nine three to
the power of three

34
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:47,840
the power of three
 

35
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,869
the power of three
eight no no look 27 and

36
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:50,879
eight no no look 27 and
 

37
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,430
eight no no look 27 and
what's next three to the power of four

38
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:53,440
what's next three to the power of four
 

39
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,790
what's next three to the power of four
eighty-one right

40
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:54,800
eighty-one right
 

41
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,950
eighty-one right
so basically the three nine twenty seven

42
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:56,960
so basically the three nine twenty seven
 

43
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,470
so basically the three nine twenty seven
81

44
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:58,480
81
 

45
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,029
81
and then you need to tell me it's the

46
00:01:01,029 --> 00:01:01,039
and then you need to tell me it's the
 

47
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,630
and then you need to tell me it's the
it's true alloys is first

48
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:02,640
it's true alloys is first
 

49
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,310
it's true alloys is first
any ideas any ideas

50
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:06,320
any ideas any ideas

00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:09,760
any thoughts uh all you need to do is
 

53
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,550
any thoughts uh all you need to do is
try

54
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:10,560
try
 

55
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,830
try
three to the power of then

56
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:13,840
three to the power of then
 

57
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,870
three to the power of then
um go like one and three

58
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:16,880
um go like one and three
 

59
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,149
um go like one and three
to the power two three zero power three

60
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:20,159
to the power two three zero power three
 

61
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,670
to the power two three zero power three
it is bigger

62
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:22,680
it is bigger
 

63
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,149
it is bigger
[Music]

64
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:24,159
[Music]
 

65
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,390
[Music]
yeah yeah and then if it's if it's equal

66
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:26,400
yeah yeah and then if it's if it's equal
 

67
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,630
yeah yeah and then if it's if it's equal
then one

68
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:28,640
then one
 

69
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,749
then one
okay so look little is zero

70
00:01:31,749 --> 00:01:31,759
okay so look little is zero
 

71
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,990
okay so look little is zero
three power if the input is zero what

72
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:34,000
three power if the input is zero what
 

73
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,190
three power if the input is zero what
happened yeah

74
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:35,200
happened yeah
 

75
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,230
happened yeah
this is yellow uh

76
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:38,240
this is yellow uh
 

77
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,390
this is yellow uh
we can't find it so we're false yeah

78
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:40,400
we can't find it so we're false yeah
 

79
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,350
we can't find it so we're false yeah
yeah

80
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:41,360
yeah
 

81
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,910
yeah
and if it's minus anything you'll be

82
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:43,920
and if it's minus anything you'll be
 

83
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,910
and if it's minus anything you'll be
false yeah right because minus

84
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:45,920
false yeah right because minus
 

85
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,230
false yeah right because minus
negative numbers can't be power of three

86
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:48,240
negative numbers can't be power of three
 

87
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,190
negative numbers can't be power of three
right yeah

88
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:49,200
right yeah
 

89
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,789
right yeah
okay so one how about one a power

90
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:52,799
okay so one how about one a power
 

91
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,429
okay so one how about one a power
one three power of zero this is special

92
00:01:55,429 --> 00:01:55,439
one three power of zero this is special
 

93
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,630
one three power of zero this is special
so one is okay so

94
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:56,640
so one is okay so
 

95
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,429
so one is okay so
look at your equilibrium is quite good

96
00:01:59,429 --> 00:01:59,439
look at your equilibrium is quite good
 

97
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,030
look at your equilibrium is quite good
okay define

98
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:01,040
okay define
 

99
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,389
okay define
power of three power of three okay

100
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:04,399
power of three power of three okay
 

101
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,429
power of three power of three okay
and right yes

102
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:07,439
and right yes
 

103
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,630
and right yes
so look uh if

104
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:10,640
so look uh if
 

105
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,630
so look uh if
n is smaller or equal to zero will

106
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:12,640
n is smaller or equal to zero will
 

107
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,110
n is smaller or equal to zero will
return one

108
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:17,120

 

109
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,309

okay then if n is z one

110
00:02:20,309 --> 00:02:20,319
okay then if n is z one
 

111
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,910
okay then if n is z one
return two right yeah i'm right

112
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:23,920
return two right yeah i'm right
 

113
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,110
return two right yeah i'm right
here okay so now we start from x

114
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:27,120
here okay so now we start from x
 

115
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,990
here okay so now we start from x
start from one okay yes you tell me what

116
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,000
start from one okay yes you tell me what
 

117
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,229
start from one okay yes you tell me what
to

118
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:30,239
to
 

119
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,750
to
what to write y

120
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:33,760
what to write y
 

121
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,869
what to write y
x y what do you say before

122
00:02:36,869 --> 00:02:36,879
x y what do you say before
 

123
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,070
x y what do you say before
if it's smaller if it's bigger

124
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,080
if it's smaller if it's bigger
 

125
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,070
if it's smaller if it's bigger
if it's smaller than n right yeah that's

126
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:44,080
if it's smaller than n right yeah that's
 

127
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,110
if it's smaller than n right yeah that's
what country how do i write to the power

128
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:47,120
what country how do i write to the power
 

129
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,830
what country how do i write to the power
three

130
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:47,840
three
 

131
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,430
three
x can multiply equal three right

132
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:51,440
x can multiply equal three right
 

133
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,030
x can multiply equal three right
and then what's your right here return

134
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,040
and then what's your right here return
 

135
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,030
and then what's your right here return
one term

136
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:55,040
one term
 

137
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,270
one term
return we need to check if x is bigger

138
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:57,280
return we need to check if x is bigger
 

139
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,790
return we need to check if x is bigger
than n or

140
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:58,800
than n or
 

141
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,470
than n or
equal right so what should i put here

142
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:02,480
equal right so what should i put here
 

143
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,550
equal right so what should i put here
no no not written true look at x smaller

144
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:06,560
no no not written true look at x smaller
 

145
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,750
no no not written true look at x smaller
no one now look

146
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:09,760
no one now look
 

147
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,670
no one now look
you just say multiply three multiply

148
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:11,680
you just say multiply three multiply
 

149
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,750
you just say multiply three multiply
three and here is equal or bigger

150
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:13,760
three and here is equal or bigger
 

151
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,869
three and here is equal or bigger
yeah right so and here i'm there are two

152
00:03:16,869 --> 00:03:16,879
yeah right so and here i'm there are two
 

153
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,949
yeah right so and here i'm there are two
situations one is smaller one is bigger

154
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:18,959
situations one is smaller one is bigger
 

155
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,390
situations one is smaller one is bigger
one is equal so

156
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:20,400
one is equal so
 

157
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,030
one is equal so
one is equal is two once this bigger is

158
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,040
one is equal is two once this bigger is
 

159
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,910
one is equal is two once this bigger is
false right

160
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:23,920
false right
 

161
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,430
false right
so what should i like we turn three

162
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:27,440
so what should i like we turn three
 

163
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,630
so what should i like we turn three

n then it's true right yeah yeah i'm
 

169
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,390
n then it's true right yeah yeah i'm
right it doesn't make sense for you

170
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:38,400
right it doesn't make sense for you
 

171
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,470
right it doesn't make sense for you
yeah yeah that's what's the complexity

172
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:42,480
yeah yeah that's what's the complexity
 

173
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,830
yeah yeah that's what's the complexity
yeah oh look at the power 3. yeah look

174
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:45,840
yeah oh look at the power 3. yeah look
 

175
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,180
yeah oh look at the power 3. yeah look
knock three n okay

176
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:47,190

yes okay
 

185
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,869
yes okay
okay look this is going up how about

186
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:02,879
okay look this is going up how about
 

187
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,309
okay look this is going up how about
we're going down

188
00:04:04,309 --> 00:04:04,319
we're going down
 

189
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,670
we're going down
from starting divided by three yeah

190
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:07,680
from starting divided by three yeah
 

191
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,550
from starting divided by three yeah
and until it's one right yeah yeah for

192
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:10,560
and until it's one right yeah yeah for
 

193
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,509
and until it's one right yeah yeah for

example 27
 

195
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,309
example 27
yeah yeah it's multiplied by three like

196
00:04:14,309 --> 00:04:14,319
yeah yeah it's multiplied by three like
 

197
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,150
yeah yeah it's multiplied by three like
i divided by three that's nine

198
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:16,160
i divided by three that's nine
 

199
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,749
i divided by three that's nine
it's multiplied by three divided by

200
00:04:17,749 --> 00:04:17,759
it's multiplied by three divided by
 

201
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,270
it's multiplied by three divided by
three three three

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,310
three three three
three one so if it's one

204
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:22,320
three one so if it's one
 

205
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,469
three one so if it's one
it's uh power three right no you don't

206
00:04:24,469 --> 00:04:24,479
it's uh power three right no you don't
 

207
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,150
it's uh power three right no you don't
need to yeah am right

208
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:26,160
need to yeah am right
 

209
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,310
need to yeah am right
yeah okay so this is the same yeah look

00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:28,320
yeah okay so this is the same yeah look
 

211
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,150
yeah okay so this is the same yeah look
we can do this

212
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:30,160
we can do this

223
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:15,670

right let's return what the

224
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:15,680

 

225
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,070

229
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:48,230

actually you can divide it but you

230
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:48,240

 

231
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,270

so look this can be written in recursion

232
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:51,280
so look this can be written in recursion
 

233
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,950
so look this can be written in recursion
yeah how do we write it but

234
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:52,960
yeah how do we write it but
 

235
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,510
yeah how do we write it but
that's a college this is the question

236
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:55,520
that's a college this is the question
 

237
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,110
that's a college this is the question
look

238
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:57,120
look
 

239
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,950
look
can you be good all right

240
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:00,960
can you be good all right
 

241
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,629
can you be good all right
look we can do it in retesting look

242
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:02,639
look we can do it in retesting look
 

243
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,950
look we can do it in retesting look
return

244
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:04,960
return
 

245
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,870
return
return and divided by three can be

246
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:08,880
return and divided by three can be
 

247
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,070
return and divided by three can be
divided by three

248
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,080
divided by three
 

249
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,110
divided by three
yeah equal and

250
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:13,120
yeah equal and
 

251
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,150
yeah equal and
so and no you don't need the right power

252
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:16,160
so and no you don't need the right power
 

253
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,710
so and no you don't need the right power
three

254
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:16,720
three
 

255
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:27,909
three
and one how

256
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:27,919

 

257
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,390

yeah okay okay good job this is one way

258
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:30,400
yeah okay okay good job this is one way
 

259
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,110
yeah okay okay good job this is one way
of doing

260
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:31,120
of doing
 

261
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,909
of doing
how about

262
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:35,919

 

263
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,029

all right all right look 3 to the power

264
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:39,039
all right all right look 3 to the power
 

265
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:39,510
all right all right look 3 to the power
of x

266
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:39,520
of x
 

267
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,550
of x
equals n right so how can we write it we

268
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:42,560
equals n right so how can we write it we
 

269
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,749
equals n right so how can we write it we
can write it

270
00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:43,759
can write it
 

271
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,830
can write it
x equals 1 log

272
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:46,840
x equals 1 log
 

273
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,469
x equals 1 log
3 n right yes

274
00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:50,479
3 n right yes
 

275
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,110
3 n right yes
yes 3 to the power of x equals n and x

276
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:53,120
yes 3 to the power of x equals n and x
 

277
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,670
yes 3 to the power of x equals n and x
is

278
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:53,680
is
 

279
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,350
is
not 3 n right yes yeah

280
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:57,360
not 3 n right yes yeah
 

281
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,309
not 3 n right yes yeah
ok so if we calculate this function

282
00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:00,319
ok so if we calculate this function
 

283
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,270
ok so if we calculate this function
because we don't have

284
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:01,280
because we don't have
 

285
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,790
because we don't have
log block three but we have log two

286
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:04,800
log block three but we have log two
 

287
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,670
log block three but we have log two
and we have a lot of ten okay these two

288
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:07,680
and we have a lot of ten okay these two
 

289
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,350
and we have a lot of ten okay these two
functions are available

290
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:09,360
functions are available
 

291
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,550
functions are available
and then why because in mathematics in

292
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:12,560
and then why because in mathematics in
 

293
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,110
and then why because in mathematics in
computer knows these two functions

294
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:15,120
computer knows these two functions
 

295
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,550
computer knows these two functions
and possibly then you can convert this

296
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:18,560
and possibly then you can convert this
 

297
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,870
and possibly then you can convert this
to this but it's a bit tricky okay

298
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:20,880
to this but it's a bit tricky okay
 

299
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,909
to this but it's a bit tricky okay
it's a bit tricky

300
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:23,919

 

301
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,990

it's a bit tricky how how do we compute

302
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:26,000
it's a bit tricky how how do we compute
 

303
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,909
it's a bit tricky how how do we compute
the left the log

304
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:27,919
the left the log
 

305
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,670
the left the log
a b right equals

306
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:31,680
a b right equals
 

307
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,189
a b right equals
log 2 you can choose any base yeah

308
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:35,199
log 2 you can choose any base yeah
 

309
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,390
log 2 you can choose any base yeah
base c b divided by

310
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:38,400
base c b divided by
 

311
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,150
base c b divided by
log c as long as the same base okay

312
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:42,160
log c as long as the same base okay
 

313
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,350
log c as long as the same base okay
okay so these can can be converted to

314
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:45,360
okay so these can can be converted to
 

315
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,430
okay so these can can be converted to
log two and divided by log two

316
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:49,440
log two and divided by log two
 

317
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,869
log two and divided by log two
three okay yes you just need to know and

318
00:07:52,869 --> 00:07:52,879
three okay yes you just need to know and
 

319
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,950
three okay yes you just need to know and
if we calculate this number

320
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:54,960
if we calculate this number
 

321
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,270
if we calculate this number
and as it's a voltage number then if we

322
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:57,280
and as it's a voltage number then if we
 

323
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,309
and as it's a voltage number then if we
can

324
00:07:58,309 --> 00:07:58,319
can
 

325
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,710
can
compute its integer path yeah integer

326
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:00,720
compute its integer path yeah integer
 

327
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,670
compute its integer path yeah integer
part

328
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:01,680
part
 

329
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,909
part
and then let's say if x is in the value

330
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:03,919
and then let's say if x is in the value
 

331
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:04,710
and then let's say if x is in the value
then we can just

332
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:04,720
then we can just
 

333
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,909
then we can just
write between three times times x

334
00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:07,919
write between three times times x
 

335
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,029
write between three times times x
equals n return less thing okay

336
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:11,039
equals n return less thing okay
 

337
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,950
equals n return less thing okay
you don't need to understand fully but

338
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:12,960
you don't need to understand fully but
 

339
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,309
you don't need to understand fully but
you just have to

340
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:14,319
you just have to
 

341
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,070
you just have to
see that that's the one solution of

342
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,080
see that that's the one solution of
 

343
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,070
see that that's the one solution of
using mathematics okay

344
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:18,080
using mathematics okay
 

345
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:23,350
using mathematics okay
how about final research

346
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:23,360

 

347
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,510

remember we talk about binary search

348
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:25,520
remember we talk about binary search
 

349
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,469
remember we talk about binary search
yeah

350
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:26,479
yeah
 

351
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,150
yeah
yeah so look define you tell me okay

352
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:30,160
yeah so look define you tell me okay
 

353
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:35,509
yeah so look define you tell me okay
power of three and right

354
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:35,519

 

355
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:50,070

the same if n smaller than zero

356
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:50,080

 

357
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,470

right left right equal left will be zero

358
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:52,480
right left right equal left will be zero
 

359
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,430
right left right equal left will be zero
right will be n

360
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:53,440
right will be n
 

361
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,870
right will be n
okay yeah two boundary okay

362
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:56,880
okay yeah two boundary okay
 

363
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,230
okay yeah two boundary okay
why why why

364
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:00,240
why why why
 

365
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,230
why why why
l smaller equals r why this two range is

366
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:04,240
l smaller equals r why this two range is
 

367
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,509
l smaller equals r why this two range is
not meeting in the middle

368
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:05,519
not meeting in the middle
 

369
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,190
not meeting in the middle
yeah meat means equals what

370
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:09,200
yeah meat means equals what
 

371
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,870
yeah meat means equals what
we cut left and right what's the meter

372
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:12,880
we cut left and right what's the meter
 

373
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,990
we cut left and right what's the meter
uh what's the meter

374
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:16,000
uh what's the meter
 

375
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,590
uh what's the meter
that's three that's four that's what's

376
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:17,600
that's three that's four that's what's
 

377
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:23,110
that's three that's four that's what's
in the middle four

378
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:23,120

 

379
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,150

yeah right divided by two okay let's

380
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,160
yeah right divided by two okay let's
 

381
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,350
yeah right divided by two okay let's
meet up yeah

382
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:27,360
meet up yeah
 

383
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,110
meet up yeah
yeah okay

384
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:31,120
yeah okay
 

385
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,829
yeah okay
let's calculate this pick n value yeah n

386
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:33,839
let's calculate this pick n value yeah n
 

387
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,190
let's calculate this pick n value yeah n
equals three

388
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:35,200
equals three
 

389
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,470
equals three
times meat what does it mean 3 to the

390
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:38,480
times meat what does it mean 3 to the
 

391
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,470
times meat what does it mean 3 to the
power of

392
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:40,480
power of
 

393
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,870
power of
3 to the power of meter yeah this is the

394
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:42,880
3 to the power of meter yeah this is the
 

395
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,150
3 to the power of meter yeah this is the
same thing as power

396
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:44,160
same thing as power
 

397
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,150
same thing as power
you can use this 3 power meat it's the

398
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:46,160
you can use this 3 power meat it's the
 

399
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,310
you can use this 3 power meat it's the
same thing okay you can write it like

400
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:48,320
same thing okay you can write it like
 

401
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,670
same thing okay you can write it like
as well right then i calculate this mean

402
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:51,680
as well right then i calculate this mean
 

403
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:57,110
as well right then i calculate this mean
okay now if n equals

404
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,120
okay now if n equals
 

405
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,990
okay now if n equals
if n equals n what's your should we

406
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:00,000
if n equals n what's your should we
 

407
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,389
if n equals n what's your should we
return

408
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:00,399
return
 

409
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,509
return
10 minutes if n equals n what will

410
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:03,519
10 minutes if n equals n what will
 

411
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,470
10 minutes if n equals n what will
return

412
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:04,480
return
 

413
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,750
return
if n is bigger than n no power no if

414
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:07,760
if n is bigger than n no power no if
 

415
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,790
if n is bigger than n no power no if
n is n yeah because we found a value

416
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:12,800
n is n yeah because we found a value
 

417
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,990
n is n yeah because we found a value
if n if this value

418
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,000
if n if this value
 

419
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,430
if n if this value
is bigger than uh n what does it mean

420
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:21,440

 

421
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,310

no no no final research remember we need

422
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:24,320
no no no final research remember we need
 

423
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:24,870
no no no final research remember we need
to

424
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:24,880
to
 

425
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,110
to
we need to look this is air this is r

426
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:29,120
we need to look this is air this is r
 

427
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,870
we need to look this is air this is r
and this is it yeah if if this is the

428
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:32,880
and this is it yeah if if this is the
 

429
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,069
and this is it yeah if if this is the
bigger

430
00:10:34,069 --> 00:10:34,079
bigger
 

431
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,190
bigger
please if this is bigger than then

432
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:37,200
please if this is bigger than then
 

433
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,949
please if this is bigger than then
the value will we want to find

434
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:40,959
the value will we want to find
 

435
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,230
the value will we want to find
is we eat now if this is the bigger than

436
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:44,240
is we eat now if this is the bigger than
 

437
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,430
is we eat now if this is the bigger than
what we want to find you go

438
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:47,440
what we want to find you go
 

439
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,630
what we want to find you go
go yeah is equal to if this 3 to the

440
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:50,640
go yeah is equal to if this 3 to the
 

441
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,269
go yeah is equal to if this 3 to the
power of

442
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:51,279
power of
 

443
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,470
power of
meat yeah is actually bigger than

444
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:54,480
meat yeah is actually bigger than
 

445
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,269
meat yeah is actually bigger than
the 3 power to the power of x right we

446
00:10:57,269 --> 00:10:57,279
the 3 power to the power of x right we
 

447
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,790
the 3 power to the power of x right we
want to find the x yeah

448
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:58,800
want to find the x yeah
 

449
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,110
want to find the x yeah
so the value must be in here all right

450
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:01,120
so the value must be in here all right
 

451
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,310
so the value must be in here all right
yeah

452
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:02,320
yeah
 

453
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:08,550
yeah
so ah

454
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:08,560

 

455
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,030

ah out here i equals what we don't move

456
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:11,040
ah out here i equals what we don't move
 

457
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,350
ah out here i equals what we don't move
here i equals one

458
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:13,360
here i equals one
 

459
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,509
here i equals one
minus one yes and then es if it's

460
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:17,519
minus one yes and then es if it's
 

461
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,150
minus one yes and then es if it's
smaller

462
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:18,160
smaller
 

463
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,230
smaller
if it's smaller then it should be in

464
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:20,240
if it's smaller then it should be in
 

465
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,190
if it's smaller then it should be in
this range yeah

466
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:21,200
this range yeah
 

467
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,710
this range yeah
so what else

468
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:24,720

 

469
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,949

left equals made that one where the hell

470
00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:28,959
left equals made that one where the hell
 

471
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,470
left equals made that one where the hell
and then what is when we can't find the

472
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:32,480
and then what is when we can't find the
 

473
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,470
and then what is when we can't find the
value return what

474
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:34,480
value return what
 

475
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,670
value return what
false identifier yeah

476
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:39,680

 

477
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:52,310

what's the time complexity

478
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:52,320

 

479
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,590

no what's your answer

480
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:55,600
no what's your answer
 

481
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,110
no what's your answer
final research is not

482
00:11:59,110 --> 00:11:59,120

 

483
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,269

not yeah yeah however

484
00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:03,279
not yeah yeah however
 

485
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:07,030
not yeah yeah however
however look at this this needs time

486
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:07,040
however look at this this needs time
 

487
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,150
however look at this this needs time
right

488
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:08,160
right
 

489
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,069
right
country 3 to the power of mid

490
00:12:12,069 --> 00:12:12,079
country 3 to the power of mid
 

491
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,829
country 3 to the power of mid
remember we talked about how to

492
00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:13,839
remember we talked about how to
 

493
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,509
remember we talked about how to
calculate the power function using the

494
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:15,519
calculate the power function using the
 

495
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:16,710
calculate the power function using the
binary search

496
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:16,720
binary search
 

497
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,470
binary search
yeah remember remember we talked about 2

498
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:20,480
yeah remember remember we talked about 2
 

499
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,389
yeah remember remember we talked about 2
to the power of

500
00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:22,399
to the power of
 

501
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,350
to the power of

5 equals 2 to the power 4 times 4 2
 

503
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:25,910
5 equals 2 to the power 4 times 4 2
right

504
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:25,920
right
 

505
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,150
right
2 to the power 2 4 equals 2 to the power

506
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:28,160
2 to the power 2 4 equals 2 to the power
 

507
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,069
2 to the power 2 4 equals 2 to the power
of 2 times 2 to the power 2 right

508
00:12:30,069 --> 00:12:30,079
of 2 times 2 to the power 2 right
 

509
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,670
of 2 times 2 to the power 2 right
remember we talked about this

510
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:31,680
remember we talked about this
 

511
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,389
remember we talked about this
previously right so we need we this

512
00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:34,399
previously right so we need we this
 

513
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,230
previously right so we need we this
needs the log end as well

514
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:36,240
needs the log end as well
 

515
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,389
needs the log end as well
yeah it does not come free you just

516
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:38,399
yeah it does not come free you just
 

517
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,670
yeah it does not come free you just
cannot calculate it

518
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:39,680
cannot calculate it
 

519
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,310
cannot calculate it
in one constant time right the computer

520
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:42,320
in one constant time right the computer
 

521
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,629
in one constant time right the computer
needs the o log n to find the

522
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:44,639
needs the o log n to find the
 

523
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,350
needs the o log n to find the
power function right so that would be

524
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:47,360
power function right so that would be
 

525
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,069
power function right so that would be
log

526
00:12:48,069 --> 00:12:48,079
log
 

527
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,670
log
o log n square

528
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:51,680
o log n square
 

529
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,829
o log n square
okay this is a bit tricky but final

530
00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:53,839
okay this is a bit tricky but final
 

531
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,310
okay this is a bit tricky but final
research right look final research log n

532
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:56,320
research right look final research log n
 

533
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,110
research right look final research log n
right

534
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:57,120
right
 

535
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,829
right
yeah every time i divide into half right

536
00:12:59,829 --> 00:12:59,839
yeah every time i divide into half right
 

537
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:00,870
yeah every time i divide into half right
square

538
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:00,880
square
 

539
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,990
square
yeah define your half half

540
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:04,000
yeah define your half half
 

541
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,269
yeah define your half half
half yes and then

542
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:07,279
half yes and then
 

543
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:12,629
half yes and then
this is by the research okay so

544
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:12,639

 

545
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,030

you want you want me to raise some up

546
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:15,040
you want you want me to raise some up
 

547
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,870
you want you want me to raise some up
some bitterly and you feel a blank or

548
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:16,880
some bitterly and you feel a blank or
 

549
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,629
some bitterly and you feel a blank or
you want to erase everything and you

550
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:18,639
you want to erase everything and you
 

551
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,470
you want to erase everything and you
write one of the approach i just

552
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:20,480
write one of the approach i just
 

553
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,110
write one of the approach i just
talk about which one which one do you

554
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:23,120
talk about which one which one do you
 

555
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,310
talk about which one which one do you
prefer

556
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:24,320
prefer
 

557
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,230
prefer
which one do you who do you want to come

558
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:26,240
which one do you who do you want to come
 

559
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,590
which one do you who do you want to come
first you you want to change

560
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:29,600
first you you want to change
 

561
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:46,470
first you you want to change
yeah yes or no i want that

562
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:46,480

 

563
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,990

turn around okay i'm going to raise this

564
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:50,000
turn around okay i'm going to raise this
 

565
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,310
turn around okay i'm going to raise this
okay can you tell me what should i put

566
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:52,320
okay can you tell me what should i put
 

567
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,189
okay can you tell me what should i put
here

568
00:13:57,189 --> 00:13:57,199

 

569
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,069

if n equals n we find it we should one

570
00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:00,079
if n equals n we find it we should one
 

571
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:26,949

bigger than yeah
bigger than that as long as this number

590
00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:52,399
bigger than that as long as this number
 

591
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,230
bigger than that as long as this number
is bigger than three to the power of s

592
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:54,240
is bigger than three to the power of s
