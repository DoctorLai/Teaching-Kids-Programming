00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,870

so today we talk we want to talk about

2
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:14,880
so today we talk we want to talk about
 

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,150
so today we talk we want to talk about
something uh interesting problem is that

4
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:18,160
something uh interesting problem is that
 

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,630
something uh interesting problem is that
to check if the leaves you know the

6
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:20,640
to check if the leaves you know the
 

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,230
to check if the leaves you know the
leaves in the binary tree

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:22,240
leaves in the binary tree
 

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,109
leaves in the binary tree
yeah they're all on the if they're on

10
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:25,119
yeah they're all on the if they're on
 

11
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:26,310
yeah they're all on the if they're on
the same level so

12
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:26,320
the same level so
 

13
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,349
the same level so
look at this one okay

14
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:31,359
look at this one okay
 

15
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,110
look at this one okay
yeah yeah this is the the the levels

16
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:35,120
yeah yeah this is the the the levels
 

17
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,790
yeah yeah this is the the the levels
look this is yellow

18
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:38,800
look this is yellow
 

19
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,069
look this is yellow
this is one so look where are the leaves

20
00:00:42,069 --> 00:00:42,079
this is one so look where are the leaves
 

21
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,670
this is one so look where are the leaves
the leaves leaves

22
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:45,680
the leaves leaves
 

23
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,350
the leaves leaves
leaves leaves this is improved

24
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:49,360
leaves leaves this is improved
 

25
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,389
leaves leaves this is improved
this is the finger yeah yes

26
00:00:52,389 --> 00:00:52,399
this is the finger yeah yes
 

27
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,029
this is the finger yeah yes
so the leaves are level one so you need

28
00:00:55,029 --> 00:00:55,039
so the leaves are level one so you need
 

29
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,350
so the leaves are level one so you need
to return to and how about this

30
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:57,360
to return to and how about this
 

31
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,549
to return to and how about this
listen up yeah what are the leaves

32
00:01:00,549 --> 00:01:00,559
listen up yeah what are the leaves
 

33
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,990
listen up yeah what are the leaves
where on the list no this is not that

34
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:04,000
where on the list no this is not that
 

35
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,549
where on the list no this is not that
deep

36
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:04,559
deep
 

37
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,720
deep
so what's this remind me what's leaf

38
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:07,730
so what's this remind me what's leaf
 

39
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,870
so what's this remind me what's leaf

43
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,630

does not have any triad yes exactly so

44
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:18,640
does not have any triad yes exactly so
 

45
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,550
does not have any triad yes exactly so
it does not have any child okay

46
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:20,560
it does not have any child okay
 

47
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,670
it does not have any child okay
so now we're done so given the final

48
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:23,680
so now we're done so given the final
 

49
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,070
so now we're done so given the final
tree

50
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:24,080
tree
 

51
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,109
tree
so how can we make

52
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:27,119
so how can we make
 

53
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,030
so how can we make
coffee and check if our leaves are on

54
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:29,040
coffee and check if our leaves are on
 

55
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,670
coffee and check if our leaves are on
the same level

56
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:33,680

 

57
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,830

uh just give me any thoughts how do we

58
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:35,840
uh just give me any thoughts how do we
 

59
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,870
uh just give me any thoughts how do we
check any

60
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:36,880
check any
 

61
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,590
check any
if there are only seven and remember how

62
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:39,600
if there are only seven and remember how
 

63
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,230
if there are only seven and remember how
many ways we can

64
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:42,240
many ways we can
 

65
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,630
many ways we can
it can travel all the notes in the

66
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:44,640
it can travel all the notes in the
 

67
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,990
it can travel all the notes in the
binary tree

68
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,000
binary tree
 

69
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,590
binary tree
how many ways

70
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:49,600

 

71
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,870

yeah do you still remember this

72
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:52,880
yeah do you still remember this
 

73
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,600
yeah do you still remember this

okay today we talked about that versus
 

79
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,109
okay today we talked about that versus
to solve this problem yeah we talked

80
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:03,119
to solve this problem yeah we talked
 

81
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,550
to solve this problem yeah we talked
about that before and

82
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:04,560
about that before and
 

83
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,550
about that before and
tomorrow we talk about breakfast search

84
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:06,560
tomorrow we talk about breakfast search
 

85
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,550
tomorrow we talk about breakfast search
okay breakfast that makes me

86
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:08,560
okay breakfast that makes me
 

87
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:14,949
okay breakfast that makes me
hungry yeah that's research so what's d

88
00:02:14,949 --> 00:02:14,959

95
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,509

so look one

96
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:51,519
so look one
 

97
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,470
so look one
two three so remember

98
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:56,480
two three so remember
 

99
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,830
two three so remember
so it's like a different searches

100
00:02:59,830 --> 00:02:59,840
so it's like a different searches
 

101
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:14,470
so it's like a different searches
is pre-order right

102
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:14,480

 

103
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,430

okay and how about this if i have a five

104
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:17,440
okay and how about this if i have a five
 

105
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,990
okay and how about this if i have a five
here so what's the sequence

106
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:20,000
here so what's the sequence
 

107
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,190
here so what's the sequence
there's six what's the sequence

108
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:23,200
there's six what's the sequence
 

109
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,789
there's six what's the sequence
one two three

110
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:26,799
one two three
 

111
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,470
one two three
five four six seven so

112
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:30,480
five four six seven so
 

113
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,390
five four six seven so
basically we visit there then

114
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:34,400
basically we visit there then
 

115
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,830
basically we visit there then
we so basically we can go down as

116
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:37,840
we so basically we can go down as
 

117
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,869
we so basically we can go down as
deep as we can right yeah and if we know

118
00:03:40,869 --> 00:03:40,879
deep as we can right yeah and if we know
 

119
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,630
deep as we can right yeah and if we know
we cannot go deep

120
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:42,640
we cannot go deep
 

121
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,990
we cannot go deep
then we go how do we go left sorry why

122
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,000
then we go how do we go left sorry why
 

123
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,789
then we go how do we go left sorry why
do we go there

124
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:46,799
do we go there
 

125
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,149
do we go there
yes go left first of all let's go left

126
00:03:50,149 --> 00:03:50,159
yes go left first of all let's go left
 

127
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,190
yes go left first of all let's go left
as deep as we want as we can and not

128
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:53,200
as deep as we want as we can and not
 

129
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,270
as deep as we want as we can and not
even we cannot go deep so we are now at

130
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:55,280
even we cannot go deep so we are now at
 

131
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,350
even we cannot go deep so we are now at
three we cannot thirty we go back

132
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:57,360
three we cannot thirty we go back
 

133
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,190
three we cannot thirty we go back
and then we go right so basically

134
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:01,200
and then we go right so basically
 

135
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,390
and then we go right so basically
is the loot so it's

136
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:04,400
is the loot so it's
 

137
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,830
is the loot so it's
what loot

138
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:09,840

 

139
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,270

left right actually that's the value so

140
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:13,280
left right actually that's the value so
 

141
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,750
left right actually that's the value so
let's and that's the

142
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:15,760
let's and that's the
 

143
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,189
let's and that's the
value current value

144
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:19,199
value current value
 

145
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,030
value current value
so what's this what's this this is

146
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:21,040
so what's this what's this this is
 

147
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,390
so what's this what's this this is
pre-order right this is kind of

148
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:22,400
pre-order right this is kind of
 

149
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,510
pre-order right this is kind of
pre-order

150
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:23,520
pre-order
 

151
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,909
pre-order
do you still remember that in order in

152
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:25,919
do you still remember that in order in
 

153
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,550
do you still remember that in order in
order is what

154
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:28,560
order is what
 

155
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,590
order is what
l v r yeah first order is what

156
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:33,600
l v r yeah first order is what
 

157
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,830
l v r yeah first order is what
post order is

158
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:37,840
post order is
 

159
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,909
post order is
so when we talk about the sequences we

160
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:39,919
so when we talk about the sequences we
 

161
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,510
so when we talk about the sequences we
talk about why is the v

162
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:41,520
talk about why is the v
 

163
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,590
talk about why is the v
naught p v is the value current value

164
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:45,600
naught p v is the value current value
 

165
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,909
naught p v is the value current value
or maybe how do you represent this note

166
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:47,919
or maybe how do you represent this note
 

167
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,909
or maybe how do you represent this note
so basically look this is post order

168
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:49,919
so basically look this is post order
 

169
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,350
so basically look this is post order
first order is

170
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:51,360
first order is
 

171
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,390
first order is
the left left tree left notes

00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:54,400
the left left tree left notes
 

173
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,150
the left left tree left notes
right now the current note okay yeah

174
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:58,160
right now the current note okay yeah
 

175
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,469
right now the current note okay yeah
yeah so remind me if it's a binary

176
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:00,479
yeah so remind me if it's a binary
 

177
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:01,590
yeah so remind me if it's a binary
search tree

178
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:01,600
search tree
 

179
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,469
search tree
and which order gives a sorted list if

180
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:04,479
and which order gives a sorted list if
 

181
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:05,990
and which order gives a sorted list if
it's final research tree

182
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:06,000
it's final research tree
 

183
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:16,710
it's final research tree
which order makes it a sorted list

184
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:16,720

 

185
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,230

for binary search tree there is no oh

186
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:20,240
for binary search tree there is no oh
 

187
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,310
for binary search tree there is no oh
there's another one the uh yeah

188
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:24,320
there's another one the uh yeah
 

189
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,350
there's another one the uh yeah
it's actually this one in order yeah

190
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:27,360
it's actually this one in order yeah
 

191
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,790
it's actually this one in order yeah
all right look one

192
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:30,800
all right look one
 

193
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,629
all right look one
zero minus one

194
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:34,639
zero minus one
 

195
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,550
zero minus one
zero point five two

196
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:38,560
zero point five two
 

197
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,170
zero point five two
three so this in order will be

198
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:40,180

00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:50,400
one two three okay yeah
 

205
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,230
one two three okay yeah
okay so that's in order yeah because

206
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:52,240
okay so that's in order yeah because
 

207
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,469
okay so that's in order yeah because
this is you know so in order of a binary

208
00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:54,479
this is you know so in order of a binary
 

209
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,590
this is you know so in order of a binary
search tree

210
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:55,600
search tree
 

211
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,189
search tree
is a sorted list right yeah

212
00:05:59,189 --> 00:05:59,199
is a sorted list right yeah
 

213
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,350
is a sorted list right yeah
there's another one called reverse in

214
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:01,360
there's another one called reverse in
 

215
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,270
there's another one called reverse in
order so what's reversing order

216
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:03,280
order so what's reversing order
 

217
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,900
order so what's reversing order
yeah we

218
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:08,910

okay yeah don't talk too much about this

226
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:18,639
okay yeah don't talk too much about this
 

227
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:19,909
okay yeah don't talk too much about this
let's talk about it yeah

228
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:19,919
let's talk about it yeah
 

229
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,430
let's talk about it yeah
yeah so it's been so

230
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:23,440
yeah so it's been so
 

231
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,710
yeah so it's been so
six minutes and a half so let's the

232
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:26,720
six minutes and a half so let's the
 

233
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,710
six minutes and a half so let's the
how can we solve this problem one

234
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:28,720
how can we solve this problem one
 

235
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,870
how can we solve this problem one
solution is that we visit the notes

236
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:30,880
solution is that we visit the notes
 

237
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,110
solution is that we visit the notes
with the tree yeah using the different

238
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:33,120
with the tree yeah using the different
 

239
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,390
with the tree yeah using the different
search okay

240
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:34,400
search okay
 

241
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,590
search okay
and if we meet the loot uh

242
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:37,600
and if we meet the loot uh
 

243
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,710
and if we meet the loot uh
the leaf which has no children we

244
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:40,720
the leaf which has no children we
 

245
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,350
the leaf which has no children we
put the depth we put its current depth

246
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:43,360
put the depth we put its current depth
 

247
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:43,990
put the depth we put its current depth
into

248
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:44,000
into
 

249
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,350
into
d on it yeah on a set another set yeah

250
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:47,360
d on it yeah on a set another set yeah
 

251
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,390
d on it yeah on a set another set yeah
and then if all the leaves on the

252
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:50,400
and then if all the leaves on the
 

253
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,270
and then if all the leaves on the
of the panel 3 is the same level what

254
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:53,280
of the panel 3 is the same level what
 

255
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,710
of the panel 3 is the same level what
does it mean

256
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:54,720
does it mean
 

257
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,270
does it mean
it means that how many elements are in a

258
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:57,280
it means that how many elements are in a
 

259
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,150
it means that how many elements are in a
set

260

set
 

261
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,909

if they are all in the same level so how

262
00:06:59,909 --> 00:06:59,919
if they are all in the same level so how
 

263
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,430
if they are all in the same level so how
many how many numbers in a set

how many levels how many kind of levels
 

271
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,550
how many levels how many kind of levels
do we have less and less

272
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:14,560
do we have less and less
 

273
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,350
do we have less and less
two for the leaves from the leaves oh

274
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:17,360
two for the leaves from the leaves oh

what it's a set so i put a set
 

297
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,589
what it's a set so i put a set
i put a i put a leaves levels in the set

298
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:47,599
i put a i put a leaves levels in the set
 

299
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,869
i put a i put a leaves levels in the set
so how many elements in a set

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,590
the algorithm is like
if we i travel a tree and if this is a

338
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:47,600
if we i travel a tree and if this is a
 

339
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,269
if we i travel a tree and if this is a
leaf node yeah i put its depth which is

340
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:51,279
leaf node yeah i put its depth which is
 

341
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,550
leaf node yeah i put its depth which is
two here

342
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:52,560
two here
 

343
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,670
two here
a set yeah and then i go to here

344
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:55,680
a set yeah and then i go to here
 

345
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,230
a set yeah and then i go to here
and it will be the same i put a two here

346
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:58,240
and it will be the same i put a two here
 

347
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,990
and it will be the same i put a two here
yeah my set doesn't

348
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:00,000
yeah my set doesn't
 

349
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,430
yeah my set doesn't
accept me a set does not store

350
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:03,440
accept me a set does not store
 

351
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,550
accept me a set does not store
duplicate an event do you get it

352
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:06,560
duplicate an event do you get it
 

353
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,750
duplicate an event do you get it
yeah so if i said look if this d equals

354
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:09,760
yeah so if i said look if this d equals
 

355
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,030
yeah so if i said look if this d equals
z alright

356
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,040
z alright
 

357
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,070
z alright
and then look d dot at

358
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:14,080
and then look d dot at
 

359
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,030
and then look d dot at
two and then d will be here right look

360
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:17,040
two and then d will be here right look
 

361
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,389
two and then d will be here right look
if i add one more time

362
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:18,399
if i add one more time
 

363
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,829
if i add one more time
d dot a two what do you think will

364
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:21,839
d dot a two what do you think will
 

365
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:26,630
d dot a two what do you think will
happen

366
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:26,640

 

367
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,630

a set what do what do you think will

368
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:28,640
a set what do what do you think will
 

369
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,670
a set what do what do you think will
happen d dot

370
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:29,680
happen d dot
 

371
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,870
happen d dot
set is theta set is this one at two i

372
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:32,880
set is theta set is this one at two i
 

373
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,030
set is theta set is this one at two i
put a two and add another two what will

374
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,040
put a two and add another two what will
 

375
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,509
put a two and add another two what will
happen if you said what did i just say i

376
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:37,519
happen if you said what did i just say i
 

377
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,790
happen if you said what did i just say i
said a set does not

378
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:38,800
said a set does not
 

379
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,310
said a set does not
store duplicate elements so what

380
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:42,320
store duplicate elements so what
 

381
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,350
store duplicate elements so what
will happen uh

382
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:45,360
will happen uh
 

383
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,190
will happen uh
nothing will happen right because we

384
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:47,200
nothing will happen right because we
 

385
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,269
nothing will happen right because we
already have two yeah that's what i mean

386
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:49,279
already have two yeah that's what i mean
 

387
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,350
already have two yeah that's what i mean
so you put another you need another leaf

388
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:51,360
so you put another you need another leaf
 

389
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,470
so you put another you need another leaf
note i put a

390
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:52,480
note i put a
 

391
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,790
note i put a
step which is two and another note which

392
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:54,800
step which is two and another note which
 

393
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,509
step which is two and another note which
is two

394
00:09:55,509 --> 00:09:55,519
is two
 

395
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,710
is two
so if all the leaves knows are on the

396
00:09:58,710 --> 00:09:58,720
so if all the leaves knows are on the
 

397
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,430
so if all the leaves knows are on the
same level

398
00:09:59,430 --> 00:09:59,440
same level
 

399
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,590
same level
so how many elements should this set

400
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:01,600
so how many elements should this set
 

401
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,350
so how many elements should this set
have

402
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:03,360
have
 

403
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,670
have
one yeah that's it i was looking for

404
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:05,680
one yeah that's it i was looking for
 

405
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,190
one yeah that's it i was looking for
this answer for a long time we're gonna

406
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:07,200
this answer for a long time we're gonna
 

407
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:07,670
this answer for a long time we're gonna
just say

408
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:07,680
just say
 

409
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,310
just say
one did you get it now yeah yeah did you

410
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:10,320
one did you get it now yeah yeah did you
 

411
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:10,949
one did you get it now yeah yeah did you
get it

412
00:10:10,949 --> 00:10:10,959
get it
 

413
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,870
get it
okay boom

414
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:14,880
okay boom
 

415
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:29,350
okay boom
okay now we do the fifth step search

416
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:29,360

 

417
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,230

and then they call them yeah dude is the

418
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:32,240
and then they call them yeah dude is the
 

419
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,190
and then they call them yeah dude is the
loot okay

420
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:33,200
loot okay
 

421
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,790
loot okay
and look we can we can have

422
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:36,800
and look we can we can have
 

423
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,110
and look we can we can have
another death inside of that yeah this

424
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:39,120
another death inside of that yeah this
 

425
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,150
another death inside of that yeah this
is new right

426
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:40,160
is new right
 

427
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,910
is new right
yes yeah so look i can have this

428
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:43,920
yes yeah so look i can have this
 

429
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,990
yes yeah so look i can have this
death here this is a local function

430
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:48,000
death here this is a local function
 

431
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,670
death here this is a local function
yeah local function so i use it dfs

432
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:51,680
yeah local function so i use it dfs
 

433
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,949
yeah local function so i use it dfs
right dfs

434
00:10:54,949 --> 00:10:54,959
right dfs
 

435
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,389
right dfs
okay and then here i load

436
00:10:58,389 --> 00:10:58,399
okay and then here i load
 

437
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,790
okay and then here i load
and then i need to pass current steps

438
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:00,800
and then i need to pass current steps
 

439
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,550
and then i need to pass current steps
yes current depth i put a current

440
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:02,560
yes current depth i put a current
 

441
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,829
yes current depth i put a current
current this okay

442
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:03,839
current this okay
 

443
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,829
current this okay
what's what's missing here okay

444
00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:07,839
what's what's missing here okay
 

445
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,350
what's what's missing here okay
if loot is num

446
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:11,360
if loot is num
 

447
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,069
if loot is num
okay then we return nothing right return

448
00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:14,079
okay then we return nothing right return
 

449
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,910
okay then we return nothing right return
just return

450
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:15,920
just return
 

451
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,750
just return
how do you check if it's a leaf node

452
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:19,760

 

453
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,470

how do you check if it's if not if it

454
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:22,480
how do you check if it's if not if it
 

455
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,190
how do you check if it's if not if it
doesn't have

456
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:23,200
doesn't have
 

457
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,350
doesn't have
any child okay so how to invert it if

458
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:25,360
any child okay so how to invert it if
 

459
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:41,030
any child okay so how to invert it if
loot left

460
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:41,040

 

461
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,150

are you okay

462
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:44,160

 

463
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,550

i know look we have a we put a depth

464
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:46,560
i know look we have a we put a depth
 

465
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,069
i know look we have a we put a depth
here okay remember this d

466
00:11:48,069 --> 00:11:48,079
here okay remember this d
 

467
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,460
here okay remember this d
equals set yeah this is set okay

468
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:50,470
equals set yeah this is set okay
 

469
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:51,590
equals set yeah this is set okay
[Music]

470
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:51,600
[Music]
 

471
00:11:51,600 --> 00:12:09,110
[Music]
and then if it's if it's a leaf node

472
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:09,120

 

473
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,190

because if no i don't i don't need to

474
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:11,200
because if no i don't i don't need to
 

475
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,790
because if no i don't i don't need to
travel there are no more children i can

476
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:12,800
travel there are no more children i can
 

477
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,150
travel there are no more children i can
just return yeah

478
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:14,160
just return yeah
 

479
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,509
just return yeah
right now look if we loot it's not

480
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:17,519
right now look if we loot it's not
 

481
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,190
right now look if we loot it's not
not leave no then dfs

482
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:21,200
not leave no then dfs
 

483
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,230
not leave no then dfs
blue dot left yeah

484
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:24,240
blue dot left yeah
 

485
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,350
blue dot left yeah
trevor is left left what should i put

486
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:27,360
trevor is left left what should i put
 

487
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,470
trevor is left left what should i put
here

488
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:28,480
here
 

489
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,430
here
current add one wow how do you know yeah

490
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:31,440
current add one wow how do you know yeah
 

491
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:31,990
current add one wow how do you know yeah
because

492
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:32,000
because
 

493
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,590
because
yes no this is not current yeah and then

494
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:35,600
yes no this is not current yeah and then
 

495
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,069
yes no this is not current yeah and then
it's the

496
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:36,079
it's the
 

497
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,389
it's the
next note will be current plus one yeah

498
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:38,399
next note will be current plus one yeah
 

499
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,269
next note will be current plus one yeah
why yeah

500
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:39,279
why yeah
 

501
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,269
why yeah
you get it okay and what will happen

502
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:41,279
you get it okay and what will happen
 

503
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,949
you get it okay and what will happen
here we need to travel the right

504
00:12:42,949 --> 00:12:42,959
here we need to travel the right
 

505
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:47,110
here we need to travel the right
right tree right yeah dfs read the right

506
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:47,120
right tree right yeah dfs read the right
 

507
00:12:47,120 --> 00:13:02,150
right tree right yeah dfs read the right
current minus one minus one

508
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:02,160

 

509
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,590

and what should i put at the beginning

510
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:03,600
and what should i put at the beginning
 

511
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:19,269
and what should i put at the beginning
here

512
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:19,279

 

513
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,310

yes yeah okay so what after this

514
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:22,320
yes yeah okay so what after this
 

515
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,030
yes yeah okay so what after this
the d should contain all the numbers of

516
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:25,040
the d should contain all the numbers of
 

517
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,829
the d should contain all the numbers of
the depths

518
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:25,839
the depths
 

519
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:32,230
the depths
of the leaf notes

520
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:32,240

 

521
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,030

we need to check the room now what what

522
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:35,040
we need to check the room now what what
 

523
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,310
we need to check the room now what what
what do we need to check

524
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:36,320
what do we need to check
 

525
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,829
what do we need to check
i was teaching a cup return

526
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:39,839
i was teaching a cup return
 

527
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,670
i was teaching a cup return
how many numbers are in the d three

528
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:43,680
how many numbers are in the d three
 

529
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,509
how many numbers are in the d three
how many numbers remember i was talking

530
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:45,519
how many numbers remember i was talking
 

531
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:46,790
how many numbers remember i was talking
about the

532
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:46,800
about the
 

533
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,990
about the
thing how many different numbers of the

534
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:50,000
thing how many different numbers of the
 

535
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,110
thing how many different numbers of the
yes or how do we do it return what

536
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:53,120
yes or how do we do it return what
 

537
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,710
yes or how do we do it return what
reason one come on then

538
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:56,720
reason one come on then
 

539
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,829
reason one come on then
plants yeah plants was b and

540
00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:00,839
plants yeah plants was b and
 

541
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,069
plants yeah plants was b and
what we want to check the lens if it's

542
00:14:04,069 --> 00:14:04,079
what we want to check the lens if it's
 

543
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:04,949
what we want to check the lens if it's
equal to one

544
00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:04,959
equal to one
 

545
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,470
equal to one
so how do we write it

546
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:07,480
so how do we write it
 

547
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:11,509
so how do we write it

549
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,949
[Music]
equal equal one come on why

550
00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:14,959
equal equal one come on why
 

551
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,870
equal equal one come on why
oh yeah is that is that enough yeah

552
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:18,880
oh yeah is that is that enough yeah
 

553
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,990
oh yeah is that is that enough yeah
yeah yeah okay so

554
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:22,000
yeah yeah okay so
 

555
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,150
yeah yeah okay so
term complexity out time complexity

556
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:26,160
term complexity out time complexity
 

557
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:34,710
term complexity out time complexity
oh i i i i i

558
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:34,720

 

559
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,949

what's the space complexity

560
00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:38,959

 

561
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,110

are there any additional space we need

562
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:41,120
are there any additional space we need
 

563
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,670
are there any additional space we need
to use

564
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:43,680

 

565
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,030

what's this is this a space set yeah

566
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:47,040
what's this is this a space set yeah
 

567
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,990
what's this is this a space set yeah
yeah so what's the complexity one no no

568
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:50,000
yeah so what's the complexity one no no
 

569
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,710
yeah so what's the complexity one no no
no no no

570
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:50,720
no no no
 

571
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:56,870
no no no
no no no no we are using what it says

572
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:56,880

 

573
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:03,430

no

574
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:03,440

 

575
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,230

this way look yeah it contains all the

576
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:06,240
this way look yeah it contains all the
 

577
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,910
this way look yeah it contains all the
notes different levels

578
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:09,920

 

579
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,110

actually is it a one could be a one or

580
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:13,120
actually is it a one could be a one or
 

581
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,310
actually is it a one could be a one or
no maybe maybe look

582
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:14,320
no maybe maybe look
 

583
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,910
no maybe maybe look
yeah look now look this kind of tree

584
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:17,920
yeah look now look this kind of tree
 

585
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,870
yeah look now look this kind of tree
look

586
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:18,880
look
 

587
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,310
look
yeah so these notes

588
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:22,320
yeah so these notes
 

589
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,230
yeah so these notes
can be on different levels yeah

590
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:26,240
can be on different levels yeah
 

591
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,710
can be on different levels yeah
yeah this kind of tree so if there are

592
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:28,720
yeah this kind of tree so if there are
 

593
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,910
yeah this kind of tree so if there are
ends and nose

594
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:29,920
ends and nose
 

595
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,629
ends and nose
and properly some lines stretching out

596
00:15:32,629 --> 00:15:32,639
and properly some lines stretching out
 

597
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,870
and properly some lines stretching out
yeah yeah i'm just talking about that uh

598
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:34,880
yeah yeah i'm just talking about that uh
 

599
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,629
yeah yeah i'm just talking about that uh
look if there are enough of the

600
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:38,639
look if there are enough of the
 

601
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,350
look if there are enough of the
look how many how many notes are there

602
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:41,360
look how many how many notes are there
 

603
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,590
look how many how many notes are there
one two three four five six seven eight

604
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:43,600
one two three four five six seven eight
 

605
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,470
one two three four five six seven eight
nine

606
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:44,480
nine
 

607
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,110
nine
nine notes and there are four one two

608
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:47,120
nine notes and there are four one two
 

609
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,710
nine notes and there are four one two
three four five

610
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:48,720
three four five
 

611
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,269
three four five
five different levels of these notes so

612
00:15:51,269 --> 00:15:51,279
five different levels of these notes so
 

613
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:51,749
five different levels of these notes so
if we

614
00:15:51,749 --> 00:15:51,759
if we
 

615
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:57,430
if we
n minus divided by two plus one

616
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:57,440
n minus divided by two plus one
 

617
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,590
n minus divided by two plus one
yeah so it's o n right do you get it

618
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:01,600
yeah so it's o n right do you get it
 

619
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,030
yeah so it's o n right do you get it
oh n because in the worst case

620
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:05,040
oh n because in the worst case
 

621
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,069
oh n because in the worst case
this kind of tree yeah you need

622
00:16:08,069 --> 00:16:08,079
this kind of tree yeah you need
 

623
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,670
this kind of tree yeah you need
at least on space to

624
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:11,680
at least on space to
 

625
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,189
at least on space to
to keep the different numbers of

626
00:16:15,189 --> 00:16:15,199
to keep the different numbers of
 

627
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,629
to keep the different numbers of
representing the level of the leaf nodes

628
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:18,639
representing the level of the leaf nodes
 

629
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,990
representing the level of the leaf nodes
right yeah okay okay so

630
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:22,000
right yeah okay okay so
 

631
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,389
right yeah okay okay so
everyone do you want to do the quiz i

632
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:24,399
everyone do you want to do the quiz i
 

633
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:25,430
everyone do you want to do the quiz i
erase some of it

634
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:25,440
erase some of it
 

635
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,790
