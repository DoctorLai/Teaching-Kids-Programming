no no no target is ten so you want to
 

31
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:47,590
no no no target is ten so you want to
find the triplets

32
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:47,600
find the triplets
 

33
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,110
find the triplets
three periods and one add it together

34
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:51,120
three periods and one add it together
 

35
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,590
three periods and one add it together
smaller than ten okay

36
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:53,600
smaller than ten okay
 

37
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,310
smaller than ten okay
two four one okay that's one and then

many of them so that's one right

44
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:02,559
many of them so that's one right
 

45
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,870
many of them so that's one right
okay can you find anything less than ten

46
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:06,880

let's find a 12 okay okay
 

53
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,710
let's find a 12 okay okay
that'll be two fourths two four six

54
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:18,720
that'll be two fourths two four six
 

55
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,149
that'll be two fourths two four six
oh no no no no thirteen thirteen let's

56
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:20,159
oh no no no no thirteen thirteen let's
 

57
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,390
oh no no no no thirteen thirteen let's
say

58
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:22,400

 

59
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,510

two four six ten four one

60
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:25,520
two four six ten four one
 

61
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,550
two four six ten four one
so we have already got this okay two

62
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:28,560
so we have already got this okay two

eight twenty a one two right
 

71
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,310
eight twenty a one two right
okay or two one a yeah it doesn't matter

72
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:42,320
okay or two one a yeah it doesn't matter
 

73
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,069
okay or two one a yeah it doesn't matter
okay as long as it's three

74
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:44,079
okay as long as it's three
 

75
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,270
okay as long as it's three
yeah these numbers are unique okay okay

76
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:47,280
yeah these numbers are unique okay okay
 

77
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,590
yeah these numbers are unique okay okay
so how many pairs one two three four

78
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:49,600
so how many pairs one two three four
 

79
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,870
so how many pairs one two three four
five five so you need to

80
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:50,880
five five so you need to
 

81
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,910
five five so you need to
tell me five is that oh i don't know

82
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:53,920
tell me five is that oh i don't know
 

83
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,830
tell me five is that oh i don't know
suppose is for all right

84
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:55,840
suppose is for all right
 

85
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,149
suppose is for all right
does it make sense or seven

86
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:00,159
does it make sense or seven
 

87
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,109
does it make sense or seven
no no this is too big seven four one

88
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:03,119
no no this is too big seven four one
 

89
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:20,790

91
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,910

less than 30. okay so one two three four

92
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:23,920
less than 30. okay so one two three four
 

93
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,190
less than 30. okay so one two three four
five six seven seven right

five six seven seven right
 

95
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,030
five six seven seven right
okay okay so basically we want to find

96
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,040
okay okay so basically we want to find
 

97
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,309
okay okay so basically we want to find
the number of

98
00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:32,319
the number of
 

99
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,710
the number of
triplets the sum of lambda triplets

100
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:34,720
triplets the sum of lambda triplets
 

101
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,750
triplets the sum of lambda triplets
strictly

102
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:35,760
strictly
 

103
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,830
strictly
smaller than the target and we want to

104
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:37,840
smaller than the target and we want to
 

105
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,270
smaller than the target and we want to
count how many of them

106
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:39,280
count how many of them
 

107
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,309
count how many of them
one nine three okay one nine two one so

108
00:02:42,309 --> 00:02:42,319
one nine three okay one nine two one so
 

109
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,350
one nine three okay one nine two one so
any idea how we do this to this

110
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:45,360
any idea how we do this to this
 

111
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,309
any idea how we do this to this
performance where are the proof versions

performance where are the proof versions
 

113
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,750
performance where are the proof versions
so what's the true housing

114
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:49,760
so what's the true housing
 

115
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:59,350

00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:15,840
i'll show you how to how do we do this
 

173
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,150
i'll show you how to how do we do this
okay and now you can tell me okay

174
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:18,160
okay and now you can tell me okay
 

175
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,990
okay and now you can tell me okay
let's first of all solve this number

176
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:22,000

 

177
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,270

four five seven nine

178
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:25,280
four five seven nine
 

179
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,270
four five seven nine
ten okay let's just try this and if we

180
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:27,280
ten okay let's just try this and if we
 

181
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,550
ten okay let's just try this and if we
only pick three numbers

182
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:28,560
only pick three numbers
 

183
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,909
only pick three numbers
less than 20

184
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:31,919
less than 20
 

185
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,350
less than 20
okay that would be a lot okay

186
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:35,360
okay that would be a lot okay
 

187
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,870
okay that would be a lot okay
that'll be easy okay so let's

188
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:38,880
that'll be easy okay so let's
 

189
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,950
that'll be easy okay so let's
let's first of all it would be like

190
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:40,960
let's first of all it would be like
 

191
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,469
let's first of all it would be like
similar like three times for some

192
00:05:42,469 --> 00:05:42,479
similar like three times for some
 

193
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,310
similar like three times for some
problem first of all we fixed the

194
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:44,320
problem first of all we fixed the
 

195
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,189
problem first of all we fixed the
two numbers which is we improve forcing

196
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:47,199
two numbers which is we improve forcing
 

197
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,790
two numbers which is we improve forcing
these two numbers first number

198
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:48,800
these two numbers first number
 

199
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:57,350
these two numbers first number
and the second number okay right

200
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:57,360

 

201
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,189

the left this is the right okay

202
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:01,199

 

203
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,510

the first number the second number why

204
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:03,520
the first number the second number why
 

205
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,510
the first number the second number why
don't we have four pointers

206
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:05,520
don't we have four pointers
 

207
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,150
don't we have four pointers
no we if we fix two numbers we already

208
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,160
no we if we fix two numbers we already
 

209
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,909
no we if we fix two numbers we already
picked these two numbers and then we we

210
00:06:09,909 --> 00:06:09,919
picked these two numbers and then we we
 

211
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,469
picked these two numbers and then we we
have

212
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:10,479
have
 

213
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,590
have
we want to apply have two of them

214
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:13,600
we want to apply have two of them
 

215
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,629
we want to apply have two of them
we uh

216
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:16,639
we uh
 

217
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,430
we uh
any of these to

218
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:21,440

 

219
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,749

my mistake my mistake i'm confused okay

220
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:23,759
my mistake my mistake i'm confused okay
 

221
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:24,790
my mistake my mistake i'm confused okay
so

222
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:24,800
so
 

223
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,189
so
first of all we pick the first number

224
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:27,199
first of all we pick the first number
 

225
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,390
first of all we pick the first number
all right look

226
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:28,400
all right look
 

227
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,150
all right look
pick the first number right and now

228
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:32,160
pick the first number right and now
 

229
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,510
pick the first number right and now
for this match i want to pick two

230
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:33,520
for this match i want to pick two
 

231
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,909
for this match i want to pick two
numbers here right and then this is the

232
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:35,919
numbers here right and then this is the
 

233
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:36,710
numbers here right and then this is the
left this is

234
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:36,720
left this is
 

235
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,990
left this is
right okay okay what what's what's the

236
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:40,000
right okay okay what what's what's the
 

237
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,909
right okay okay what what's what's the
one plus two plus nine oh twelve

238
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:43,919
one plus two plus nine oh twelve
 

239
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,830
one plus two plus nine oh twelve
twelve right it's it's smaller than

240
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:45,840
twelve right it's it's smaller than
 

241
00:06:45,840 --> 00:07:00,950
twelve right it's it's smaller than
twenty right yeah

242
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:00,960

 

243
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,710

what the first number is one i already

244
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:02,720
what the first number is one i already
 

245
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,550
what the first number is one i already
fixed i approve of this and the second

246
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:04,560
fixed i approve of this and the second
 

247
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,469
fixed i approve of this and the second
number and the third number

248
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:06,479
number and the third number
 

249
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,830
number and the third number
right yeah and now look we know 12 is

250
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:09,840
right yeah and now look we know 12 is
 

251
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,270
right yeah and now look we know 12 is
stricter than 20 right so

252
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:13,280
stricter than 20 right so
 

253
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,909
stricter than 20 right so
now if i move this right pointer to the

254
00:07:15,909 --> 00:07:15,919
now if i move this right pointer to the
 

255
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:16,870
now if i move this right pointer to the
left

256
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:16,880
left
 

257
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,350
left
does it still satisfy less than oh yeah

258
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:19,360
does it still satisfy less than oh yeah
 

259
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,230
does it still satisfy less than oh yeah
yeah

260
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:20,240
yeah
 

261
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,189
yeah
i move it moving more so how many of

262
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:23,199
i move it moving more so how many of
 

263
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,390
i move it moving more so how many of
them i need to add

264
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:26,400

 

265
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,670

four five yep and left

266
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:29,680
four five yep and left
 

267
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,110
four five yep and left
is left raises one two eyes index

268
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:33,120
is left raises one two eyes index
 

269
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,230
is left raises one two eyes index
zero one two three four five six i is

270
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:36,240
zero one two three four five six i is
 

271
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,830
zero one two three four five six i is
index six

272
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:37,840
index six
 

273
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,029
index six
i is index six left index

274
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:41,039
i is index six left index
 

275
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,390
i is index six left index
one so how many pairs are there if left

276
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:44,400
one so how many pairs are there if left
 

277
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,629
one so how many pairs are there if left
if the first number plus the numbers at

278
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:46,639
if the first number plus the numbers at
 

279
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,510
if the first number plus the numbers at
air the plus

280
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:47,520
air the plus
 

281
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,029
air the plus
numbers at r is strictly smaller than 20

282
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:51,039
numbers at r is strictly smaller than 20
 

283
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,950
numbers at r is strictly smaller than 20
so we how many numbers we can we add

284
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:54,960
so we how many numbers we can we add
 

285
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,309
so we how many numbers we can we add
how many how many two plates so we can

286
00:07:58,309 --> 00:07:58,319
how many how many two plates so we can
 

287
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,510
how many how many two plates so we can
have one two four

288
00:07:59,510 --> 00:07:59,520
have one two four
 

289
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,309
have one two four
one two five one two seven one two eight

290
00:08:02,309 --> 00:08:02,319
one two five one two seven one two eight
 

291
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,710
one two five one two seven one two eight
one two nine how many of them

292
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:04,720
one two nine how many of them
 

293
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,270
one two nine how many of them
uh how many of them

294
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:09,280
uh how many of them
 

295
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,869
uh how many of them
five yeah and which is r

296
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:12,879
five yeah and which is r
 

297
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,550
five yeah and which is r
minus l yeah where that right got it

298
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:16,560
minus l yeah where that right got it
 

299
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,550
minus l yeah where that right got it
yeah this is the interesting part is the

300
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:18,560
yeah this is the interesting part is the
 

301
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,790
yeah this is the interesting part is the
middle because look we already know

302
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:20,800
middle because look we already know
 

303
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,350
middle because look we already know
these three numbers added together

304
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:23,360
these three numbers added together
 

305
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,869
these three numbers added together
smaller than target

306
00:08:24,869 --> 00:08:24,879
smaller than target
 

307
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,029
smaller than target
and at this point if i keep moving the

308
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:27,039
and at this point if i keep moving the
 

309
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:27,990
and at this point if i keep moving the
right to the left

310
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:28,000
right to the left
 

311
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,469
right to the left
i still smaller right because it's salty

312
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:30,479
i still smaller right because it's salty
 

313
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:31,189
i still smaller right because it's salty
right

314
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:31,199
right
 

315
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,630
right
yeah this makes sense how come um

316
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:34,640
yeah this makes sense how come um
 

317
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,190
yeah this makes sense how come um
oh yeah yeah because it's smaller right

318
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:37,200
oh yeah yeah because it's smaller right
 

319
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:37,990
oh yeah yeah because it's smaller right
but look

320
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:38,000
but look
 

321
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,350
but look
if the target is what if like the target

322
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:41,360
if the target is what if like the target
 

323
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,949
if the target is what if like the target
is less than one two is eleven okay

324
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:44,959
is less than one two is eleven okay
 

325
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,150
is less than one two is eleven okay
right then if this target is eleven it's

326
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:48,160
right then if this target is eleven it's
 

327
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:48,710
right then if this target is eleven it's
eleven

328
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:48,720
eleven
 

329
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,190
eleven
twelve is bigger than eleven right so we

330
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:51,200
twelve is bigger than eleven right so we
 

331
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,630
twelve is bigger than eleven right so we
can't move it we want to

332
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:52,640
can't move it we want to
 

333
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,910
can't move it we want to
move the one

334
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:55,920

 

335
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,630

this one

336
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:00,640

 

337
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,150

is bigger than 11. so you mean right
 

345
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,590
is bigger than 11. so you mean right
to the right left yes okay okay

346
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:17,600
to the right left yes okay okay
 

347
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,590
to the right left yes okay okay
yeah and look before before is 20

348
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:21,600
yeah and look before before is 20
 

349
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,630
yeah and look before before is 20
so when it's 20 we we we add it and we

350
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:24,640
so when it's 20 we we we add it and we
 

351
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,670
so when it's 20 we we we add it and we
we want to move the left or right we

352
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:27,680
we want to move the left or right we

well there's no i thought okay
 

419
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,110
well there's no i thought okay
okay k minus j and then what should we

420
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:29,120
okay k minus j and then what should we
 

421
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,870
okay k minus j and then what should we
do with the pointers we should move the

422
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:30,880
do with the pointers we should move the
 

423
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,990
do with the pointers we should move the
left or right

424
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:34,000

 

425
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,269

we should move the left which is j plus

426
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:37,279
we should move the left which is j plus
 

427
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,550
we should move the left which is j plus
equal one one

equal one one
 

429
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:46,470
equal one one
okay so what should we do

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,590

00:11:51,600 --> 00:12:08,949

n squared because this is o and log n
 

437
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,150
n squared because this is o and log n
but this is more than

00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:12,160
but this is more than
 

439
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,470
but this is more than
o n square this is the first loop this

440
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:14,480
o n square this is the first loop this
 

441
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,790
o n square this is the first loop this
is the second loop right left and time

442
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:16,800
is the second loop right left and time
 

443
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,310

that's the first time yeah what's expect
