1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,000
hello

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:06,240
hello mr mr ryan hi are you right yes

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,559
okay so we today we're going to

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,880
talk about making a simple game yeah

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:14,880
which is called the apple catching yeah

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:17,920
so just imagine this we have a

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:21,199
screen little screen with 25 pixels yeah

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,960
25 pixels somehow this is not showing

9
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,359
uh

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,680
let's just refresh this a little bit so

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,800
we have these

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:33,680
25 pixels 25 pixels and we we're going

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,960
to make a game that has the random app

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,760
falling from

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,680
the

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,360
top to the bottom and then we have a

17
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,760
little piece

18
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,719
at the bottom to catch it yeah when we

19
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,520
catch it

20
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,559
the score will be incremented and if the

21
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,559
apple

22
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,039
falls down to the

23
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,960
bottom then the game is over yeah the

24
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,680
simple logic is there okay

25
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,800
so

26
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,520
first of all

27
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,559
in order to do this just recall last uh

28
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,480
lesson we we we have a running picture

29
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:05,119
yeah from left to right from top to

30
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:08,000
bottom and what we did is to

31
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:10,720
uh plot it yeah we have a plot

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,880
zero zero for example that would plot a

33
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:17,439
pixel in the first

34
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:19,280
top left right so we we basically wait

35
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,600
delay or

36
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,840
basic the

37
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,880
uh pause yeah there's a function called

38
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,040
pause pause 100 a thousand means a

39
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,240
second yeah a thousand

40
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:35,040
and then we unplot it

41
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,759
and plot it and then

42
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,799
when we unplot it then we need to

43
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:43,200
plot the second pixel uh the next pixel

44
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,880
yeah so basically if you you've combined

45
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,000
all these commands you will pro first

46
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,479
one yeah

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,640
yeah delayed a thousand i don't know

48
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,560
it's i think a thousand a second yeah

49
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,720
and unplug the first one and then plot

50
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,280
the next pixel so that that will give us

51
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,200
that kind of this animation right so the

52
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,280
animation is basically like you draw

53
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,520
something on one pixel

54
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,360
you wait a second

55
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,200
yeah wait a few seconds interval and

56
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,920
then you erase it

57
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,000
yeah and then you move to the next pixel

58
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,080
to to draw it and it looks like an

59
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,480
animation but this is too much

60
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,760
too much work yeah we can use the

61
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,560
uh

62
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,280
uh

63
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,959
have a useful thing in micro b which is

64
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,520
called spy sprite okay so we can say

65
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:31,040
uh you know pixel dot

66
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:33,680
again dot create sprite so let's say

67
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,680
so we create a sprite at x equals zero y

68
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,360
equals zero so that will give us a pixel

69
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,560
on the top left

70
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,640
yeah now we can ask it to move

71
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,120
move one pixel to the right by default

72
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,200
the direction is to the right so if

73
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,599
you see it moves to right here

74
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,239
and we can ask it to move again

75
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,680
now you move two pixels yeah got it

76
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,680
yeah so look

77
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,879
i i just have two

78
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,640
two so i don't need to erase it

79
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,840
i don't need to erase it instead i just

80
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:06,720
asked it to move so look this sprite is

81
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:10,080
kind of that object right it's like a

82
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,040
a thing that you know pig pizza is is

83
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,159
very

84
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,440
uh

85
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:18,000
it's not really associated with any

86
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,720
object right because pixel is there you

87
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,680
can draw you can erase it but this pixel

88
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,400
is like a sprite it's like an object so

89
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:29,040
it has something it's an object right

90
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,599
you can ask it to move and then

91
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,680
yeah different viewpoint yeah so look if

92
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,760
we have this picture we can have

93
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,760
different you know delete yeah obviously

94
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,920
we delete it then you'll be gone right

95
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,920
if we didn't go yeah did it

96
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,480
what else do we have it's deleted check

97
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,319
if did it move 10 right so it has

98
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,440
direction you can ask it to turn level

99
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,680
right yeah

100
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,920
change set get is touching okay this is

101
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,439
very useful so we can do some this

102
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,720
very useful

103
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,519
um

104
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,840
collision detection so we can check if

105
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,599
the pixel is touching the edge yeah if

106
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,920
it's touching the edge the edge is the

107
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,920
boundary yeah boundary here

108
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,159
or it's touching another pixel so this

109
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,720
is we're going to use this touching so

110
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,360
we have a picture like apple and we have

111
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,799
another pixel is

112
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,040
yeah yeah you you can say you and then

113
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,359
we can say if it's touching if it starts

114
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,040
it means that we have successfully catch

115
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,280
the iphone right

116
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,560
yeah okay

117
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,160
yeah look at it

118
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,600
yeah look at lots of function and

119
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,759
there's a few functions we're going to

120
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,759
use which is change y by

121
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,759
by one we can just say change y by one

122
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,759
oh we can set the directions to falling

123
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,720
down and then we can move right so it's

124
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:41,120
the same set brightly yeah how how dark

125
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,800
or bright say directions x right turn

126
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,639
left and right yeah we're going to use

127
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,720
this turn left and right when we descend

128
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,479
a snake again you know when we have a

129
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,880
snake we can ask it to turn left and

130
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:53,600
right yeah but for today just the change

131
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,840
y will be sufficient yeah change will be

132
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,680
sufficient so so normally we would

133
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,160
define the game using the object

134
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,400
oriented objective like you know class

135
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,520
like game we want to do this

136
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,080
okay

137
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,840
and we define this init function

138
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,479
constructor yeah

139
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,320
yeah but unfortunately it

140
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:15,600
in micro bit it doesn't support these

141
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,720
kind of complex syntax so so we just do

142
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,880
it by

143
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,120
declaring the variables on you know

144
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:24,160
beforehand and listed everything left so

145
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,080
first of all we need to have these the

146
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,919
apple right so apple

147
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,840
yeah we define the apple

148
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,560
but the apple

149
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,280
we

150
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,759
uh first we want it to be

151
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,520
random position and random position one

152
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,919
two three four five but on the first row

153
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,919
right so let's say

154
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:44,000
game.createsprite x is the

155
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,240
zero one you know zero one two three

156
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,039
four so we can have uh

157
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,360
rent in this is to give us a random

158
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:54,479
number from zero to four

159
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:57,680
and then y will be zero

160
00:05:54,479 --> 00:06:00,160
yeah so here you will every time

161
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,800
uh okay so there's a problem with this i

162
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,560
think this is the let's refresh this a

163
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,880
bit because i think this is not our

164
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,240
problem

165
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,680
hopefully

166
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,039
we'll come back

167
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,039
is it line 3

168
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,560
no no no

169
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,919
interesting so what happened i mean

170
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,890
so

171
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,280
this uh

172
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:28,479
[Music]

173
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,479
let's just turn a little bit

174
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:35,360
monster python okay why is it not coming

175
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,520
back yet

176
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,520
come on come on

177
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,919
okay look it has javascript here you can

178
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,840
look if i switch between javascript and

179
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,520
python look you can automatically

180
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,000
convert your code between javascript and

181
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,840
python yeah you know look look every

182
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,639
time look it now it's on the

183
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:55,199
last column yeah if i

184
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,960
it's the reset button it's this restart

185
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,720
the simulator if i do this look every

186
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,840
time it will be different right yeah

187
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:04,080
that's the random tradition you see

188
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:06,319
yeah because the x is the random integer

189
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,400
so what does it say a random returns a

190
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,240
should random number between mean and

191
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,120
max included

192
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,520
yeah

193
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,639
it's a random number what's random

194
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,800
it could be anything it could be

195
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,120
anything yeah mean max okay so that

196
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,440
these num that basically means that we

197
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,199
want to place uh we want to create an

198
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,360
apple pixel

199
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,319
which is placed randomly on the first

200
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:31,360
row which is this yellow and then x

201
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:35,520
position will be one of the five yeah

202
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,639
okay now what's next we have a u yeah u

203
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,080
yeah

204
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:44,759
let's say u yeah oh oh what

205
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,759
about we usually spell to catch

206
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:53,039
so but we wanted to place

207
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,160
our bar on the meter of the last row so

208
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,360
that would be

209
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,639
two and

210
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,800
four right

211
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:02,400
so if you do that here right that's a

212
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,280
little ball yeah look zero one two three

213
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,479
four

214
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:10,000
zero one two so it's two four okay

215
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:12,560
yeah this is about okay so now

216
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,639
what is we have this bar so we wanted a

217
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,960
function we want the game to

218
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,360
to to run yeah so we need a few

219
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,360
functions which is the

220
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,800
which is what uh

221
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,199
define

222
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,319
first of all we want to say move left

223
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:31,599
yeah or move left move left yeah

224
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,959
move left which is what so move left we

225
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,440
want the bow

226
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:37,279
to move minus one right

227
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,640
yeah so look if

228
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,320
if you keep

229
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,320
moving to the left if it hits the

230
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,240
boundary you'll stay there you you won't

231
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,279
go beyond the boundary so let's okay we

232
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,080
don't have to check if the pixel is is

233
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,399
on

234
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,480
you know it's falling on the left of the

235
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,959
screen right it's going on which we can

236
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,440
just say move to minus one right

237
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,399
define move right

238
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,640
all right

239
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,959
so bow dot

240
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,279
move one right yeah

241
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:08,080
yeah and then now we need we need to set

242
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:10,080
it uh associate to the button on button

243
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,640
a press yeah

244
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:15,680
button a press we want to if we want to

245
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,279
go on move left yeah

246
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,000
a button

247
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,360
move to the left and now we want it to

248
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,440
button b

249
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,839
we want to move to the right right okay

250
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,760
let's test this a little bit look

251
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,080
okay so now a

252
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,720
okay you won't go any further b

253
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:35,839
you can go any further yeah really

254
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:39,440
yeah okay now we want also the if we

255
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:41,040
want to own button press uh a and b i

256
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,120
think it's a and b

257
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,519
yeah a and b pressed together we wanted

258
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,560
to reset the game yeah so reset again i

259
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,120
haven't

260
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,600
uh written this function yet but let's

261
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,760
just put it here

262
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,279
to do it later yeah reset them okay

263
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,040
let's let's just put the placeholder

264
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:02,160
yeah

265
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,920
okay so now when the game is going so we

266
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,959
want the airport to keep falling right

267
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,200
yeah

268
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,240
so let's say define

269
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,079
uh

270
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,360
game men loop

271
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,600
band

272
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,760
so like apple should be apple should be

273
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,680
falling here apple should

274
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,160
be falling and this is a comment okay so

275
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,160
now we want to say basic

276
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,000
forever yeah

277
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,320
basically forever what does it mean so

278
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,399
it means that the game will will keep

279
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,200
doing this main loop here

280
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,680
right

281
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,360
yeah so now the apple should be falling

282
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,120
down right the apple should be falling

283
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,040
but before that we should wait a few

284
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,000
seconds yeah so let's say we have a game

285
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,680
speed falling speed okay speed falling

286
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,440
speed

287
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,760
falling speed will be

288
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,160
at the beginning will be

289
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,680
let's say um

290
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,519
okay

291
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,600
yeah yeah but we we have we we have to

292
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,279
come up with the concept how to to

293
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,839
control the speed okay so first of all

294
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,600
we have again i think and we actually

295
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,000
have oh look look game dot score yes

296
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,519
this game kendo score thing okay so at

297
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,240
the beginning like i think game the

298
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,800
score is zero okay so so we set them and

299
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,120
we also have uh have to define a game

300
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,040
over thing yeah but we we just put it

301
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,959
here for now game over

302
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,760
so forever look basically for i love

303
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:19,040
blue so now we just need to basic

304
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,399
the uh

305
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,480
pause

306
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,279
okay the plus

307
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:28,399
plus let's say just get current speed

308
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,399
okay get currency

309
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:38,720
pause get current delay okay delay

310
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,720
with the speed current uh speed

311
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,360
falling speed

312
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:47,519
okay so so we have to come up with a

313
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:50,639
function to you know we want the apple

314
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,639
to to fall as far uh

315
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:55,440
faster and faster yeah if you catch 10

316
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,880
apples the apples be falling faster

317
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,959
right if you catch

318
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,959
20 apples

319
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:03,279
that will be faster so how do we control

320
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:06,000
this variable so get current today with

321
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,959
the game.score okay

322
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,079
yeah

323
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,399
vendors go

324
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:13,279
and now we just have to do something

325
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:15,600
simple like if i get currently layer we

326
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:18,639
will just we just define this function

327
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,079
we want to uh we want to get to get a

328
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,560
score

329
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,639
variable okay so let's say

330
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,720
if let's just make it simple okay if

331
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:29,839
score small we can tune this function

332
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:32,160
later if we score eq smaller than five

333
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,480
yeah we will catch less than five apples

334
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,240
then we won't basically return one

335
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,600
second delay yeah within one second

336
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:42,639
today yeah one second today

337
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:45,680
yeah as

338
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:47,920
if score smaller than 10 right

339
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,600
bigger than five we only return

340
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,160
uh 500

341
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,079
at half second yeah otherwise we only

342
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,959
return

343
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:58,720
200 milliseconds here okay so

344
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,720
obviously this can be

345
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,560
implemented in many ways right so for

346
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,480
example if you catch one liter apple

347
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,480
that would be increasing the speed a

348
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,160
tiny bit yeah yeah that's one way but

349
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,000
we're using this we can come back to

350
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,720
this function later okay

351
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,240
okay following one one uh

352
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,920
phoning it and then what happened then

353
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,120
we need to say apple

354
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,000
dot

355
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,360
change

356
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,360
uh change by direction by one right

357
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,880
right so it's falling down right

358
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,880
right look then if apple

359
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,920
apple is

360
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:34,560
if what if apple is what this is

361
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,800
is touching edge right it's touching

362
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,800
edge

363
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:43,440
first of all we want to check if apple

364
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:46,000
is touching touching one touching

365
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,639
bar okay or you can say if bow is

366
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,959
touching apple okay similar it's the

367
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,120
same yeah if i touch you it's the same

368
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:55,839
as if you touch me

369
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,959
yeah so if let's say if bao is touching

370
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,760
apple

371
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:01,199
so if bao is touching apple then we what

372
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,360
what do we do

373
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,560
so we need to increment the score right

374
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,079
again the

375
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,440
score

376
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,720
score uh set score

377
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,760
cisco

378
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,760
game dot score

379
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,240
score plus one right we have what catch

380
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,560
one more airport right

381
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,199
right i'm right so but now what should

382
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:25,600
we do we should generally uh

383
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:28,000
we should move we should move uh upper

384
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,600
back right move upper back to the top

385
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,760
back to the top

386
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,760
okay it looks like

387
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,480
it's it's actually generating a new

388
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:39,760
apple but we we only have two objects

389
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,920
apple and u so we we just reuse the

390
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:45,040
upper objects to move it back to the top

391
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,959
makes sense

392
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,560
yeah you understand that meaning you

393
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:51,279
catch the apple right

394
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,600
apple is gone but here the apple is not

395
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,279
gone we just move it back to the top

396
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,079
yeah but it's the same thing to the user

397
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:59,839
right

398
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:02,320
okay so so moving back to the top so

399
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,639
what what should we do now we can say

400
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:07,279
apple dot

401
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:10,959
one uh

402
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:13,839
okay it doesn't talk uh if type of dot

403
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,839
set

404
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:19,760
okay it doesn't come up please okay i i

405
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,760
need to get this off

406
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,160
set

407
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,360
set uh

408
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,959
go to i think yes go to yeah go to

409
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,800
the second parameter is zero it means

410
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:33,199
the first row and the first parameter is

411
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:36,480
the same is that we can

412
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:38,720
yeah we can put this here yeah so

413
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,120
it means go to the top right

414
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:44,079
yeah and then low b here that will be

415
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:46,320
return okay now

416
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:48,639
if touching the edge so if it's touching

417
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,600
the edge that means the game over right

418
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:55,000
came over so we have came over

419
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,000
okay return

420
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:00,160
otherwise what should we do otherwise

421
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,040
otherwise we don't do anything right

422
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,480
yeah

423
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,120
all right

424
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,800
does it fall down no it doesn't fall

425
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,399
down that's weird okay so there's

426
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:13,040
something wrong with it

427
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:15,519
uh upper the change direction by one

428
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:18,560
post delay uh

429
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,560
the current delay

430
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:24,399
interesting why is not moving down

431
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,839
why is it normally not uh airport don't

432
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,839
move okay okay i see

433
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,639
apple don't move wait why is it why is

434
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,120
it moving

435
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:37,120
let's just test a little bit what is it

436
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,560
going down

437
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,120
let's just

438
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,720
comment this out yeah

439
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,920
so it doesn't actually this function

440
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,920
doesn't

441
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,759
make the apple going down so oh change

442
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,360
direction it's not changing like this

443
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,680
it's set by

444
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,320
okay set

445
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,320
set uh

446
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:58,320
change

447
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,480
change y by one okay so i i'm looking

448
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,759
for this function change by one okay so

449
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,519
it's not changing directly because it

450
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,199
changes direction it don't actually move

451
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,480
it stays there right

452
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,079
so it's uh

453
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,160
i i need to

454
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:13,280
put it here yeah okay and then let's do

455
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,559
it so you keep falling down

456
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,400
okay falling down yeah falling down

457
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:18,640
falling down from that phone it up catch

458
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,839
it score okay generally another one if i

459
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:24,079
don't catch it this time what happened

460
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:25,839
come over get more so what what should i

461
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,160
do with the game over and then i can i

462
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,160
can just

463
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,919
i should do what i should come over so i

464
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:37,039
should writing thinking yeah yeah yeah i

465
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:40,640
came over but i i would say

466
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:42,720
game dot show score right just go

467
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,520
okay so

468
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:48,160
let's say does it okay okay i'm going to

469
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:53,280
move a little bit to the right okay

470
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:56,559
okay that's the score yeah score equals

471
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:59,440
equals one yellow yeah yeah okay

472
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:02,160
yeah so basically that was yeah okay so

473
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,240
so let's reset again let's reset this a

474
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,160
bit okay now i'm catching this apple so

475
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,600
my score should be one okay

476
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,760
okay now i i

477
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,360
intentionally missed the apple okay so

478
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,120
what happened the score should be one

479
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,960
right

480
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,919
hopefully it should be one come on come

481
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,600
on

482
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,720
one yeah you see

483
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,000
yeah

484
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,400
okay so

485
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
so we get it so okay i think that's it

486
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,000
right so we have a few functions we

487
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,039
second so what do we do with every

488
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,360
second

489
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:32,080
so if we press a and b we should reset

490
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:36,080
again so we should again

491
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,080
this function is complete this one

492
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,320
so how do we reset the game that's a

493
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,960
very interesting

494
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:46,720
point if uh upper is

495
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:49,600
okay so why you keep doing this pause

496
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:52,000
pause change y touching touching

497
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,240
okay even every second i basically i

498
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,120
would just create a rewrite list a bit

499
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,039
yeah

500
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,039
so i will just rely this stupid

501
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,520
okay

502
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,600
so

503
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,480
let's do

504
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,240
okay look we have two more iphones

505
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,360
okay so that's not right because every

506
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:14,480
time we create it so recipient would be

507
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,559
apple dot delete first okay delete first

508
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,720
and then bar

509
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:21,919
we need to delete it first yeah

510
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,919
okay let's try this logic

511
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,919
reset uh

512
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,919
what reset kev

513
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,160
oh that's not right

514
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:39,120
why is r because the release set game i

515
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,360
the second is why is it not working in

516
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,360
this case

517
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:46,640
so probably i

518
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,640
i'm looking for a game

519
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:52,880
even the level of life wow lots of this

520
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,880
useful function okay game over ah we

521
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,400
should use this game game dot is game

522
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,799
over instead

523
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,280
so we we should just scan the show and

524
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:03,919
then come the game over and now make

525
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:07,280
things easier and then look at mandop

526
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:09,600
then if game is game over it's already

527
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,799
game over i should return right yeah all

528
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,000
right

529
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:15,760
yeah

530
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,919
so every second we have again the

531
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:20,240
uh

532
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:22,880
what else resume oh he even has this

533
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:25,039
pause and resume button

534
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,880
right so

535
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,640
let's don't worry about this for now

536
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,679
let's try again

537
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,600
okay

538
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,760
why is it

539
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,520
because of this i think it's probably

540
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,600
that let it just comment this oh i don't

541
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,559
get it at the moment

542
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,480
okay

543
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:42,960
why

544
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,960
what happened

545
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:50,480
pause change is touching go to

546
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,480
okay come over

547
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,840
look if

548
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,960
if

549
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,760
that's okay

550
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:02,320
the semicolon is allow python to put two

551
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:04,559
statements look you can say x equals 1 y

552
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:07,840
equals 1 here right then you can put it

553
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:09,360
2 in the same 9 x equals 1 and then y

554
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,080
equal 1 yeah

555
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:14,400
yeah that's the use that's the use usage

556
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:17,120
of the semicolon but it doesn't affect

557
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:19,280
anything so like why i just don't

558
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:22,320
understand why you would just just go

559
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:25,440
quickly what did i just do

560
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:27,679
huh what did i just do

561
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,480
three seconds it doesn't affect ah game

562
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,480
over show

563
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:37,200
[Music]

564
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,960
but you just immediately done that

565
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,200
yeah but that's a function

566
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,120
the function only

567
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,600
happens when

568
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,520
apple is touching the edge ah okay okay

569
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:51,200
because apple is touching the edge so

570
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:53,679
apple is the the top is also the edge

571
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,120
yeah so it when the apple plays on the

572
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,799
first row

573
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,280
then you're immediately touching the

574
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:02,480
edge you immediately came over right

575
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:04,400
yeah makes sense so so we should do this

576
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,679
so we instead of touching that we can

577
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,720
say if apple dot

578
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,600
y

579
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,640
uh

580
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,039
dot

581
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,400
y i think

582
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:16,559
republic

583
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,840
yeah equal equal four right

584
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,400
yeah

585
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,919
okay then let's target

586
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,440
yeah you see

587
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:25,840
okay

588
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:28,640
okay now let's take it let's restart uh

589
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,559
it doesn't do it okay because i haven't

590
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,280
i haven't reset the game so

591
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:36,080
let's put this back yeah please back

592
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:40,880
apple dot did it

593
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:42,799
uh did it and then bow down

594
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,640
and then we also need to reset the game

595
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,679
yeah we said

596
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,600
score

597
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,919
set score equals zero right because at

598
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,520
the beginning the score is zero right

599
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,280
yeah

600
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,480
and then

601
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,559
game

602
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,039
resume

603
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:02,000
restart resume

604
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:03,840
i think it's resumed right resume

605
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,400
when we create it now we resume let's

606
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:09,520
try this logic a little bit try

607
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,840
okay that's i move this

608
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,799
okay

609
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,080
okay

610
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:18,000
okay that's fine okay no no i i don't i

611
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,799
won't miss it

612
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
okay

613
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:26,720
game over and if i press this one okay

614
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:29,600
three seconds uh fails custom undefined

615
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,600
nine twenty seven

616
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:34,799
return two hundred

617
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:37,679
this is not right why is this

618
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:40,240
fair custom and define sim error okay so

619
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:42,799
i i believe this is not my problem

620
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:45,919
yeah let's try again

621
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:47,440
reset again uh why the second views

622
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,360
did it

623
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,640
probably doesn't like this one let's

624
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:54,720
just directly try this reset button

625
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,919
huh how do we reset the game

626
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,440
how to do this again let me check the

627
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:02,720
uh

628
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,720
how to really set the game

629
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:08,799
um probably we don't we just don't don't

630
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,799
reset again

631
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:14,480
yeah we don't need to uh okay okay

632
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,840
to

633
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,840
score we just need to

634
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,360
we just need to

635
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:30,720
set the score to zero

636
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:32,799
a little bit we probably don't need this

637
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,440
game

638
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:37,440
let's just do a little bit

639
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,200
we don't need to reset we just set the

640
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:43,039
score to zero

641
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:45,200
we just set the score to zero and i know

642
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:48,159
okay

643
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,360
we second okay

644
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,760
and then we

645
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,919
set a score then we need to upper needs

646
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,919
to

647
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,600
set y to zero to move to the first four

648
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,480
okay first first row okay let's try this

649
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,480
look

650
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:05,279
okay reset again and then move to the

651
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:08,080
top yeah okay and uh yeah a little bit

652
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:11,120
yeah okay so now it falls to the end it

653
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:14,400
come over and i press this one okay

654
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:16,960
interesting so it doesn't actually reset

655
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,640
but still it's kind of like a setting

656
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,799
okay maybe this is the higher result

657
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,120
okay so we don't worry about using these

658
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:25,039
to reset actually this is the result

659
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:28,000
reset the simulator

660
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:29,919
i see yeah yeah yeah so a plus we don't

661
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,720
actually resend the game

662
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:34,320
in in we don't actually reset the game

663
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,360
in in

664
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,600
in

665
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,840
in the logic we just use the simulator

666
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:44,159
to reset the game

667
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,159
i think that would be three seconds and

668
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,760
because we're calling the game over at

669
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:50,320
game over

670
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:53,840
so probably we can do this game

671
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,640
resume yeah let's let's try if we have

672
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,000
okay

673
00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:00,720
come over let's move to the right game

674
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,640
over yeah and then reset no it doesn't

675
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,480
affect so how can we bring the game back

676
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,520
to the live

677
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,919
because we're using this uh

678
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,600
uh another way another way because this

679
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:13,200
shows score and then

680
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,559
again the

681
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,039
pause

682
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:19,600
we use a pause and lb

683
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:22,960
pause when the game is passing now we if

684
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:25,679
the game is paused is is

685
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:28,240
post then we just return yeah

686
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:30,720
okay and then now we can do this resume

687
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,919
button let's try again

688
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,039
okay

689
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,919
okay you fall down fall down hold on

690
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:38,640
okay

691
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:40,080
and then press i get no it doesn't help

692
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,120
okay we reset

693
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,919
okay

694
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,919
we set this bit

695
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,520
okay now it goes to the top

696
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:52,880
okay so i actually i don't know why why

697
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:54,960
this it shows the score ah it shows the

698
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,960
score it pause

699
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,320
okay now it's zeroing the score yeah it

700
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,960
paused

701
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,960
score is zero

702
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,960
okay it's there and i'll press this okay

703
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,880
now it works because the yeah it's

704
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,400
working because this is the line 16

705
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,720
showing the score it was still showing

706
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,799
score it can't be interrupted

707
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,600
right so once it's slow it's there and

708
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,440
then

709
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,880
okay it's there then if you want to lose

710
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,320
that game press this and then start

711
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,960
again yeah

712
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:23,520
okay so now we can do this uh with the

713
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,360
score so probably we can come up with a

714
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:28,240
function to make it faster and faster

715
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:30,480
when the speed um

716
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,480
so let's say let's say let's come up

717
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:35,760
with this function

718
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:38,559
okay let's come up with the

719
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,840
yeah the score and the delay equals 500

720
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:41,600
minus time

721
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,600
you know when the score look when the

722
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:46,480
score is incrementing

723
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:48,799
the score is one the delay

724
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,159
when the score is zero delay is 500 when

725
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:53,360
the score is one

726
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:55,840
delay is 490 when score is 2 delay is

727
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:57,919
480 so it's becoming faster faster okay

728
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,200
now we have to set that limit

729
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,000
maximum

730
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,080
the

731
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,880
the minimum today is 50 then we can

732
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,399
replenish it okay now now you'll come

733
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,000
you will become faster and faster okay

734
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:10,640
let's try again look

735
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,919
let's just try okay okay faster

736
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:16,480
okay two you see it's faster

737
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:19,840
yeah you become faster and faster until

738
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,840
i lose it yeah come on

739
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:30,159
actually i can if i can make a logic and

740
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,320
i press level you you come up from the

741
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:34,399
right okay do you understand

742
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:37,039
yeah instead of going from left to right

743
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:39,279
okay i probably can't catch it anymore

744
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:40,240
okay i can still catch it i can still

745
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:42,320
catch it

746
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,679
i can still catch it i can still tell

747
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,600
you'll become faster and faster yeah

748
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,760
because of the apples i catch the score

749
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,760
is incrementing oh look at the score is

750
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:52,159
implementing the delay is the

751
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:54,880
decrementing the delay is decrementing

752
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:56,880
it means the epoch 22. the apple is

753
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:59,120
falling faster and faster yeah the

754
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,960
airport is falling fast faster so let's

755
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,799
what i'm saying that when the move minus

756
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,880
one you will he stopped at the left

757
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:07,120
boundary and one moved one it would stop

758
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:10,000
at the right boundary but instead i

759
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:13,440
could i could do what move one right if

760
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,520
move one and then look what i'm saying

761
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:18,399
is that if i can say bow

762
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:20,080
dot is touching if it's already touching

763
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:22,480
the edges right

764
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:24,000
touching the edges then i can say about

765
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,520
dot set

766
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,600
x would be

767
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,919
to the beginning yeah look

768
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,679
look okay all right

769
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:33,520
yeah touching the edge and the phone

770
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,840
yeah you see look

771
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:38,080
i can i can

772
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,240
oh wait we said again

773
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,440
uh let's just uh

774
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,520
okay

775
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,919
oh oh wait wait wait

776
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,919
if the logic is not power equals i'll

777
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:50,399
return return

778
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:53,200
i need to return it

779
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:54,880
okay let's try again

780
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,279
while i press the

781
00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:00,720
b will come to the left

782
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:02,559
move left minus one more y ah but

783
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,320
we are touching okay i make the same

784
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:06,559
mistake because it's touching the edge

785
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,000
right so what i'm saying is about

786
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:11,679
if bar the

787
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,480
dot x is is four then

788
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,039
yeah

789
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,039
if bar

790
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,520
dot x

791
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,720
equal zero then we say okay so now look

792
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,120
what happened

793
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,880
i can go to the right right and i press

794
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,559
right you come to the left i press left

795
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,320
you come to the right you can do do you

796
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:29,600
see my point

797
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,840
yeah so look

798
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:34,159
i catch this apple i press again and

799
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:36,480
come to the left yeah this is the way to

800
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:38,720
run up to wrap up your bow from the

801
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,120
other side right okay get more where we

802
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,640
talk about that yeah this bit a little

803
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,840
bit trickier

804
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:47,120
get current delay and more scores faster

805
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:50,080
less delay

806
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,760
and on button a press left on button y

807
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:54,240
press uh

808
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:56,399
on button b press uh go to the right and

809
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,080
this is the main loop of the logic got

810
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:00,000
it so basically

811
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,480
okay if game pause now just don't return

812
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,480
anything and that possibly falling so

813
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,880
first of all we make a delay we wait

814
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,799
today and then we change y by one so

815
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,159
we're falling down and if it's touching

816
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:12,240
the apple

817
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:14,320
we set the score increment score right

818
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,159
and then we move back look here we don't

819
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,600
regenerate the add problem right we

820
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:19,679
don't regenerate

821
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,519
so what do we do with this

822
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:24,240
when we when we eat the apple what do we

823
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,240
do with wrapper

824
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:30,640
we put it we we increment the score we

825
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:33,600
move it to the top right yeah and return

826
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:36,559
if if apple dot y equals four for the

827
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:38,559
last row right it means that we haven't

828
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:40,320
catch the app we haven't called apple we

829
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:42,559
haven't eaten apple but the apple is

830
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:44,159
size four and only ground so in this

831
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:46,399
case we need to written

832
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:49,039
game over yeah

833
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:50,880
make sense that's cool yeah okay let me

834
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:53,760
look if we look at this is the logic if

835
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,799
we turn into look look if if you do this

836
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,960
visually

837
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:59,600
yeah look this is visually we are doing

838
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,760
it on the code right doing individually

839
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:05,360
you can see how the

840
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:08,640
button ap plus then do this so yeah this

841
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:10,559
is visualization of your logic forever

842
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,399
yeah just pieces

843
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:14,880
yeah yeah it's just my password you put

844
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:17,600
all these puzzles together then they'll

845
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,360
get give you the game right but instead

846
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,200
what do we do with that we just use the
