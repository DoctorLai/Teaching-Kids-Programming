1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,120
go

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,040
hello mr harry are you right

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,399
yeah we have talked about the games in

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,160
these few days we talked about a

5
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:09,280
two-player zero sum game we have two

6
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,639
player

7
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:15,120
to play a zero sum one takes i play i

8
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,119
make a move you make a move yeah i know

9
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,279
exactly what happened on

10
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:21,119
on the game and you know the same

11
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,640
exactly let's call two players zero some

12
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:26,080
game

13
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,560
i play to win yeah i win you lose yeah i

14
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,599
lose you win yeah let's do that

15
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,480
okay

16
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,680
is the pokemon car uh zero some game two

17
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,200
player

18
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,040
pokemon

19
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,120
that's poke

20
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,640
like that pokemon do you know

21
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,680
play poker cars

22
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,840
is there a two player zero sum game

23
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,840
is

24
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,239
you're not sure

25
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:54,320
i mean for the pokemon cards

26
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,360
to is it a two player

27
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,199
no

28
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,559
it could be many player multiplayer but

29
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,039
the thing is that

30
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:04,879
the player does not know i'm not playing

31
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,720
not really yeah so i play the podcast i

32
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,680
don't know what happened on your hand

33
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,600
yeah

34
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,880
so this is not a two-player zero-sum

35
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,000
game because

36
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,000
the play each player is

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,960
all the players do not share the same

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,960
kind of information right yeah

39
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,360
you don't know what's in my hand right

40
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,159
that's not to play zero something

41
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,680
we talk about the mean math

42
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,320
max

43
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,640
index is a kind of search agreement for

44
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,759
the in the game tree right so we have a

45
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,560
max

46
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,720
we have a tree yeah we have a three

47
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,880
again uh the note that would be each

48
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,320
note will be the state of the game in

49
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,040
each state

50
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,200
so one player is trying to maximizing it

51
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,960
the other one is trying to minimizing it

52
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,000
okay so it takes time right it takes

53
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,600
time

54
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,840
so for example this one is trying to

55
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,799
maximize this one try to minimize and

56
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,119
it's going to max mine minimizing

57
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:02,479
okay so main max

58
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:04,880
yeah i will also talk about the

59
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,840
the simplified implementation of mini

60
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,440
max which is called nega max yeah

61
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,680
megamax the problem of the min max is

62
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,080
what is that

63
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,400
in its implementation we have to

64
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,480
write the same bit of code twice right

65
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,319
so if maximizing we are trying to find

66
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,640
the max value

67
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:25,120
among each kid

68
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,080
and if it's minimizing you know we're

69
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,640
trying to

70
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,440
find the minimum value of the kit

71
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,959
and these two bits of codes are similar

72
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,280
it's just different

73
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,920
directions right so with the negative

74
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,000
max we're simplifying both scenarios

75
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,360
combining both scenarios in one function

76
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,640
without the

77
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,720
um

78
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,720
if statement if checked so the

79
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:53,920
so you just both cases will be trying to

80
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,840
maximize the value how how does it work

81
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,360
why is that because look if we want to

82
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,920
get the maximum

83
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,319
of a and b what does it equal

84
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,720
if we put a sign

85
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,480
minus a minus b

86
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,959
if we get the mean

87
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,519
and then b equal to the mean we put a

88
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,040
sign negative sign out

89
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,519
yeah

90
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,519
all right

91
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,920
is it all right let's say

92
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,280
10

93
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,080
20

94
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,560
so let's put the sign over minus 10

95
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,040
minus 20. so what's the minimum what is

96
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,840
20 minus

97
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,319
minus 20 is the minimum so minus 20 for

98
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,879
the two sign turns out that'll be 20

99
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,040
that's the thing we're looking for right

100
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:41,440
yeah this equation how does that how do

101
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,440
we prove that if we saying a is bigger

102
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,640
than equal to b right

103
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,280
max

104
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,840
max a b will be

105
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,480
a right yeah if we say a is bigger than

106
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,560
equal than b no max a b

107
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,439
and b is the same it's the same it's

108
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,560
still it still stands here

109
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:02,640
it's this thing right okay so if a

110
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,760
a is bigger or equal than b if i put a

111
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:09,120
negative put a sign look if i negate the

112
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,000
sign so minus a is smaller than minus b

113
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,599
okay

114
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,560
yeah because we change the sum we have

115
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:17,600
to change the sign changing the you know

116
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,519
change from bigger equal to less equal

117
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,680
right i know which

118
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,919
uh which one is smaller

119
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,800
this one obviously yeah

120
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,520
and then

121
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,639
if we put the negative sign in front of

122
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,520
b

123
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,120
a

124
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,360
yeah which is

125
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,960
exactly the same here

126
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,040
yeah okay we just move it

127
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,360
so relax max

128
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,520
simplify it so let's quickly write the

129
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,199
megamax and then we come coming back to

130
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,120
this other better premium because we

131
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,080
talked about alpha beta pruning but it's

132
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,720
still

133
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:54,400
we have to use the big if statement to

134
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:56,160
distinguish between two scenarios

135
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,919
okay i'm going to write the mean max

136
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,639
first mega man

137
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,880
connect max

138
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,479
we have a state

139
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,759
we have a tabs

140
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,840
we have

141
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,240
what

142
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,240
player

143
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,360
maximizing minimizing player agent

144
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,520
opponent

145
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:26,000
if d is zero if we reach

146
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,120
the depth yeah

147
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,680
or

148
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,080
the state is the end state it's end it's

149
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,520
the end state it's the leaf node

150
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,600
of the gantry

151
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,520
what's n state

152
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,720
and say what does this mean what's

153
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,840
insane

154
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,759
and

155
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,919
yeah and and what kind of scenario for

156
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,440
the tic-tac-toe game what's the answer

157
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,680
in the room or

158
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,680
um

159
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:54,000
so someone has wing someone has one or

160
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,280
is a draw so that is three kinds of

161
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,280
scenario yeah agent win we give a

162
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,919
positive infinity

163
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,319
opponent we give a negative infinity or

164
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:06,800
nobody wins we give a zero

165
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,720
yeah so we return

166
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,600
in this case we return a

167
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,160
score evaluation of heuristic score of

168
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,000
the state so let's say score

169
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,240
state

170
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,240
now we're trying to

171
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,520
because this is negan x so we can

172
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,759
combine both scenario into one we we set

173
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,800
the initial score to negative infinity

174
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,600
and i'm trying to maximize in both cases

175
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,960
for

176
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,080
action

177
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,240
in

178
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,880
action okay so for kids in the state

179
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,560
okay so this is the action would be

180
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,039
the actions

181
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,600
of the state yeah what's the next move

182
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:45,360
prosper and then the new state

183
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,000
news day would be

184
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,520
the successor success of the current

185
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,680
state this is

186
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,440
return a new state with the current

187
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,639
action

188
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,160
and then

189
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,280
score

190
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,960
equals maximum of score okay so this is

191
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,199
the magic and we talked about let's go

192
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,919
equals mathematician and we are trying

193
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,240
to go to go to the next round so which i

194
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:10,720
need to put the negative sign yeah

195
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,120
knacker max this is where the net net

196
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,880
max what's negative x

197
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,680
what's the negative yeah put a negative

198
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,199
sign and a new state and we pass in the

199
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,840
new state

200
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,319
and the test will be minus one yeah we

201
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,120
if we initially give a

202
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,680
d

203
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,160
depth the maximum test we can search the

204
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,240
tree we set the hard limit okay so this

205
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,039
is the game tree yeah this is the

206
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,039
country if we're saying okay okay we i'm

207
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:40,000
setting the hard limit

208
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,520
to step three so everything after

209
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,080
we just don't care for the moment

210
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:47,840
because of the limited resources well

211
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,440
once i got on the computer to play con

212
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:53,520
connect for

213
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:55,680
peter and then when i was like uh

214
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:59,120
just about yes

215
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:01,120
nearly like to plan to win and then and

216
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,840
then the competitive like

217
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,280
computers like kick me out the game why

218
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,000
is there they can put the kick kill out

219
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,840
again and then yes and then i guess

220
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,319
what's connect4 um is like

221
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:16,479
um this square and then drop um

222
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:19,120
control i i don't know what you talk

223
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,120
about um

224
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,720
well i'm not sure if you use different

225
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,560
color if you want them

226
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,360
okay so these are

227
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,640
slots here yeah well it's not exactly oh

228
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,200
yeah

229
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,440
well you dropped you drop these counters

230
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,080
in and it drops to the bottom

231
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,240
and then and then and then and then you

232
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,360
have and then and then you can put some

233
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,680
on top

234
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,440
and then you have to make four in a row

235
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,519
so is it the two player game you're

236
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,160
playing against the computer so you make

237
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,320
one move the computer make one move yeah

238
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,480
okay interesting maybe i can this is

239
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,640
like

240
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,640
i see okay

241
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,440
okay so the computer kick you out again

242
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,959
why is that i don't know i just

243
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,240
okay but i guess that's a different

244
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,519
reason okay

245
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,560
anyway

246
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,880
okay very interesting and i look it up

247
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,760
d minus one and then player player we

248
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:18,240
need to neglect as a player as well okay

249
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,600
okay so this is the net max so how about

250
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,040
if we what

251
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,800
how about we introduce the the alphabet

252
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,959
accordingly let's let's review a little

253
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:30,399
bit of beta okay

254
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:33,120
i say this is three this is five

255
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:36,080
and then if i have this six here if

256
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,399
we're trying to maximize here

257
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,680
yeah and then here's some something i

258
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,440
don't care

259
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:45,920
something i don't care if something i

260
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,920
don't care yeah okay i don't care here

261
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,440
so this is three five so i have five

262
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,800
here so we are minimizing here

263
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,080
minimizing it

264
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,080
okay so what's the value here

265
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,800
um

266
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,440
five

267
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,519
sorry why is that because this x is what

268
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,680
we are getting the maximum so x we find

269
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,600
the first kid is six so what does it

270
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:11,120
mean this note is

271
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,519
x is what people are equal and six right

272
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,040
yeah if x is bigger than equal to six

273
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,839
and we are getting the minimum in the

274
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:20,320
inspiration what does it mean here look

275
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:22,480
so this is bigger than six this is five

276
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,279
so what five is the winner

277
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,360
right

278
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,160
even we haven't explored this

279
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,920
yeah

280
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,720
we never explore that we don't care this

281
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,959
is uninteresting and interesting to us

282
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,760
right because it doesn't change the fact

283
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:37,600
that x is bigger or equal than six

284
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,600
look yeah so

285
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,440
so this is very useful you just

286
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,600
print it print it

287
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,959
so in order to prune this as much as

288
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:49,920
possible we need to okay so this is the

289
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,920
thinking right a question in order to

290
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,200
have this kind of thing we prefer to cut

291
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:57,120
up this

292
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:59,600
as much as we can so in order to do that

293
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,640
we need to

294
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,200
we need to search if we can order if we

295
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:08,399
can sort the these these the kids on the

296
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,200
same error so do we need to solve the

297
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,680
best

298
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:15,000
uh explore the best moves or the worst

299
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,000
moves first

300
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:22,640
yeah i know so in order to have this as

301
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,320
cut-off as not

302
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,920
as possible

303
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,920
it's better we

304
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,959
search we explore the trees with the

305
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,079
moves

306
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,480
that

307
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:36,480
is the best move first right

308
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,040
yeah am i right does it make sense yeah

309
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,079
yeah because look if i search this first

310
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,399
what happened

311
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,839
there is no cut off right it matters the

312
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,079
order of the

313
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,720
the order of the kids look i can i can i

314
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:51,040
can search these three this note first

315
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,279
or i can search this no first

316
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:56,399
right but if i search this no first

317
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:58,480
there will not be cut off you you can't

318
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,680
you can't promote right because you

319
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,240
don't know right

320
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,320
you don't know there's a five

321
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,720
that doesn't make sense

322
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,079
five comparing to this note

323
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,399
this is better

324
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,760
so i have to arrange the notes of the

325
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,959
same level

326
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,560
such that

327
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,800
the best moves

328
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,240
are export first

329
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,720
make sense

330
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,800
yeah why is that because if i install

331
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,200
the best move this is kind of best

332
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,160
better yeah good good move

333
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,320
yeah

334
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,720
yeah if i explore this first

335
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,800
like then i have more chance

336
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,399
to

337
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:39,040
to decide to cut it right we want that

338
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,480
because the higher chance to cut it

339
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,639
means that

340
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,440
you can be lazy yeah yeah yeah it could

341
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:47,680
be a bit quicker yeah exactly okay okay

342
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,880
so with this this is the other that

343
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,360
happened

344
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,440
so remember we we talked about alpha

345
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,760
beta pruning and we can implement it

346
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,079
using the min max yeah but the problem

347
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:01,279
is that you have to say if player is

348
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:04,480
maximizing then we do this bit of code

349
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:06,480
which is similar to minimizing it the

350
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,560
pro look

351
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,120
this is megamax

352
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:14,399
how is it compared to minimax come on

353
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:18,480
which one is better me max or megamax

354
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,480
why is that it's because you can

355
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:24,959
because what compared to if this is the

356
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:27,120
same as min max but it's the simple

357
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:29,839
the implementation is a lot simpler yeah

358
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,399
i don't have to check if

359
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:34,320
and you don't have to write a lot

360
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,160
wait

361
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,360
so first of all i need to

362
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,360
put uh to

363
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,240
to introduce alphabet opening i have

364
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:45,120
this other and better yeah

365
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,480
yeah alpha better other is basically the

366
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,480
left boundary

367
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,360
better is the right boundary

368
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,360
yeah

369
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:55,120
yeah everything out

370
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:58,000
will be trimmed you know the trim

371
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:01,040
yeah similar the meaning of the pruning

372
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,160
if it falls there it's like a fence

373
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:06,160
yeah yeah if it falls out of the left

374
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,079
window we cut it further the right

375
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:11,279
window we cut it yeah

376
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:12,800
okay so alpha beta so this is the same

377
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:17,600
yeah so we have to

378
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:18,399
to put uh to give two parameters of that

379
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,880
yeah

380
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:23,920
so first of all i have to

381
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:26,320
do this alpha will be equals max

382
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,480
alpha score okay we keep updating that

383
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,560
we keep pushing the up left boundary

384
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,360
okay look keep pushing the left boundary

385
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,639
at least and then if other is bigger

386
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,639
than beta

387
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,959
then we just cut up right we just

388
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:41,199
terminate the roof

389
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:43,760
okay so now look this is the same but in

390
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:46,079
order to to go to the next one we call

391
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,240
it alpha beta here

392
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:50,480
we have to update the alpha beta

393
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,440
boundary so what what values do i need

394
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,199
to give to the next one the new alpha

395
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,519
data value

396
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,519
can you guess

397
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:05,360
okay so alpha beta

398
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,199
the next round will be what

399
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,880
look i put this negative sign here so i

400
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:13,279
put everything negative

401
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,279
negative

402
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,040
it's a good letter

403
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,040
greek

404
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:47,120
looks quite similar to a but it's

405
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,720
actually not it's a greek letter quick

406
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,720
you know quick

407
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,720
quick

408
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:55,590
[Music]

409
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,379
[Music]

410
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,920
and then put r

411
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:14,560
look alpha beta and then we'll pass the

412
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:17,279
the minus beta will be the new alpha

413
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,880
minus alpha will be new beta okay yeah

414
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,480
exactly yeah because look if you put a

415
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,399
sign

416
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,519
if we put a sign alpha is smaller than

417
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:27,759
even better if we put this line whatever

418
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:30,000
plus and then

419
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:32,399
minus alpha is bigger or equal to minus

420
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,600
beta right so this is the lower boundary

421
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,040
make sense

422
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,079
this becomes the

423
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:40,480
upper boundary yeah

424
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:42,720
did you get it look

425
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,920
one is smaller than 100

426
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,440
yeah

427
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,519
so minus 1

428
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,279
is bigger or equal than minus 100. you

429
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,639
see when you put a negative sign we have

430
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,079
to change this

431
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,440
yeah

432
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:56,399
make sense

433
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,160
okay so today we're learning uh so today

434
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:02,079
we learned what

435
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:05,919
um we just learned how to implement

436
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:07,839
the alpha beta in the next max right so

437
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:10,480
in the negative and we also talk about

438
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:13,039
the ordering of the moves the action

439
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:16,959
so in here action action so we have to

440
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:19,120
we can to introduce we can put a sorted

441
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,720
salty yeah

442
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,120
we can salted this

443
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,600
why is that

444
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:28,400
we can put the salty that moves

445
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:30,880
from the bed from the good moods to the

446
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:34,640
worst moons i mentioned it just five

447
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,640
minutes ago do you still remember

448
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:39,200
for the actions yeah remember the trees

449
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,000
i want to explore the trees with the

450
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,200
moon

451
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,280
back a good moon first

452
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,160
so why is that it's because you can

453
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:50,160
discard it later on yeah if i this is a

454
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,720
very good move right

455
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,400
if this is a very good move then there's

456
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,760
a higher chance that i don't need to

457
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,840
explore this

458
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,960
yeah but if this is

459
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,360
worse move

460
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,480
then i can't if i still need to explore

461
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,880
it right

462
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,080
make sense yeah so the ordering of the

463
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,720
moves uh

464
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:11,360
help a lot in the alpha beta tuning okay

465
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,880
so we mentioned this okay so today we so

466
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,840
okay so last question what have you

467
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,840
learned today

468
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,200
alpha beta this is the look this is the

469
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,960
alphabet

470
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,280
on the megamax right

471
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,840
yeah we talked about alphabet a few days

472
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,960
ago but we we have to

473
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,960
to

474
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,840
this theorem what i mean

475
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:38,000
implementation if player is maximizing

476
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,919
to this bit yeah

477
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,240
as do another bit

478
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,640
similar to yeah

479
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,559
it's pretty long yeah the trick is what

480
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,720
we put the negative sign here

481
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,400
everything is trying to maximize look

482
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,799
the score is always

483
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,559
negative infinity which is the smallest

484
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,720
number we can think of

485
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:59,600
and then because

486
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,360
when we change a player

487
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,520
yeah we change the player the score

488
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,760
needs to be negated right

489
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,320
a hundred score is good for me it's bad

490
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,640
for you right so when i pass the 100

491
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:13,280
score to the next one

492
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:17,520
in the perspective of you

493
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:19,440
it's like up minus 100. am i right

494
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,320
do you do get this point opposite

495
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,120
opposite yeah because 100 is good for me

496
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,679
right

497
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:28,240
so when i pass the score to you it's not

498
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:30,320
100 to you it's minus 100 because it's

499
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,720
good yeah yeah yeah

500
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:35,280
yeah yeah so this is where the negative

501
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:38,480
comes from and then we just keep

502
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:40,720
passing the alpha beta boundary and then

503
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,520
in each round we keep updating the left

504
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,960
boundary until it hits the right

505
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,480
boundary then

506
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,200
we break okay

507
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,360
okay nobody today

508
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,799
say bye to people bye

509
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,280
bye bye

510
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,280
bye
