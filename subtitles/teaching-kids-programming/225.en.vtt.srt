you find the largest
 

19
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,950
you find the largest

00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:36,960
number which is what largest odd number
 

21
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,549
number which is what largest odd number
is five

22
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:38,559

then you return nothing okay because

then you return nothing okay because
 

61
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,990
then you return nothing okay because
there's no odd number right you can't

there's no odd number right you can't

make
 

65

a number right but yeah you all right we

66
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:10,959
a number right but yeah you all right we
 

67
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,550
a number right but yeah you all right we
stand from the right hand side

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,309

what's the first number what's the index

100
00:03:00,309 --> 00:03:00,319
what's the first number what's the index
 

101
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,550
what's the first number what's the index
right no no no we start from the right

102
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:02,560
right no no no we start from the right
 

103
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,630
right no no no we start from the right
into the left minus one

104
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:04,640
into the left minus one
 

105
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,030
into the left minus one
okay but then we start with length as

106
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,040
okay but then we start with length as
 

107
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,110
okay but then we start with length as
minus one and what's the stop

108
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:09,120
minus one and what's the stop
 

109
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,630

what's the second parameter minus one
 

113
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:28,149
what's the second parameter minus one
what's the third parameter

the number of the length of the string
 

221
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,629
the number of the length of the string
okay the length of string okay got it

222
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:14,639
okay the length of string okay got it
 

223
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,390
okay the length of string okay got it
okay so look what's this okay that's it

we want to convert this to integer how
 

239
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,790
we want to convert this to integer how
can i convert this to from

240
