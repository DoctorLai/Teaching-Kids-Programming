1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
hello mr mr ryan are you right yes okay

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:08,000
so we're giving uh something

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,760
we said some words eric

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,960
eric

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,400
and

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,880
happy

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,119
ryan and

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,920
okay okay so we are given a sentence of

9
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:24,000
words separated by white space the first

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:26,800
one is eric the second one is ryan so

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,840
that could be many eric could be many

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:33,600
ryan in a string so the question is that

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:36,399
what's the shortest distance between

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,559
any error to any right in this string i

15
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,559
mean

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,480
two yeah yeah okay the shot is distance

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,879
means the number of words between those

18
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,480
right so look there are two words yeah

19
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:52,320
two words between everything right and

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,320
that's the closest all right

21
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,840
and okay if i add that right in here

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,120
what's the shortest distance between l

23
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,920
eric bryan 0 yeah 0. to repeat we are

24
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,080
given a string of words separated by y

25
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,080
space and we are given two words we want

26
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,479
to find out the shortest distance

27
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,400
that is different as defined as the

28
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,600
number of words between

29
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,600
any

30
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:20,240
what one on any one if there's no error

31
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,840
or if there's no ryan in the sentence

32
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,520
we'll return minus one okay

33
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,600
yeah first of all spread them that's

34
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:31,520
very good so first of all we split the

35
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:34,799
string yeah so array equals s dot split

36
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,799
so we split the string into array of

37
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,720
words so how do we solve this i just

38
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,200
need a general idea it doesn't have to

39
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,600
be a concrete

40
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,520
yeah we're going to enumerate and how

41
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,640
how do we do it

42
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,520
index

43
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:54,399
yes index of the word so how do we deal

44
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,399
with the index i visually see the word

45
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:12,399
so yeah you just connect this eric eric

46
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,399
you collect one index yes

47
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,160
and then what do you do suppose okay so

48
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,560
the index for ryan yeah index for ryan

49
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:24,000
is zero five right

50
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,720
i'm not index for eric is one two right

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,120
you

52
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,920
you find if there's like

53
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,080
do you just visually see this oh yeah

54
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,840
yeah it's still not yeah i understand

55
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,040
but fear not visually

56
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,920
yeah size which is this size this is two

57
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,920
it's yeah

58
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,840
and this is also two which is perfect

59
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,959
because you just maybe you just find the

60
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:50,000
smallest one

61
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,720
but this one is sorted so that's good

62
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,280
wait

63
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,519
this one is the smallest

64
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,959
and this is also the smallest

65
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:01,040
and and then you can just do like this

66
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,000
is the biggest and then this is the

67
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,440
biggest

68
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
this is roommate three and this and

69
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,000
smallest

70
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,480
one

71
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,720
this could be many many numbers instead

72
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,400
of two so it could be many many numbers

73
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,400
like zero two three four five okay for

74
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,440
the first one and the second one could

75
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,159
be many cases one two

76
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,480
six eight okay then you just do the

77
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,239
smallest one

78
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,200
smallest one yeah

79
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,680
see

80
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,440
you sure but look if the smallest one

81
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,760
could be like that

82
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,720
so clearly five this is four different

83
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,159
but

84
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,560
right here

85
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,000
the tree is starting with the maxima do

86
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,640
you see my point

87
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,120
so it doesn't work right yes we have

88
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,519
these two arrays sorted array

89
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,360
a and b sorted array

90
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,920
how do you find the smallest distance

91
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,439
between any two numbers in an array okay

92
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,920
that's the question man

93
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,439
what's the method to ask computers to

94
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,319
try

95
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,879
yeah

96
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:07,439
we can prove for them all right we can

97
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:10,000
profit the numbers but this does not use

98
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:12,799
the fact that they are both sorted right

99
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,560
yeah and in fact if we pull forcing the

100
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,280
time conductor will be o and square

101
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,919
right yeah orange square okay because we

102
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,639
have to find the pairs right right

103
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,919
this is too slow okay this is the key

104
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,800
thing today

105
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:28,800
yes this method could work if the size

106
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,680
of the string is small then possibly

107
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,080
that's okay we collect the index for

108
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,919
those words and i will try to pull first

109
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,720
any number from

110
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:41,280
ryan any number from eric and i try to

111
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,080
to see which two numbers

112
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,240
have a shortage distance right

113
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,080
that's very slow another way first of

114
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,840
all we obviously we need to split the

115
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,600
sentences forward we'll go through the

116
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,400
word yeah if it's the any of these words

117
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,120
right

118
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:00,320
then we check if it is the same as the

119
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,080
previous one if it's the same as the

120
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,240
last recorded one

121
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,320
okay if it's not then that's the

122
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:10,320
certificate we calculated

123
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:12,320
if it is we just update it i'm last okay

124
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,320
at the beginning i set it to 9. the

125
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,880
index here is 0.

126
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,520
this word is one of the areas in line

127
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,560
right it's in here we haven't made any

128
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:26,000
of these so i just set it to last equals

129
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:29,360
to zero right because it means that last

130
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,680
uh partition the last place that

131
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,120
any of these words appear is at index

132
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,600
zero okay

133
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,400
okay eric here

134
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,240
now i thought this is also in one of

135
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,880
these words so i check

136
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,280
if it's the same as the last one it's

137
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,120
not right it's not the answer would be

138
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,440
the minimum of these the distance would

139
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,440
be zero last i need to set it to one

140
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,560
right because this is one of the words i

141
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,680
we just met

142
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,240
eric is equal to the last so

143
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,960
i don't check the answer anymore

144
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,759
instead i update it to

145
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:07,199
2. to sum up we just go through the list

146
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:10,400
of words and then every time we update

147
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,759
the last index if we meet one of these

148
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,880
words right

149
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:17,680
and if this word current word is not the

150
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,600
same as last word we calculate distance

151
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,520
and remember the smallest

152
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:25,600
mean

153
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:29,120
mean distance as first of all ar equals

154
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:31,919
s dot split we split the sentence

155
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,680
at the beginning answer equals infinity

156
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,600
and the

157
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,840
last and the beginning we started to

158
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:41,120
numb this is the last place

159
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,080
that one of these words appear w1 or w2

160
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,039
for

161
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:48,560
the index and the current

162
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:49,840
in numerator what's eliminated

163
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,840
certainly

164
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:56,400
groups yeah yeah with what what's this

165
00:06:53,840 --> 00:07:00,160
index what's this

166
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,199
i x in enumerate these so what what's i

167
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,639
index

168
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,680
one two three

169
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,680
what's the value of x

170
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,280
uh

171
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:12,560
yeah that's what it means so current is

172
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:15,360
the words the words right the words look

173
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,919
remember that eric ryan thing yeah

174
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,560
every lion thing this is the list of

175
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,880
words we converted okay

176
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:26,319
if current is in

177
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:28,720
w1 or w2 right right if it's in one of

178
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:31,840
these words if first of all last is not

179
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:35,360
not right because at the pin is not and

180
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:37,520
if the current is not equal to

181
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,479
that that stores the index it's not

182
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:43,199
equal to array last

183
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:46,960
right then we calculate the distance my

184
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:49,120
answer equals the minimum of answer

185
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:52,080
current index is i

186
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,160
the previous index is last

187
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,479
the number of words between them is

188
00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:00,240
minus one all right the number of index

189
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:02,720
two this is eric this is ryan this index

190
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,680
is 2 this index is 3. how many words

191
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,599
between what everything right here

192
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,440
okay so how do we get zero this is two

193
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:13,120
index two this is index three how do we

194
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:15,759
get zero three minus two that's one

195
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:19,039
minus one yeah yeah we need to minus one

196
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:21,840
here look here's what i mean

197
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,599
okay and then look after every time it's

198
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:27,599
in the carbon right so we need to set

199
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:28,720
the last equals i right and then return

200
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:32,880
answer

201
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:34,240
if answer is not equal to infinity s

202
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,200
minus 1 right

203
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,599
if it's equal to infinity we don't find

204
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,959
anything here we don't find one of these

205
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:45,440
words so it's infinity okay

206
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:46,880
time for next t o n right space

207
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,800
complexity

208
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,320
we are using the array so let's space

209
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,839
complex p o n okay

210
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,120
to sum up what have you learned today

211
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,839
what's the problem and what have you

212
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,839
learned and that's it

213
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,959
what's the problem

214
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:06,240
the minimum difference of two words in

215
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,120
the sentence well not really something

216
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,519
yeah

217
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:13,200
sorry uh the distance between two words

218
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,680
in this kind of

219
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:19,800
long sentences

220
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,800
[Music]

221
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,160
and then check

222
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,399
the second one and check if it's

223
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,480
just same as the

224
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,920
last one yeah yeah you're getting there

225
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,040
yes and

226
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,200
if it

227
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,240
is

228
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,800
you just update it yeah

229
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,399
and you go to the next one

230
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,640
uh slightly

231
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,959
incorrect here so we always remember

232
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,120
that update the last one and if it's

233
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,640
only different right if it's the current

234
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,720
world it's different than the last one

235
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,240
we calculated this time all right

236
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,240
if it doesn't there's no point to

237
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,920
calculate right yeah

238
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,440
do you get it

239
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:18,440
okay that's it for today bye-bye

240
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,440
bye-bye
