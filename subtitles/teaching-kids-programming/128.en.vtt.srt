1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,390

hey hello mr mr ryan how are you today

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:04,400
hey hello mr mr ryan how are you today
 

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,670
hey hello mr mr ryan how are you today
good good yeah okay wait

4
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:07,680
good good yeah okay wait
 

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,790
good good yeah okay wait
a little bit yeah so today we talk about

6
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:10,800
a little bit yeah so today we talk about
 

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,430
a little bit yeah so today we talk about
uh graph do you remember what is graph

8
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:13,440
uh graph do you remember what is graph
 

9
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,310
uh graph do you remember what is graph
remember

10
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:14,320
remember
 

11
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:20,870
remember
we talked about the gravity

12
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:20,880

 

13
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,710

is not exactly like kind of like wow

14
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:22,720
is not exactly like kind of like wow
 

15
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,070
is not exactly like kind of like wow
we're talking about the graph data

16
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:24,080
we're talking about the graph data
 

17
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,189
we're talking about the graph data
structure remember

18
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:25,199
structure remember
 

19
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,990
structure remember
the tree is also a graph right yeah the

20
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:28,000
the tree is also a graph right yeah the
 

21
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,310
the tree is also a graph right yeah the
link is is also a graph yeah

22
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:30,320
link is is also a graph yeah
 

23
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,310
link is is also a graph yeah
so graph is like with notes and edges

24
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:34,320
so graph is like with notes and edges
 

25
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,670
so graph is like with notes and edges
right yeah with notes and edges

26
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:37,680
right yeah with notes and edges
 

27
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,950
right yeah with notes and edges
so for example like an edge edge

28
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:40,960
so for example like an edge edge
 

29
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,869
so for example like an edge edge
the graph and the edges in the graph can

30
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:42,879
the graph and the edges in the graph can
 

31
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:44,950
the graph and the edges in the graph can
have directions or not directions if it

32
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:44,960
have directions or not directions if it
 

33
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,549
have directions or not directions if it
has direction like arrows

34
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:46,559
has direction like arrows
 

35
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,750
has direction like arrows
like one to the two then we call it

36
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:49,760
like one to the two then we call it
 

37
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,790
like one to the two then we call it
directive graph

38
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:52,800
directive graph
 

39
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,510
directive graph
directive graph yeah and if it doesn't

40
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:55,520
directive graph yeah and if it doesn't
 

41
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,389
directive graph yeah and if it doesn't
have

42
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:56,399
have
 

43
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,790
have
the error we call it what i'm directing

44
00:00:58,790 --> 00:00:58,800
the error we call it what i'm directing
 

45
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,069
the error we call it what i'm directing
graph yeah

46
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:00,079
graph yeah
 

47
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,590
graph yeah
all right and i repeat what my bank is

48
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:03,600
all right and i repeat what my bank is
 

49
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,630
all right and i repeat what my bank is
automatic

50
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:04,640
automatic
 

51
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,910
automatic
and graphic and the the

52
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:07,920
and graphic and the the
 

53
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,070
and graphic and the the
you can associate the edge with some

54
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:10,080
you can associate the edge with some
 

55
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,590
you can associate the edge with some
values so we call it weight

56
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:11,600
values so we call it weight
 

57
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,789
values so we call it weight
yeah weight right

58
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:14,799
yeah weight right
 

59
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,630
yeah weight right
okay does it make sense okay so now

60
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:18,640
okay does it make sense okay so now
 

61
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,469
okay does it make sense okay so now
the task today is very simple so you're

62
00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:20,479
the task today is very simple so you're
 

63
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:21,910
the task today is very simple so you're
given a star

64
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:21,920
given a star
 

65
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,990
given a star
graph you know what star graph so it

66
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:24,000
graph you know what star graph so it
 

67
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,190
graph you know what star graph so it
only has one

68
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:25,200
only has one
 

69
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,230
only has one
stars one in the middle and then many

70
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:28,240
stars one in the middle and then many
 

71
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,710
stars one in the middle and then many
edges

72
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:30,720

 

73
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,789

yeah when it is you have to have one in

74
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:32,799
yeah when it is you have to have one in
 

75
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:33,910
yeah when it is you have to have one in
the middle

76
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:33,920
the middle
 

77
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,710
the middle
so basically it's like a a common node

78
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:38,720
so basically it's like a a common node
 

79
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,429
so basically it's like a a common node
connects to all the rest of nodes right

80
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:41,439
connects to all the rest of nodes right
 

81
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,230
connects to all the rest of nodes right
and then

82
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:42,240
and then
 

83
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,789
and then
for the only one one edge

84
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:46,799
for the only one one edge
 

85
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,109
for the only one one edge
between each other nodes to the middle

86
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:49,119
between each other nodes to the middle
 

87
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,030
between each other nodes to the middle
okay so and you're given this node a

88
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:51,040
okay so and you're given this node a
 

89
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:51,510
okay so and you're given this node a
graph

90
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:51,520
graph
 

91
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,389
graph
you're given this graph g in the format

92
00:01:54,389 --> 00:01:54,399
you're given this graph g in the format
 

93
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:55,830
you're given this graph g in the format
of

94
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:55,840
of
 

95
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,190
of
uh in the format of a

96
00:01:59,190 --> 00:01:59,200
uh in the format of a
 

97
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,630
uh in the format of a
b so a list of that yeah h one and

98
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:02,640
b so a list of that yeah h one and
 

99
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,630
b so a list of that yeah h one and
two right like some c d like that

100
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:06,640
two right like some c d like that
 

101
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,790
two right like some c d like that
so this is that from for example like

102
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:10,800
so this is that from for example like
 

103
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,990
so this is that from for example like
a to the b okay and then maybe

104
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:14,000
a to the b okay and then maybe
 

105
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,869
a to the b okay and then maybe
b to the d okay something like that yeah

106
00:02:16,869 --> 00:02:16,879
b to the d okay something like that yeah
 

107
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,309
b to the d okay something like that yeah
doesn't make sense

108
00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:18,319
doesn't make sense
 

109
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,750
doesn't make sense
yeah right

110
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:21,760
yeah right
 

111
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,030
yeah right
so this is the list of the flow

112
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:25,040
so this is the list of the flow
 

113
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,589
so this is the list of the flow
list of edges for each one is the edges

114
00:02:27,589 --> 00:02:27,599
list of edges for each one is the edges
 

115
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,229
list of edges for each one is the edges
from

116
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:28,239
from
 

117
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,910
from
vertex to two vertices

118
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:31,920
vertex to two vertices
 

119
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,589
vertex to two vertices
okay so now uh given this graph can you

120
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:35,599
okay so now uh given this graph can you
 

121
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:41,509
okay so now uh given this graph can you
find the one in the middle

122
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:41,519

 

123
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,630

for example and then and i have a c here

124
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:44,640
for example and then and i have a c here
 

125
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,350
for example and then and i have a c here
so

126
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:45,360
so
 

127
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,710
so
here would be c to b or b to c it

128
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:48,720
here would be c to b or b to c it
 

129
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,550
here would be c to b or b to c it
doesn't matter okay so as you can see

130
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:50,560
doesn't matter okay so as you can see
 

131
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,790
doesn't matter okay so as you can see
the edge can be represented using two

132
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:52,800
the edge can be represented using two
 

133
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,270
the edge can be represented using two
notes

134
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:53,280
notes
 

135
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,670
notes
from and two and these can be solved

136
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:55,680
from and two and these can be solved
 

137
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,390
from and two and these can be solved
yeah it doesn't matter yeah because it's

138
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:57,400
yeah it doesn't matter yeah because it's
 

139
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,350
yeah it doesn't matter yeah because it's
undirected

140
00:02:59,350 --> 00:02:59,360
undirected
 

141
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,110

[Music]
 

143
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,430
[Music]
yeah so any idea here omo you're very

144
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:03,440
yeah so any idea here omo you're very
 

145
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,630
yeah so any idea here omo you're very
close to it

146
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:04,640
close to it
 

147
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,430
close to it
what's the idea how we're doing this and

148
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:07,440
what's the idea how we're doing this and
 

149
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,070
what's the idea how we're doing this and
we can

150
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:08,080
we can
 

151
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,190
we can
look you know what we can what's this in

152
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:11,200
look you know what we can what's this in
 

153
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,949
look you know what we can what's this in
degree

154
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:12,959
degree
 

155
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,070
degree
what does it mean of the vertex b okay

156
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:16,080
what does it mean of the vertex b okay
 

157
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,589
what does it mean of the vertex b okay
so let's say in degree of

158
00:03:17,589 --> 00:03:17,599
so let's say in degree of
 

159
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,949
so let's say in degree of
vertex b equals equals what

160
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:20,959
vertex b equals equals what
 

161
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,550
vertex b equals equals what
one two three four five six and a

162
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:24,560
one two three four five six and a
 

163
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,750
one two three four five six and a
index let's say this is i found

164
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:27,760
index let's say this is i found
 

165
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,949
index let's say this is i found
i a equals one i

166
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:30,959
i a equals one i
 

167
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,670
i a equals one i
d equals one so can you tell me what's

168
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:33,680
d equals one so can you tell me what's
 

169
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,229
d equals one so can you tell me what's
in degree

170
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:36,239

 

171
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,110

in degree of a note b is six integrator

172
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:39,120
in degree of a note b is six integrator
 

173
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,869
in degree of a note b is six integrator
of adc is or one

174
00:03:42,869 --> 00:03:42,879

 

175
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:56,660

so what does this in degree mean

176
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:56,670

 

177
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:02,949

[Music]

178
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:02,959

 

179
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,070

so in degree is the number of ages

180
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:06,080
so in degree is the number of ages
 

181
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,429
so in degree is the number of ages
coming in like yeah right out

182
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:09,439
coming in like yeah right out
 

183
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,190
coming in like yeah right out
oh oh because it's on degree and

184
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:11,200
oh oh because it's on degree and
 

185
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,710
oh oh because it's on degree and
directly so it doesn't matter so it's

186
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:12,720
directly so it doesn't matter so it's
 

187
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,470
directly so it doesn't matter so it's
not basically the number of edges

188
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:14,480
not basically the number of edges
 

189
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,830
not basically the number of edges
connected to this point

190
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:15,840
connected to this point
 

191
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,229
connected to this point
so in degree of b look at how many edges

192
00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:18,239
so in degree of b look at how many edges
 

193
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:19,349
so in degree of b look at how many edges
six yeah

194
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:19,359
six yeah
 

195
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,270
six yeah
yeah so can you tell me how do we deal

196
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:21,280
yeah so can you tell me how do we deal
 

197
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,990
yeah so can you tell me how do we deal
with this from my input

198
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,000

 

199
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,110

any idea so how do we find the center

200
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:29,120
any idea so how do we find the center
 

201
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,790
any idea so how do we find the center
one

202
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:30,800
one
 

203
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,950
one
come on it's all very obvious right it's

204
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:32,960
come on it's all very obvious right it's
 

205
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,230
come on it's all very obvious right it's
in a star graph

206
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:34,240
in a star graph
 

207
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,230
in a star graph
there's only one edges one one vertex

208
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:38,240
there's only one edges one one vertex
 

209
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,390
there's only one edges one one vertex
vertex we call it vertical okay we know

210
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:40,400
vertex we call it vertical okay we know
 

211
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,310
vertex we call it vertical okay we know
that vertex that has

212
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:42,320
that vertex that has
 

213
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,749
that vertex that has
the is it has the largest

214
00:04:45,749 --> 00:04:45,759
the is it has the largest
 

215
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,670
the is it has the largest
in degree right or it points in a 3d

216
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:49,680
in degree right or it points in a 3d
 

217
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,870
in degree right or it points in a 3d
shape yeah yeah yeah but to these as

218
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:52,880
shape yeah yeah yeah but to these as
 

219
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,189
shape yeah yeah yeah but to these as
well

220
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:53,199
well
 

221
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,230
well
so if layer and point

222
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:56,240
so if layer and point
 

223
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,350
so if layer and point
so look n is seven right seven seven

224
00:04:59,350 --> 00:04:59,360
so look n is seven right seven seven
 

225
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,790
so look n is seven right seven seven
vertex yeah

226
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:00,800
vertex yeah
 

227
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,990
vertex yeah
right one two three four five six seven

228
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:04,000
right one two three four five six seven
 

229
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,830
right one two three four five six seven
so what's the integral of the middle one

230
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:05,840
so what's the integral of the middle one
 

231
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,029
so what's the integral of the middle one
it given us a

232
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:07,039
it given us a
 

233
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,830
it given us a
star graph what's how many edges

234
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:09,840
star graph what's how many edges
 

235
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,510
star graph what's how many edges
connected to this

236
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:11,520
connected to this
 

237
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,029
connected to this
uh six so what's what what it is

238
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:15,039
uh six so what's what what it is
 

239
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,150
uh six so what's what what it is
and what

240
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:18,160
and what
 

241
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,469
and what
any seven so how many edges connecting

242
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:20,479
any seven so how many edges connecting
 

243
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,710
any seven so how many edges connecting
to the middle one

244
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:24,720
to the middle one
 

245
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,749
to the middle one
six yeah i know six is what

246
00:05:27,749 --> 00:05:27,759
six yeah i know six is what
 

247
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,950
six yeah i know six is what
six is n minus one

248
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:30,960
six is n minus one
 

249
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,390
six is n minus one
yeah come on okay so we can compute the

250
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:34,400
yeah come on okay so we can compute the
 

251
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,870
yeah come on okay so we can compute the
in degree right of each vertex right

252
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:38,880
in degree right of each vertex right
 

253
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,430
in degree right of each vertex right
yeah and then return the one who is the

254
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:41,440
yeah and then return the one who is the
 

255
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,310
yeah and then return the one who is the
maximum

256
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:42,320
maximum
 

257
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,510
maximum
into it i'm i'm i'm right yeah and

258
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:45,520
into it i'm i'm i'm right yeah and
 

259
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,430
into it i'm i'm i'm right yeah and
what kind of data structure are we using

260
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:47,440
what kind of data structure are we using
 

261
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,189
what kind of data structure are we using
can can we use to

262
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:49,199
can can we use to
 

263
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,390
can can we use to
compute the in uh to store the key value

264
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:52,400
compute the in uh to store the key value
 

265
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,430
compute the in uh to store the key value
players

266
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:53,440
players
 

267
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,390
players
in degree key value pairs key value pair

268
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:56,400
in degree key value pairs key value pair
 

269
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,749
in degree key value pairs key value pair
you know key value pair what

270
00:05:57,749 --> 00:05:57,759
you know key value pair what
 

271
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,670
you know key value pair what
what's the the thing you like you know

272
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:01,680
what's the the thing you like you know
 

273
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,629
what's the the thing you like you know
look at me like that what's that yes

274
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:04,639
look at me like that what's that yes
 

275
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,309
look at me like that what's that yes
come on notebook

276
00:06:06,309 --> 00:06:06,319
come on notebook
 

277
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,990
come on notebook
okay look

278
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:10,000
okay look
 

279
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,670
okay look
let's say define find

280
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:13,680
let's say define find
 

281
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,909
let's say define find
center okay center and we got given this

282
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:17,919
center okay center and we got given this
 

283
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:22,390
center okay center and we got given this
graph which is the list right right

284
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:22,400
graph which is the list right right
 

285
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,830
graph which is the list right right
yeah so let's say maybe

286
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:25,840
yeah so let's say maybe
 

287
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,189
yeah so let's say maybe
uh graph okay let's say that in degree i

288
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:29,199
uh graph okay let's say that in degree i
 

289
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:29,830
uh graph okay let's say that in degree i
equals

290
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:29,840
equals
 

291
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,070
equals
dictionary right dictionary so

292
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:34,080
dictionary right dictionary so
 

293
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,790
dictionary right dictionary so
default additionally

294
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:38,800

 

295
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,749

additional and integer type because we

296
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:41,759
additional and integer type because we
 

297
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:42,469
additional and integer type because we
are

298
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:42,479
are
 

299
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,469
are
going to store the number of edges

300
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:44,479
going to store the number of edges
 

301
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,309
going to store the number of edges
connecting to that node right

302
00:06:46,309 --> 00:06:46,319
connecting to that node right
 

303
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,350
connecting to that node right
all right four

304
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:49,360
all right four
 

305
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,950
all right four
let's say h h1 h2

306
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:52,960
let's say h h1 h2
 

307
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,670
let's say h h1 h2
so h1 is this error the first number s2

308
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:55,680
so h1 is this error the first number s2
 

309
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,510
so h1 is this error the first number s2
is the second number

310
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:57,520
is the second number
 

311
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,270
is the second number
in g then i

312
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:01,280
in g then i
 

313
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,390
in g then i
e1 what i

314
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:04,400
e1 what i
 

315
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,029
e1 what i
e2 can you tell me what to do yeah

316
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:09,039

 

317
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,830

because currently a b and then we have

318
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:11,840
because currently a b and then we have
 

319
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,390
because currently a b and then we have
edge

320
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:12,400
edge
 

321
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,390
edge
connecting with we have an edge

322
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:14,400
connecting with we have an edge
 

323
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,189
connecting with we have an edge
connecting between e1

324
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:17,199
connecting between e1
 

325
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,029
connecting between e1
and e2 right it's undirected so

326
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:21,039
and e2 right it's undirected so
 

327
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,270
and e2 right it's undirected so
what's the in degree what happens in

328
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:23,280
what's the in degree what happens in
 

329
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,909
what's the in degree what happens in
degree for both vertex

330
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:27,919

 

331
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,950

very simple look we have we now finally

332
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:30,960
very simple look we have we now finally
 

333
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,749
very simple look we have we now finally
find an

334
00:07:31,749 --> 00:07:31,759
find an
 

335
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,029
find an

00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:51,840
okay so after this now we want to
 

353
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,070
okay so after this now we want to
we have a i map we want to return the

in here is e1 3 and then e2

378
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:29,039
in here is e1 3 and then e2
 

379
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,749
in here is e1 3 and then e2
2 right then you you will return e1

380
00:08:31,749 --> 00:08:31,759
2 right then you you will return e1
 

381
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:32,550
2 right then you you will return e1
because

382
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:32,560
because
 

383
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,509
because
e1 has the largest value error three but

384
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:35,519
e1 has the largest value error three but
 

385
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,070
e1 has the largest value error three but
this is

386
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:36,080
this is
 

387
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,750
this is
what it means right alternatively you

388
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:39,760
what it means right alternatively you
 

389
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,990
what it means right alternatively you
can do this max

390
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:42,000
can do this max
 

391
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,670
can do this max
i dot items

392
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:45,680

 

393
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:53,030

right and then key equals

394
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,040

 

395
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,949

a a1 is a bit complicated

396
00:08:56,949 --> 00:08:56,959
a a1 is a bit complicated
 

397
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,630
a a1 is a bit complicated
and then return the first value yeah

398
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:58,640
and then return the first value yeah
 

399
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,350
and then return the first value yeah
because this this tells the

400
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:01,360
because this this tells the
 

401
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,550
because this this tells the
max function how are we comparing with

402
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:04,560
max function how are we comparing with
 

403
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,750
max function how are we comparing with
the

404
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:05,760
the
 

405
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,870
the
uh how are we comparing and get the max

406
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:08,880
uh how are we comparing and get the max
 

407
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,750
uh how are we comparing and get the max
this item is like a one three two two a

408
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:11,760
this item is like a one three two two a
 

409
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,230
this item is like a one three two two a
pair

410
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:12,240
pair
 

411
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,870
pair
a tuple i know we're saying that we want

412
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:14,880
a tuple i know we're saying that we want
 

413
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,790
a tuple i know we're saying that we want
to compare with the value

414
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:16,800
to compare with the value
 

415
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,509
to compare with the value
and then you will return this pair and i

416
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:19,519
and then you will return this pair and i
 

417
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,230
and then you will return this pair and i
i

418

get the key by square uh uh by the

420
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:23,519
get the key by square uh uh by the
 

421
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,750
get the key by square uh uh by the
bracket square bracket zero right

422
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:25,760
bracket square bracket zero right
 

423
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,670
bracket square bracket zero right
by square bracket one is three but it's

424
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:27,680
by square bracket one is three but it's
 

425
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,230
by square bracket one is three but it's
it this way is simpler i mix i t with i

426
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:30,240
it this way is simpler i mix i t with i
 

427
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:30,949
it this way is simpler i mix i t with i
don't get

428
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:30,959
don't get
 

429
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,630
don't get
i don't get it's a message to get a

430
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:32,640
i don't get it's a message to get a
 

431
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,630
i don't get it's a message to get a
value okay so this is basically having

432
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:34,640
value okay so this is basically having
 

433
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,590
value okay so this is basically having
that i want to return the key which has

434
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:37,600
that i want to return the key which has
 

435
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,150
that i want to return the key which has
the largest value three so if the

436
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:40,160
the largest value three so if the
 

437
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,990
the largest value three so if the
this one and it becomes center that

438
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:42,000
this one and it becomes center that
 

439
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,700
this one and it becomes center that
makes sense yeah

440
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:43,710
makes sense yeah
 

441
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,350

so look we can because

444
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:49,600
so look we can because
 

445
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,949
so look we can because
because all we know we know uh it's the

446
00:09:52,949 --> 00:09:52,959
because all we know we know uh it's the
 

447
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:53,910
because all we know we know uh it's the
graph is

448
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:53,920
graph is
 

449
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,590
graph is
a star right right

450
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:57,600
a star right right
 

451
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,990
a star right right
so what does it mean if we found the

452
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:00,000
so what does it mean if we found the
 

453
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,870
so what does it mean if we found the
edge

454
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:00,880
edge
 

455
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,670
edge
which has more than one in degree it's a

456
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:03,680
which has more than one in degree it's a
 

457
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,710
which has more than one in degree it's a
center right

458
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:04,720
center right
 

459
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,990
center right
does it make sense yeah yeah

460
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:08,000
does it make sense yeah yeah
 

461
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,389
does it make sense yeah yeah
okay so we can just do this if

462
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:12,399
okay so we can just do this if
 

463
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,069
okay so we can just do this if
i e1

464
00:10:16,069 --> 00:10:16,079
i e1
 

465
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,990
i e1
bigger than one then return

466
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:20,000
bigger than one then return
 

467
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,509
bigger than one then return
e1 and here if

468
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:23,519
e1 and here if
 

469
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:31,190

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:37,030
yeah so what's the term complexity
between this one and

503
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,110
can we do better can we do it
maybe i will

504
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:13,120

 

505
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,630

a wait c so look

506
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:16,640
a wait c so look
 

507
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:21,829
a wait c so look
let's do this a b and b d okay uh

508
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:21,839

 

509
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,030

okay a b all right look at this square

510
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:25,040
okay a b all right look at this square
 

511
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,040
okay a b all right look at this square
let's let's see i have

512
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,050

okay actually look at the first two
 

517
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,470
okay actually look at the first two
notes bbc

518
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:38,480
notes bbc
 

519
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,509
notes bbc
so okay tv so look

520
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:41,519
so okay tv so look
 

521
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,710
so okay tv so look
we know this is the first edge this is

522
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:44,720
we know this is the first edge this is
 

523
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,750
we know this is the first edge this is
the second edge

524
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:45,760
the second edge
 

525
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,430
the second edge
and a connecting the b b connecting to d

526
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:49,440
and a connecting the b b connecting to d
 

527
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,069
and a connecting the b b connecting to d
so can we find by comparing the first

528
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:52,079
so can we find by comparing the first
 

529
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,350
so can we find by comparing the first
center note

530
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:53,360
center note
 

531
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,629
center note
comparing the first two notes

532
00:11:56,629 --> 00:11:56,639
comparing the first two notes
 

533
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:01,490
comparing the first two notes
yeah can we do it

534
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:01,500

think about it look hey let's see if a

538
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:08,880
think about it look hey let's see if a
 

539
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,509
think about it look hey let's see if a
e if a yeah the first note first edge of

540
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:11,519
e if a yeah the first note first edge of
 

541
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,350
e if a yeah the first note first edge of
the first note right

542
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:13,360
the first note right
 

543
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,470
the first note right
is also one in one of second edge

544
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:16,480
is also one in one of second edge
 

545
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,030
is also one in one of second edge
then is the center right yeah i know y

546
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:19,040
then is the center right yeah i know y
 

547
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,509
then is the center right yeah i know y
is b

548
00:12:19,509 --> 00:12:19,519
is b
 

549
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,389
is b
right because look b appears in both

550
00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:22,399
right because look b appears in both
 

551
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:22,870
right because look b appears in both
right

552
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:22,880
right
 

553
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,470
right
it's the center note because b b

554
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:26,480
it's the center note because b b
 

555
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,509
it's the center note because b b
appears in both edges

556
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:29,519
appears in both edges
 

557
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,949
appears in both edges
right so what does it mean if it appears

558
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:32,959
right so what does it mean if it appears
 

559
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,670
right so what does it mean if it appears
it's a sentinel right like if look a is

560
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:35,680
it's a sentinel right like if look a is
 

561
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,430
it's a sentinel right like if look a is
not in the center it's not in the post

562
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:37,440
not in the center it's not in the post
 

563
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,389
not in the center it's not in the post
80s

564
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:38,399
80s
 

565
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,310
80s
right so it's not sentinel it must be on

566
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:40,320
right so it's not sentinel it must be on
 

567
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,150
right so it's not sentinel it must be on
the edge right

568
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:42,160
the edge right
 

569
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,269
the edge right
yeah if a is not a center of b must be

570
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:45,279
yeah if a is not a center of b must be
 

571
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,389
yeah if a is not a center of b must be
your sentinel right

572
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:46,399
your sentinel right
 

573
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,590
your sentinel right
i'm right does it make sense

574
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:49,600
i'm right does it make sense
 

575
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,710
i'm right does it make sense
because in an age there must be one note

576
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:52,720
because in an age there must be one note
 

577
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,629
because in an age there must be one note
in the edge that is a sentinel right

578
00:12:54,629 --> 00:12:54,639
in the edge that is a sentinel right
 

579
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,150
in the edge that is a sentinel right
does it make sense

580
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:56,160
does it make sense
 

581
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,750
does it make sense
yeah look at this is star 12

582
00:12:59,750 --> 00:12:59,760

 

583
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,030

so every age there must be one of the

584
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:03,040
so every age there must be one of the
 

585
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,629
so every age there must be one of the
note in every age

586
00:13:04,629 --> 00:13:04,639
note in every age
 

587
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,670
note in every age
it's the central right

588
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:07,680
it's the central right
 

589
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,750
it's the central right
it doesn't make sense okay so look how

590
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:09,760
it doesn't make sense okay so look how
 

591
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,230
it doesn't make sense okay so look how
how can we write it look

592
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:12,240
how can we write it look
 

593
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,590
how can we write it look
if g the first no

594
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:15,600
if g the first no
 

595
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,870
if g the first no
first note of the first g zero eric

596
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:18,880
first note of the first g zero eric
 

597
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,230
first note of the first g zero eric
look you tell me g zero is this one and

598
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:22,240
look you tell me g zero is this one and
 

599
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,230
look you tell me g zero is this one and
g zero zero is a right

600
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:24,240
g zero zero is a right
 

601
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,910
g zero zero is a right
if equals g

602
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:27,920
if equals g
 

603
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,750
if equals g
one zero if equals to this one

604
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:31,760
one zero if equals to this one
 

605
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,550
one zero if equals to this one
or

606
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:33,560

so basically if this now is the same as

610
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:53,360
so basically if this now is the same as
 

611
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,590
so basically if this now is the same as
this now or this now right

612
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:55,600
this now or this now right
 

613
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,829
this now or this now right
return one reason why

614
00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:00,839

617
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:18,069

that if it is now it's the same as this

618
00:14:18,069 --> 00:14:18,079
that if it is now it's the same as this
 

619
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,230
that if it is now it's the same as this
no all this no then it must be essential

620
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:20,240
no all this no then it must be essential

this one is essential all right does it

make sense
 

627
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,430

yeah what's the time complexity

00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:29,440

 

629
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,550

come on oh

630
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:32,560
come on oh
 

631
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,670
come on oh
i won a one yes because look i'm just

632
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:35,680
i won a one yes because look i'm just
 

633
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,629
i won a one yes because look i'm just
checking that

634
00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:36,639
checking that
 

635
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,670
checking that
but yeah i i heard you say oh oh and

636
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:39,680
but yeah i i heard you say oh oh and
 

637
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:56,310
but yeah i i heard you say oh oh and
right yeah oh

638
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:56,320

 

639
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,550

which one is this one better open this

640
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:58,560
which one is this one better open this
 

641
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,750
which one is this one better open this
one why is that

642
00:14:59,750 --> 00:14:59,760
one why is that
 

643
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,710
one why is that
because i said

644
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:04,720

 

645
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,870

why yeah why this one is better i won

646
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:08,880
why yeah why this one is better i won
 

647
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,389
why yeah why this one is better i won
and why o1 is better than quicker

648
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:12,399
and why o1 is better than quicker
 

649
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,389
and why o1 is better than quicker
it's quicker yeah because look one means

650
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:14,399
it's quicker yeah because look one means
 

651
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,550
it's quicker yeah because look one means
constant it means no matter how big

652
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:16,560
constant it means no matter how big
 

653
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,189
constant it means no matter how big
the graph is i can always check the

654
00:15:19,189 --> 00:15:19,199
the graph is i can always check the
 

655
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:19,990
the graph is i can always check the
first two

656
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:20,000
first two
 

657
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,870
first two
elements i'm right yes and that's

658
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:22,880
elements i'm right yes and that's
 

659
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,230
elements i'm right yes and that's
constant time right

660
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:24,240
constant time right
 

661
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,870
constant time right
but for the previous one i need to go

662
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:26,880
but for the previous one i need to go
 

663
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,389
but for the previous one i need to go
through

664
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:28,399
through
 

665
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,189
through
right possibly edges yeah to to count

666
00:15:31,189 --> 00:15:31,199
right possibly edges yeah to to count
 

667
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:31,910
right possibly edges yeah to to count
the edges

668
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:31,920
the edges
 

669
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,829
the edges
but not the second approach remember the

670
00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:33,839
but not the second approach remember the
 

671
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:34,949
but not the second approach remember the
first approach

672
00:15:34,949 --> 00:15:34,959
first approach
 

673
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,749
first approach
is o n the second approach is actually

674
00:15:37,749 --> 00:15:37,759
is o n the second approach is actually
 

675
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:38,870
is o n the second approach is actually
not o n

676
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:38,880
not o n
 

677
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,150
not o n
is one because we know we know what we

678
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:42,160
is one because we know we know what we
 

679
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:42,870
is one because we know we know what we
know

680
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:42,880
know
 

681
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,150
know
this is a star graph right

682
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:46,160
this is a star graph right
 

683
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,069
this is a star graph right
so for the second approach remember if

684
00:15:48,069 --> 00:15:48,079
so for the second approach remember if
 

685
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,069
so for the second approach remember if
it's bigger than one

686
00:15:50,069 --> 00:15:50,079
it's bigger than one
 

687
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,790
it's bigger than one
then we return that immediately right

688
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:52,800
then we return that immediately right
 

689
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,150
then we return that immediately right
come right yeah

690
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:54,160
come right yeah
 

691
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,110
come right yeah
do you still remember the second one so

692
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:57,120
do you still remember the second one so
 

693
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,509
do you still remember the second one so
we checked we counted in degree for each

694
00:15:59,509 --> 00:15:59,519
we checked we counted in degree for each
 

695
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,629
we checked we counted in degree for each
item

696
00:16:00,629 --> 00:16:00,639
item
 

697
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,949
item
we integrated for each vertex and if

698
00:16:02,949 --> 00:16:02,959
we integrated for each vertex and if
 

699
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,389
we integrated for each vertex and if
it's more than one

700
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:04,399
it's more than one
 

701
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,189
it's more than one
in degree now we return that so by going

702
00:16:07,189 --> 00:16:07,199
in degree now we return that so by going
 

703
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,629
in degree now we return that so by going
through that look

704
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:08,639
through that look
 

705
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,949
through that look
you can always find that in degree more

706
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:10,959
you can always find that in degree more
 

707
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,110
you can always find that in degree more
than one

708
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:13,120
than one
 

709
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,670
than one
for the first two for the first two

710
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:15,680
for the first two for the first two
 

711
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,030
for the first two for the first two
edges right because look

712
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:17,040
edges right because look
 

713
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,230
edges right because look
b b and the second point and the second

714
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:20,240
b b and the second point and the second
 

715
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,389
b b and the second point and the second
iteration of the for loop the b

716
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:22,399
iteration of the for loop the b
 

717
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,590
iteration of the for loop the b
in degree will be what area

718
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:25,600
in degree will be what area
 

719
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,189
in degree will be what area
all right will be what the integral of b

720
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:29,199
all right will be what the integral of b
 

721
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,350
all right will be what the integral of b
going through the first edges second as

722
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:31,360
going through the first edges second as
 

723
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,310
going through the first edges second as
the integral of b

724
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:32,320
the integral of b
 

725
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,990
the integral of b
is what in degree of b is

726
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:36,000
is what in degree of b is
 

727
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,949
is what in degree of b is
a and the integra how many edges there's

728
00:16:38,949 --> 00:16:38,959
a and the integra how many edges there's
 

729
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,629
a and the integra how many edges there's
this one edges there are two edges how

730
00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:40,639
this one edges there are two edges how
 

731
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,470
this one edges there are two edges how
many edges is connected to b

732
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:42,480
many edges is connected to b
 

733
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,670
many edges is connected to b
two two okay then we found the answer

734
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:45,680
two two okay then we found the answer
 

735
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,629
two two okay then we found the answer
immediately so

736
00:16:46,629 --> 00:16:46,639
immediately so
 

737
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,269
immediately so
for the first two first algorithm is our

738
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:49,279
for the first two first algorithm is our
 

739
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:50,069
for the first two first algorithm is our
n for the second

740
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:50,079
n for the second
 

741
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,870
n for the second
one is a one for the third one is also

742
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:52,880
one is a one for the third one is also
 

743
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,470
one is a one for the third one is also
one which is quicker

744
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:54,480
one which is quicker
 

745
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,550
one which is quicker
right the second and third one is almost

746
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:56,560
right the second and third one is almost
 

747
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,990
right the second and third one is almost
the same yeah

748
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:58,000
the same yeah
 

749
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,430
the same yeah
but this one is more straightforward

750
00:16:59,430 --> 00:16:59,440
but this one is more straightforward
 

751
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,350
but this one is more straightforward
because it's just using the if

752
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:01,360
because it's just using the if
 

753
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,549
because it's just using the if
yeah right does it make sense yeah okay

754
00:17:04,549 --> 00:17:04,559
yeah right does it make sense yeah okay
 

755
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:05,029
yeah right does it make sense yeah okay
that's it

756
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:05,039
that's it
 

757
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:12,079
that's it
for today bye-bye
