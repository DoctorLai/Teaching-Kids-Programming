hello guys and today we're gonna do

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:02,800
hello guys and today we're gonna do
 

3
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:03,830
hello guys and today we're gonna do
coding

4
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:03,840
coding
 

5
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,550
coding
yeah that's my dad he's gonna be the

6
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:06,560
yeah that's my dad he's gonna be the
 

7
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,829
yeah that's my dad he's gonna be the
teacher

8
00:00:07,829 --> 00:00:07,839
teacher
 

9
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,070
teacher
miss terry how how are you mr white how

10
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:10,080
miss terry how how are you mr white how
 

11
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,830
miss terry how how are you mr white how
are you good

12
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:11,840
are you good
 

13
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,830
are you good
you're talking about the target yeah

14
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:13,840
you're talking about the target yeah
 

15
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,070
you're talking about the target yeah
today i'm giving a number okay so

16
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:16,080
today i'm giving a number okay so
 

17
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,550
today i'm giving a number okay so
let's say given the number five and then

18
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:18,560
let's say given the number five and then
 

19
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,230
let's say given the number five and then
we want to convert it to nine

20
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:20,240
we want to convert it to nine
 

21
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,470
we want to convert it to nine
how do we do it every time yeah it's

22
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:22,480
how do we do it every time yeah it's
 

23
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,950
how do we do it every time yeah it's
four

24
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:24,960

 

25
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,390

right try okay so you can you can do

26
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:28,400
right try okay so you can you can do
 

27
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:28,790
right try okay so you can you can do
what

28
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:28,800
what
 

29
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,229
what
you can find that nine no no no you can

30
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:32,239
you can find that nine no no no you can
 

31
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:37,030
you can find that nine no no no you can
plus one or you can times two

32
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:37,040
plus one or you can times two
 

33
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,790
plus one or you can times two
none of them work no you can minus one

34
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:40,800
none of them work no you can minus one
 

35
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:52,229
none of them work no you can minus one
or you can times two

36
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:52,239

 

37
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,630

minus one all you can times two multiply

38
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:54,640
minus one all you can times two multiply
 

39
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,389
minus one all you can times two multiply
two that doesn't make any sense

40
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:56,399
two that doesn't make any sense
 

41
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,189
two that doesn't make any sense
so look how can you oh you times t and

42
00:00:59,189 --> 00:00:59,199
so look how can you oh you times t and
 

43
00:00:59,199 --> 00:00:59,990
so look how can you oh you times t and
minus one

44
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:00,000
minus one
 

45
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,709
minus one
yes so let's you need a two right okay

46
00:01:02,709 --> 00:01:02,719
yes so let's you need a two right okay
 

47
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,869
yes so let's you need a two right okay
let's try another number 26 to

48
00:01:04,869 --> 00:01:04,879
let's try another number 26 to
 

49
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,630
let's try another number 26 to
48 how many operations do you need

50
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:08,640
48 how many operations do you need
 

51
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,310
48 how many operations do you need
yeah 22 26

52
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:12,320
yeah 22 26
 

53
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,749
yeah 22 26
to 48 yeah minus two

54
00:01:15,749 --> 00:01:15,759
to 48 yeah minus two
 

55
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,789
to 48 yeah minus two
and times two where the minus one minus

56
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:18,799
and times two where the minus one minus
 

57
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,550
and times two where the minus one minus
one and then times two you need a three

58
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:20,560
one and then times two you need a three
 

59
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,149
one and then times two you need a three
operation yeah does it doesn't make

60
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:22,159
operation yeah does it doesn't make
 

61
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:22,789
operation yeah does it doesn't make
sense

62
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:22,799
sense
 

63
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,990
sense
oh yeah okay 26 minus

64
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:26,000
oh yeah okay 26 minus
 

65
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,550
oh yeah okay 26 minus
t equals 24 times we're done because you

66
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:28,560
t equals 24 times we're done because you
 

67
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,350
t equals 24 times we're done because you
can oh you can choose to minus one

68
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:31,360
can oh you can choose to minus one
 

69
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,069
can oh you can choose to minus one
and you need two and it becomes 24 and

70
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:34,079
and you need two and it becomes 24 and
 

71
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,830
and you need two and it becomes 24 and
the times two where down ryan you got it

72
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:35,840
the times two where down ryan you got it
 

73
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,469
the times two where down ryan you got it
yeah

74
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:36,479
yeah
 

75
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,109
yeah
yeah dude that's make sense yeah okay so

76
00:01:39,109 --> 00:01:39,119
yeah dude that's make sense yeah okay so
 

77
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,069
yeah dude that's make sense yeah okay so
given the number

78
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:40,079
given the number
 

79
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,510
given the number
star star and then can you write the

80
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:43,520
star star and then can you write the
 

81
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,550
star star and then can you write the
algorithm to

82
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:44,560
algorithm to
 

83
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,350
algorithm to
to tell me how the minimum number of

84
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:47,360
to tell me how the minimum number of
 

85
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,270
to tell me how the minimum number of
operations to in order to change from

86
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:49,280
operations to in order to change from
 

87
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,510
operations to in order to change from
the start to the end

88
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:51,520
the start to the end
 

89
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,630
the start to the end
or in any thoughts me show

90
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:54,640
or in any thoughts me show
 

91
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,469
or in any thoughts me show
how how can we solve this problem

92
00:01:58,469 --> 00:01:58,479
how how can we solve this problem
 

93
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,109
how how can we solve this problem
okay so can you tell me that if the

94
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:01,119
okay so can you tell me that if the
 

95
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:01,910
okay so can you tell me that if the
number the

96
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:01,920
number the
 

97
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,069
number the
target is smaller than the star will

98
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:04,079
target is smaller than the star will
 

99
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,109
target is smaller than the star will
happen

100
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:05,119
happen
 

101
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,550
happen
if like we want to convert from

102
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:08,560
if like we want to convert from
 

103
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,150
if like we want to convert from
10 to 5 so how can we do this

104
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:12,160
10 to 5 so how can we do this
 

105
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,990
10 to 5 so how can we do this
all we need to do is minus one

106
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:16,000
all we need to do is minus one
 

107
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,830
all we need to do is minus one
minus

108
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:19,840

 

109
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,550

what did i say about not doing that yeah

110
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:22,560
what did i say about not doing that yeah
 

111
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,470
what did i say about not doing that yeah
that's right even the target is smaller

112
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:24,480
that's right even the target is smaller
 

113
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:24,790
that's right even the target is smaller
than

114
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:24,800
than
 

115
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,460
than
uh

116
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:26,470
uh
 

117
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,990
uh
[Music]

118
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:28,000
[Music]
 

119
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,150
[Music]
we can't we can't do this yeah right

120
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,160
we can't we can't do this yeah right
 

121
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,430
we can't we can't do this yeah right
yeah okay

122
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:31,440
yeah okay
 

123
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,070
yeah okay
so i give you a hint what

124
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:36,080
so i give you a hint what
 

125
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,270
so i give you a hint what
i'll give you the hint

126
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:41,280

 

127
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,229

if the target is smaller than the star

128
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:44,239
if the target is smaller than the star
 

129
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:45,830
if the target is smaller than the star
we can only mine

130
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:45,840
we can only mine
 

131
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,309
we can only mine
minimum the difference might substrate

132
00:02:48,309 --> 00:02:48,319
minimum the difference might substrate
 

133
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,990
minimum the difference might substrate
the difference see this is

134
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:50,000
the difference see this is
 

135
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,110
the difference see this is
so trapped in this this makes it smaller

136
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:53,120
so trapped in this this makes it smaller
 

137
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,910
so trapped in this this makes it smaller
does make it

138
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:53,920
does make it
 

139
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,270
does make it
bigger that's right yes yay

140
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:57,280
bigger that's right yes yay
 

141
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,830
bigger that's right yes yay
okay so look if we want to convert 40

142
00:02:59,830 --> 00:02:59,840
okay so look if we want to convert 40
 

143
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,550
okay so look if we want to convert 40
from a

144
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:00,560
from a
 

145
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,149
from a
to 26

146
00:03:04,149 --> 00:03:04,159
to 26
 

147
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,910
to 26
it has 22 different yeah i know so look

148
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:07,920
it has 22 different yeah i know so look
 

149
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,589
it has 22 different yeah i know so look
if we consider the opposite if we if we

150
00:03:11,589 --> 00:03:11,599
if we consider the opposite if we if we
 

151
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,830
if we consider the opposite if we if we
converting the n to the star if we

152
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:13,840
converting the n to the star if we
 

153
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,149
converting the n to the star if we
reverse the direction

154
00:03:16,149 --> 00:03:16,159
reverse the direction
 

155
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,790
reverse the direction
if it's an even number if it's all

156
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:18,800
if it's an even number if it's all
 

157
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,470
if it's an even number if it's all
number

158
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:20,480
number
 

159
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,670
number
we subtract one right oh

160
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:23,680
we subtract one right oh
 

161
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,350
we subtract one right oh
yeah no no we add one or always

162
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:27,360
yeah no no we add one or always
 

163
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,830
yeah no no we add one or always
substitute one we add one

164
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:29,840
substitute one we add one
 

165
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,550
substitute one we add one
right because the opposite we add 1 to

166
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:32,560
right because the opposite we add 1 to
 

167
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,670
right because the opposite we add 1 to
10 and if it's

168
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:33,680
10 and if it's
 

169
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,990
10 and if it's
even number we what

170
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:38,000
even number we what
 

171
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,670
even number we what
we divided by 2. all right yeah

172
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:41,680
we divided by 2. all right yeah
 

173
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,869
we divided by 2. all right yeah
so 48 it's a even number so what do we

174
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:44,879
so 48 it's a even number so what do we
 

175
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,149
so 48 it's a even number so what do we
do we

176
00:03:46,149 --> 00:03:46,159
do we
 

177
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,350
do we
divided by two okay 24

178
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:49,360
divided by two okay 24
 

179
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,309
divided by two okay 24
look now 24 is smaller than 26 so what

180
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:52,319
look now 24 is smaller than 26 so what
 

181
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,910
look now 24 is smaller than 26 so what
should we do

182
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:53,920
should we do
 

183
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,190
should we do
add one that one but we don't need to

184
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:57,200
add one that one but we don't need to
 

185
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,429
add one that one but we don't need to
it's already smaller so we just

186
00:03:59,429 --> 00:03:59,439
it's already smaller so we just
 

187
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,509
it's already smaller so we just
calculate the difference right

188
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:01,519
calculate the difference right
 

189
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,229
calculate the difference right
yeah just add it that would be two all

190
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:04,239
yeah just add it that would be two all
 

191
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,990
yeah just add it that would be two all
right

192
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:06,000
right
 

193
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,110
right
yeah can we do this

194
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:09,120
yeah can we do this
 

195
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,429
yeah can we do this
does it make sense so we we reverse the

196
00:04:11,429 --> 00:04:11,439
does it make sense so we we reverse the
 

197
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,550
does it make sense so we we reverse the
operation we reverse the operation

198
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:14,560
operation we reverse the operation
 

199
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,590
operation we reverse the operation
define f star

200
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:17,600
define f star
 

201
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,870
define f star
s for star evo n okay

202
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:20,880
s for star evo n okay
 

203
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,870
s for star evo n okay
column if

204
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:24,880
column if
 

205
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,629
column if
n is smaller or equals

206
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:28,639
n is smaller or equals
 

207
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,950
n is smaller or equals
star what should we be ten

208
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:32,960
star what should we be ten
 

209
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,469
star what should we be ten
reason why if it's smaller yeah yeah

210
00:04:36,469 --> 00:04:36,479
reason why if it's smaller yeah yeah
 

211
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,590
reason why if it's smaller yeah yeah
for first 10 if we if we don't want to

212
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:39,600
for first 10 if we if we don't want to
 

213
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,830
for first 10 if we if we don't want to
convert into

214
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:40,840
convert into
 

215
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,510
convert into
five we want to start from ten

216
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:43,520
five we want to start from ten
 

217
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,030
five we want to start from ten
converting to five what's your favorite

218
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:45,040
converting to five what's your favorite
 

219
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,990
converting to five what's your favorite
we get

220
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:46,000
we get
 

221
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,990
we get
we just do s e minus s

222
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:50,000
we just do s e minus s
 

223
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,590
we just do s e minus s
s minus z yeah okay then

224
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:53,600
s minus z yeah okay then
 

225
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,870
s minus z yeah okay then
if e

226
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:56,880
if e
 

227
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,510
if e
is n1 what is mean and one what does it

228
00:04:59,510 --> 00:04:59,520
is n1 what is mean and one what does it
 

229
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,070
is n1 what is mean and one what does it
mean e

230
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,080
mean e
 

231
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,790
mean e
and one and one and one what does it

232
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:02,800
and one and one and one what does it
 

233
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,510
and one and one and one what does it
mean

234
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:05,520

 

235
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,270

is e and one what does it mean it's

236
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:09,280
is e and one what does it mean it's
 

237
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:15,590
is e and one what does it mean it's
all number or even a number uh even

238
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:15,600

 

239
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,870

oh yeah and one if it's one then it's

240
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:18,880
oh yeah and one if it's one then it's
 

241
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,550
oh yeah and one if it's one then it's
all number so this is

242
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:20,560
all number so this is
 

243
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,110
all number so this is
all number so if it's all number what

244
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:23,120
all number so if it's all number what
 

245
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,790
all number so if it's all number what
should we do

246
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:24,800
should we do
 

247
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,070
should we do
we should look look one

248
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:28,080
we should look look one
 

249
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,189
we should look look one
add one whether so return if we're doing

250
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:31,199
add one whether so return if we're doing
 

251
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,070
add one whether so return if we're doing
the recursive

252
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,080
the recursive
 

253
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:44,170
the recursive
one plus f

254
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:44,180

 

255
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,390

[Music]

256
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:46,400
[Music]
 

257
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,270
[Music]
yeah and if it's even number what should

258
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:49,280
yeah and if it's even number what should
 

259
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,189
yeah and if it's even number what should
we do

260
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:53,199
we do
 

261
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,230
we do
yeah so one plus f

262
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:56,240
yeah so one plus f
 

263
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,990
yeah so one plus f
s e divided by two divided by two

264
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,000
s e divided by two divided by two
 

265
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,309
s e divided by two divided by two
yeah so that that's the question so how

266
00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:02,319
yeah so that that's the question so how
 

267
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,990
yeah so that that's the question so how
many locations are there

268
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:04,000
many locations are there
 

269
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,070
many locations are there
how many locations are there can you

270
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,080
how many locations are there can you
 

271
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,909
how many locations are there can you
tell me

272
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:07,919
tell me
 

273
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,670
tell me
how many of the questions are i call in

274
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:09,680
how many of the questions are i call in
 

275
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,830
how many of the questions are i call in
itself okay how many are you cussing can

276
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:11,840
itself okay how many are you cussing can
 

277
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,790
itself okay how many are you cussing can
you tell me you haven't

278
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:12,800
you tell me you haven't
 

279
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,990
you tell me you haven't
seen yep you know one of

280
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:16,000
seen yep you know one of
 

281
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,270
seen yep you know one of
these how many questions two

282
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:19,280
these how many questions two
 

283
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,749
these how many questions two
two yeah yeah yeah yeah what's the time

284
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:21,759
two yeah yeah yeah yeah what's the time
 

285
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:22,950
two yeah yeah yeah yeah what's the time
complex

286
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:22,960
complex
 

287
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:28,469
complex
what's the term complexity

288
00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:28,479

 

289
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,830

it's hard yeah i win no because

290
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:31,840
it's hard yeah i win no because
 

291
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,070
it's hard yeah i win no because
every time we harven it haven't it and

292
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:34,080
every time we harven it haven't it and
 

293
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,550
every time we harven it haven't it and
then you feed this in the cage

294
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:36,560
then you feed this in the cage
 

295
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,670
then you feed this in the cage
oh look log n yeah roughly log n

296
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:39,680
oh look log n yeah roughly log n
 

297
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,029
oh look log n yeah roughly log n
lovely and again n is the

298
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:43,039
lovely and again n is the
 

299
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,270
lovely and again n is the
difference okay but if it's smaller then

300
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:45,280
difference okay but if it's smaller then
 

301
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,909
difference okay but if it's smaller then
we can directly return it that would be

302
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:47,919
we can directly return it that would be
 

303
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:49,110
we can directly return it that would be
01 right

304
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:49,120
01 right
 

305
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,790
01 right
but if if this number is always

306
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:52,800
but if if this number is always
 

307
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,230
but if if this number is always
right always bigger and then always the

308
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:56,240
right always bigger and then always the
 

309
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,350
right always bigger and then always the
even number then we can we can always

310
00:06:59,350 --> 00:06:59,360
even number then we can we can always
 

311
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,629
even number then we can we can always
divide by two right

312
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:00,639
divide by two right
 

313
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,070
divide by two right
okay so we can do this iterate not using

314
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:04,080
okay so we can do this iterate not using
 

315
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,110
okay so we can do this iterate not using
the recursion this

316
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:05,120
the recursion this
 

317
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,270
the recursion this
is like because in calling this function

318
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:07,280
is like because in calling this function
 

319
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,469
is like because in calling this function
itself but in

320
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:08,479
itself but in
 

321
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,230
itself but in
recursion the good advantage of

322
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:10,240
recursion the good advantage of
 

323
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,150
recursion the good advantage of
allocation is what

324
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:12,160
allocation is what
 

325
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,430
allocation is what
we can focus trying to solve one

326
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:15,440
we can focus trying to solve one
 

327
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,150
we can focus trying to solve one
pro situation at a time and then if this

328
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:18,160
pro situation at a time and then if this
 

329
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,270
pro situation at a time and then if this
is all number

330
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:19,280
is all number
 

331
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,870
is all number
we can turn it to as another sub

332
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:22,880
we can turn it to as another sub
 

333
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,350
we can turn it to as another sub
another problem right right calling

334
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:25,360
another problem right right calling
 

335
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,870
another problem right right calling
itself to solve it

336
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:26,880
itself to solve it
 

337
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,029
itself to solve it
yeah if it's all number if it's either

338
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:29,039
yeah if it's all number if it's either
 

339
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,230
yeah if it's all number if it's either
even number

340
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:30,240
even number
 

341
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,350
even number
until we know if e is smaller than x

342
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:33,360
until we know if e is smaller than x
 

343
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,830
until we know if e is smaller than x
because we already know if x minus e

344
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:35,840
because we already know if x minus e
 

345
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,870
because we already know if x minus e
right

346
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:36,880
right
 

347
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,629
right
yes okay so let's do it in

348
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:40,639
yes okay so let's do it in
 

349
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,990
yes okay so let's do it in
recursion so with the recur

350
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:44,000
recursion so with the recur
 

351
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,150
recursion so with the recur
not the normal equation sorry so we have

352
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:46,160
not the normal equation sorry so we have
 

353
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,909
not the normal equation sorry so we have
to define the answer answer at the

354
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:47,919
to define the answer answer at the
 

355
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,230
to define the answer answer at the
beginning equals one

356
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:50,240
beginning equals one
 

357
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,589
beginning equals one
z right okay so why

358
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:53,599
z right okay so why
 

359
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,790
z right okay so why
because while if the s

360
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:56,800
because while if the s
 

361
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,550
because while if the s
is smaller or equals n right

362
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:00,560
is smaller or equals n right
 

363
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,510
is smaller or equals n right
column is it smaller or equals like if

364
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:03,520
column is it smaller or equals like if
 

365
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,070
column is it smaller or equals like if
it's n

366
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:04,080
it's n
 

367
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,189
it's n
is smaller than uh when the star

368
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:07,199
is smaller than uh when the star
 

369
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,910
is smaller than uh when the star
is smaller than that

370
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:11,920
is smaller than that
 

371
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,189
is smaller than that

00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,070

okay so if if the star is smaller than

374
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:18,080
okay so if if the star is smaller than
 

375
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,390
okay so if if the star is smaller than

the
 

377
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,510
the

387
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,430

what one because if it's all number we

388
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:55,440
what one because if it's all number we
 

389
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,230
what one because if it's all number we
can only

390
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:56,240
can only
 

391
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,030
can only
add one right look look at every five to

392
00:08:59,030 --> 00:08:59,040
add one right look look at every five to
 

393
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,509
add one right look look at every five to
nine

nine
 

395
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,550
nine
else if n is all numbers yes

396
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:02,560
else if n is all numbers yes
 

397
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,910
else if n is all numbers yes
we add one yeah nine will become ten

398
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:05,920
we add one yeah nine will become ten
 

399
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,870
we add one yeah nine will become ten
right

400
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:06,880
right
 

401
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,070
right
yeah as it is

402
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:10,080
yeah as it is
 

403
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,190
yeah as it is
what's else here it's a it's

407
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,750

and divided by equals two and then we

408
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:19,760
and divided by equals two and then we
 

409
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,870
and divided by equals two and then we
have this

410
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:20,880
have this
 

411
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,430
have this
answer plus equals one because we

412
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:23,440
answer plus equals one because we
 

413
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:23,910
answer plus equals one because we
already

414
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:23,920
already
 

415
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,550
already
make one and then when this ends when

416
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:26,560
make one and then when this ends when
 

417
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,030
make one and then when this ends when
the

418
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:27,040
the
 

419
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,150
the
breaks uh what's the y loop why the y

420
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:30,160
breaks uh what's the y loop why the y
 

421
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:30,710
breaks uh what's the y loop why the y
loop

422
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:30,720
loop
 

423
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,910
loop
ends what does it mean it means that s

424
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:33,920
ends what does it mean it means that s
 

425
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,430
ends what does it mean it means that s
is bigger or equal than n right

426
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:37,440
is bigger or equal than n right
 

427
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,829
is bigger or equal than n right
yeah so return return

428
00:09:41,829 --> 00:09:41,839
yeah so return return
 

429
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,670
yeah so return return
also plus s

430
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:45,680
also plus s
 

431
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,310
also plus s
and here minus e s minus e whether yeah

432
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:50,320
and here minus e s minus e whether yeah
 

433
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,030
and here minus e s minus e whether yeah
all right because y is after the while

434
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:53,040
all right because y is after the while
 

435
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,150
all right because y is after the while
loop

436
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:54,160
loop
 

437
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,670
loop
this is s become bigger or equal than n

438
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:57,680
this is s become bigger or equal than n
 

439
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,670
this is s become bigger or equal than n
then we need to add the difference right

440
00:09:59,670 --> 00:09:59,680
then we need to add the difference right
 

441
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,030
then we need to add the difference right
look remember 26

442
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:01,040
look remember 26
 

443
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,710
look remember 26
to 1 48 right

444
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:04,720
to 1 48 right
 

445
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,230
to 1 48 right
all right so when this divide substitute

446
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:08,240
all right so when this divide substitute
 

447
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,269
all right so when this divide substitute
one is is 48 first of all you need to

448
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:11,279
one is is 48 first of all you need to
 

449
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,870
one is is 48 first of all you need to
divide it by

450
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:12,880
divide it by
 

451
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,430
divide it by
2 which is 24 right now the star is

452
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:15,440
2 which is 24 right now the star is
 

453
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,389
2 which is 24 right now the star is
bigger than the n

454
00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:16,399
bigger than the n
 

455
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,630
bigger than the n
right yeah what does it mean it takes

456
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:20,640
right yeah what does it mean it takes
 

457
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,990
right yeah what does it mean it takes
it takes 26 minus 24 two operations

458
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:26,000
it takes 26 minus 24 two operations
 

459
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,590
it takes 26 minus 24 two operations
to subtract 26 to 24 right

460
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:29,600
to subtract 26 to 24 right
 

461
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,829
to subtract 26 to 24 right
yeah that's what it means here s minus e

462
00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:31,839
yeah that's what it means here s minus e
 

463
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,389
yeah that's what it means here s minus e
is 26 minus 24 right

464
00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:34,399
is 26 minus 24 right
 

465
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,509
is 26 minus 24 right
the answer is one right so it is three

466
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:37,519
the answer is one right so it is three
 

467
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,750
the answer is one right so it is three
operations doesn't make sense

468
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:39,760
operations doesn't make sense
 

469
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,470
operations doesn't make sense
yeah does it make sense no does it make

470
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:42,480
yeah does it make sense no does it make
 

471
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,509
yeah does it make sense no does it make
sense

472
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:43,519
sense
 

473
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:53,990
sense
yeah okay what's this

474
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:54,000

 

475
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,389
