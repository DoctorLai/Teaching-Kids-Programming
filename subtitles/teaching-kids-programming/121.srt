1
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:05,620
[Applause]

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,990
[Music]

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,600
problem

4
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,960
the problem is that we have three binary

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,640
tree one

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,840
two three four and then we want to sum

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,480
the loot

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,199
to the leaves so which is one two four

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,400
plus one

10
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,760
three yeah all right which is 137.

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,200
so yesterday we were using the

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,239
preference search yeah a little bit

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,360
review okay

14
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,399
so we we we visit the travelers tree

15
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,559
even

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,600
in level by level order which is

17
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,239
breakfast search yeah

18
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,360
breast first search and then we use the

19
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,480
queue

20
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,399
all right to push the note

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,760
and every time i take a note i need to

22
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,520
push its kit

23
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,879
back to the queue right back to the

24
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,160
queue and then

25
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,760
when it's a leaf now here we accumulate

26
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,199
the answer with the common value all

27
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,080
right doesn't make sense

28
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,720
and we will push it to the kill we how

29
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,760
do we get

30
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:12,400
12 how how do we

31
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:15,759
push 12 or 124 174 into the

32
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,479
cube from 12 so it's 12 times 10 plus 4.

33
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,640
am i right

34
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:21,680
yeah yeah okay so now can you tell me

35
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,680
what's that research

36
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:28,880
you can then yeah as long as

37
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,720
far as you can as steep as you can

38
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,159
travel yeah for example like

39
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:38,159
this is now one two three

40
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:41,040
four and then five

41
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,040
six seven

42
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,840
what's the order of the death star

43
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,280
search one two three four five six seven

44
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,200
eight

45
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:55,040
yes one two three four five six seven

46
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,240
i want to go to the left as steep as i

47
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,520
can right

48
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,840
now and then i finish here and then i go

49
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,240
as deep as i can from the right okay

50
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,880
not including the route again not

51
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,960
including

52
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,959
because look it's a it's basically a

53
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:13,280
recursive function

54
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,280
okay so because function like

55
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,760
okay so what's that what's the worst

56
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:21,520
meaning so look

57
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,760
yeah look if loot is now this is the

58
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,440
basic framework about definition if

59
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,040
bluetooth is numb we return

60
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:31,120
right yeah yeah and then now

61
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,640
now i need to visit the current note

62
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,680
right okay all right

63
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,879
yeah yeah okay let's do it

64
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,440
loot okay visit and then then we need to

65
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,599
visit

66
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,800
the left tree so we should lose our left

67
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,840
all right

68
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:50,080
all right and then visit

69
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,519
the right tree all right okay yeah so

70
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,440
that's the

71
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,959
framework of the deaf research so how

72
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:59,360
can we apply this to solve this problem

73
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,720
first of all what should we do now so

74
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,360
it's basically the same but we need to

75
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,360
remember

76
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,280
the the value yeah we need to carry over

77
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,480
the value so how about if i

78
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:12,239
change this with a current value right

79
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:15,599
yeah kind of like look

80
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:18,879
if root is noun then we return

81
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:21,200
zero right obviously yeah definitely

82
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,080
okay now i don't need to revisit the

83
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,640
loot right

84
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,920
look remember i have lose here but now

85
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,599
look what

86
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:32,080
i need to i need to

87
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,879
change one line of code which is to

88
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,680
return

89
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,159
the current value when we are at leaf

90
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,680
right

91
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,760
so let leaf know how do we do the

92
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,799
difference how do we check if it's a

93
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,480
leaf now

94
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,840
come on how do we check if it's not it

95
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,040
doesn't have any parent

96
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,319
so if you tell me if do you have any

97
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,040
kids not parents if

98
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,040
lou don't what

99
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,959
left left is num right

100
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,080
and read the right is none yeah we're

101
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,280
done

102
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:06,319
it's not the same but just right left

103
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,319
is toronto okay so now look if let us do

104
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,519
this now and left of life is numb so

105
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:14,400
what should we do

106
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,400
we return we don't work

107
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,280
ah yeah this current is the previous but

108
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,400
now we have this neutral value so we

109
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:37,040
can't stand on that

110
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,040
right okay now look dfs

111
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,800
pfs blue top left yes

112
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,680
and then we don't no no no this kind of

113
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,919
value how hard you

114
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:50,479
put push it here and we need to return

115
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,000
this is a okay and then we say b equal

116
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:56,000
dfs

117
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,360
rule right and then do this

118
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,720
and then we return what because look

119
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:05,120
this is the sum of the left tree

120
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,720
left tree this is the sum of the right

121
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,199
three and the answer is

122
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,039
one answer is one can you feel this

123
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:14,160
plant

124
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:17,199
doesn't make sense or blank

125
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,479
blank okay so this is the sum of the

126
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,919
electric look everything

127
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:24,400
look yeah one two three

128
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,600
and then there's one so this a is the

129
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,720
left string which is this

130
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:32,800
this one two three and right b b

131
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,800
is the right trick so return one

132
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,240
reason why come on it's all very obvious

133
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,800
so this is a this is b

134
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,800
and one

135
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,320
go to the left if you want to go to the

136
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,560
left

137
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,520
then we currently we know this value

138
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,080
current value

139
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,039
so how do we pass current definitely

140
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,800
current

141
00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:04,479
current and what

142
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,479
we know value we are

143
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,840
right

144
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,880
right yeah because we are now adding

145
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,039
this

146
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,120
loot value yes we are adding this

147
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,000
bluetooth value but now the previous one

148
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,960
is current

149
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,680
current right look here suppose we are

150
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,759
here right

151
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,720
so the current value is what current

152
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,000
value is one

153
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,000
right and then the load value is two

154
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,120
and now we know if we want to move to

155
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,160
that three so

156
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:39,520
we should get 12 so it's current

157
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:42,000
this is current yeah times 10 is 10 plus

158
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,160
root of value yeah this is the lunar now

159
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,720
it's 2 so 10 plus 2 12

160
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,199
and then you'll go to the next line okay

161
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,639
that makes sense

162
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,000
so let's look with the little

163
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,840
modification we change we are

164
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,919
successfully changing this the

165
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,840
default search template to solve this

166
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,680
problem right therefore search

167
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,120
what's the current thing can you explain

168
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,199
to me what's the second parameter

169
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,479
current

170
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,720
current um what is it what why

171
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,479
what's this what's this what's this

172
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,400
parameter why are we

173
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:15,199
why why do we need to pass this

174
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,199
parameter current

175
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,039
yeah what does it mean this current so

176
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,560
look this current thing what does it

177
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:24,000
mean

178
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,840
it means that the lower

179
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,599
what are we doing here why we need to

180
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,639
pass the current times 10 plus

181
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:35,840
the what's this

182
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,840
uh it is it's what

183
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:44,720
what's the current it's it's 90 times

184
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,720
it's look if we are here at three what's

185
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,319
the current value

186
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:52,479
oh one weight what's that what if we

187
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:59,840
if we we are loot and if this is the

188
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:59,840
root now and what's the current value

189
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,879
a little bit yeah

190
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,080
leaf seven why is it seven no that's not

191
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,680
seven come on

192
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:20,319
one it only will be one five twelve

193
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,280
one two two three which number pick one

194
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,520
two

195
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:27,840
yeah twelve okay another one if the root

196
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,840
is here what's the current value

197
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,039
one four five one hundred forty five

198
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,120
okay if like

199
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,760
look if the load is here what's the

200
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,880
current value

201
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,880
if you don't know that is here what's

202
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,680
the current value is

203
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,640
14. yeah we're done so you know what's

204
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,800
color value yeah it's the value

205
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,880
let the previous from the root to the

206
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,200
node before to its parent

207
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,880
right now we need to pass this value how

208
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,279
do we pass this value we just times

209
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,640
these

210
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:05,600
10 we pass we times this 14 10 and then

211
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,160
plus this fight will be 145 right am

212
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,240
right

213
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:14,080
yeah what's the time complexity oh n

214
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,040
what's the n the number of nodes in the

215
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,320
binary tree

216
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,320
okay what's the space complex

217
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,800
because we are using the recursion the

218
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,000
question has the

219
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:29,040
complexity effects use of

220
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,640
stat you know navigation users do you

221
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,000
understand yeah yeah

222
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,920
okay so uh let up that will be it yeah

223
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,880
we're done today good job so

224
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:41,120
quick yeah yeah good job say bye bye bye

225
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:44,000
bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye you want

226
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,000
to make it 10 minutes

227
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
so take a look okay i'm going to erase

228
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:56,240
this you know easily what's this

229
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,560
x b okay you actually you don't need to

230
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,839
assign to a plus b you can just return

231
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,880
these

232
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:05,839
return leads plus plus this okay doesn't

233
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,839
make sense
