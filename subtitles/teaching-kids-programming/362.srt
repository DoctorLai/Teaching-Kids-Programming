1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:06,000
hello mr mr ryan all right

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,880
okay so

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,080
we have a rod or rose or whatever a

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,840
stick yeah

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,080
yeah

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,320
basically the straight thing and we know

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,400
the length which is n this is the

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,439
integer positive integer

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,520
right

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,039
so we want to cut it

11
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,199
yeah we know

12
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,039
we want to cut it and sell it yeah we

13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,640
want to cut it and say so

14
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:32,399
for example like if we have these

15
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,920
you know we have all these array prices

16
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,200
array okay

17
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,760
which is one three five

18
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,280
seven seven right let's see

19
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,440
okay so it means that if we kind of grow

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:49,120
it in colorado okay let's try a lot if

21
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,719
color rot with size one we can sell it

22
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,079
at one dollar

23
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,760
size two

24
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,719
three dollars five three five dollars

25
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,359
okay

26
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,120
okay so look this is i right so

27
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,960
basically price i

28
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,920
price i

29
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,520
means that we can sell the size with

30
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,360
size

31
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,479
i plus one right why is that parasol

32
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,560
because i is the index the first element

33
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:18,000
is zero okay

34
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,159
so if the n equals six right

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,759
if n equals six

36
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,960
how can we

37
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,400
cut the rod so that we sell the maximum

38
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,640
profit

39
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,920
so for example six i can cut it with one

40
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,400
plus five

41
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,840
right so in this case i will have i will

42
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,840
say what one plus

43
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,040
seven yeah

44
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,920
yeah okay that's

45
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,520
size one two three four five so one plus

46
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,320
seven

47
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,680
right

48
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,600
so that's eight

49
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:55,200
but if i cut it into three plus three

50
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:58,479
so one two three here so i could set it

51
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,360
with ten so this is bigger right or i

52
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,320
can cut it with two plus

53
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,560
four

54
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,399
so i could set it with

55
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,360
two plus five

56
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,440
uh

57
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,000
two plus four six and equal six so i

58
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,280
would say with three dollars for

59
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,720
for the size two three and four

60
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,840
for the six

61
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,840
so that would be two plus

62
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:29,280
so that could only be six

63
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:31,440
why is the complete on six could only be

64
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,720
do you get this problem

65
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,720
no no not really okay

66
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,959
sorry you get it kind of okay so look if

67
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,840
we said it was that if n equals six then

68
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,879
we can

69
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,519
split into two and four two for two

70
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,519
would be three dollars for four would be

71
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,640
seven dollars so

72
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:56,319
three plus seven is also ten right

73
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,319
any other options like

74
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,840
one five

75
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,519
three three two two four okay this is

76
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,599
only option right

77
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,599
okay

78
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,959
makes sense

79
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,480
so

80
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,760
how

81
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,920
so

82
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,239
what's your approach of doing this

83
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,280
what's your approach think about it

84
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,239
um

85
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,680
okay so you just see that price and

86
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,000
write

87
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,000
uh

88
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,159
everything up to the end that's right

89
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,799
yes and then like one two three four

90
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,799
five and

91
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:44,930
[Music]

92
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,360
again

93
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,920
five is seven well i know so we try

94
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,080
every possibility there we see look this

95
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,760
is the integer so we we we talked about

96
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,480
let's play how to split the integer

97
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,200
before right so if we have this as n

98
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,599
which is integer

99
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,519
we can spread this and right we can use

100
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,400
the default search preferences right

101
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,439
yeah

102
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:12,000
to do it so we can try with one okay so

103
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:14,640
one i split it to one i calculate this

104
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,479
so we have this function differential

105
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,680
with this current

106
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:21,759
uh what we with the remaining we know we

107
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,000
remember n right and then with this

108
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,560
current profit

109
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,960
right with the current profit

110
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,199
and what else do we need

111
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,040
and we can just look it up right so

112
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,040
let's just quickly write the suitable

113
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,320
for the different search and then

114
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,360
yeah

115
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,840
so look

116
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,840
so look

117
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,160
uh actually definitely says n right so

118
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,120
we don't probably not normally uh don't

119
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,160
need the left profit thing define

120
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,199
okay

121
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,800
okay

122
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,720
so

123
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,440
we want to find out

124
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,960
what the maximum right so we will have a

125
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,120
maximum

126
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,639
maximum perfect here right so let's say

127
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,000
maximum profit

128
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:08,320
at the beginning is zero right yeah

129
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,880
maximum perfect now we can look at this

130
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,280
we want to find out this n

131
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,919
we want to cut this n right cut this end

132
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,240
so we can try every possibility so at

133
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,880
the beginning for i

134
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,759
in range

135
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,000
right

136
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,919
for this end i can cut it or not tactic

137
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,720
right all right

138
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:31,199
yeah

139
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,199
so for this i i i range let's say

140
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,360
let's say what

141
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,400
so i want to try look for this n i can

142
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,960
try with up to n plus one right

143
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,199
up up to n plus one

144
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,199
yeah

145
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,800
and then i can cut it

146
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,800
uh hold on cut it

147
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:57,360
d f s i

148
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,520
right we can give us i

149
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:03,199
uh actually no dfs n minus i n minus i

150
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,720
plus

151
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:10,240
twice so now i can have this price i for

152
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:13,280
i right where is i but n minus i minus

153
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,400
one right because i start from zero

154
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,639
right

155
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,639
yeah

156
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,199
yeah make sense

157
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:24,880
now i have this answer will be at the

158
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:28,240
beginning of the match dot infinity

159
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:30,319
and then this answer will be the mean of

160
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,720
this answer

161
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:36,000
and then this week right and i just need

162
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:38,880
to write return answer all right

163
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,960
okay so now here i need to check if n is

164
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,800
smaller or equal than zero return zero

165
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,280
right

166
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:49,720
right yeah

167
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,720
so what's the problem with this one

168
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,759
why is it

169
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,880
actually

170
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:59,120
because and price price is uh

171
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,880
the okay so this index starts from zero

172
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,680
to 10 minus one

173
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:06,080
so but the the actual size it represent

174
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,840
is one to n right so it needs to plus

175
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,160
one so this is n

176
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,599
and that needs to m minus i minus the

177
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,479
price i right

178
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,479
right look

179
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:21,120
yeah so look look

180
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:24,479
i try every possibility for for i

181
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,960
currently the rod size is n right so the

182
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:29,919
log size is n how many possibilities of

183
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,599
cutting this i have this for example n

184
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:35,280
equals three how many possibilities of

185
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,280
cutting three and equals

186
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,199
zero one two three

187
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,039
how many possibilities six

188
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:56,000
the n equals three by n equals three

189
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:59,280
the size they are three how many how

190
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,280
many ways of cutting it

191
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:05,680
i can cut is one to two right or i can

192
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,680
cut it in two to one

193
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,720
or i can cut it with zero

194
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:15,280
sorry yeah is it sweet

195
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:19,199
so look i cut three ways cut it

196
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,199
if i don't cut it if i don't cut it

197
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:29,199
okay so look if n equals 3 here i is

198
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:33,519
from zero to two right i is from zero to

199
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:36,640
two so price will be from zero to two

200
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:39,440
oh okay yeah if i don't cut it actually

201
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:42,640
if we if i don't cut it the size will be

202
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:45,519
remaining the three right right okay

203
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:49,200
if i equals two

204
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:51,760
uh if i equals to two then n minus two

205
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,560
minus one okay so then i the remaining

206
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,800
would be n minus three x okay that makes

207
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,279
sense make sense

208
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,920
okay so look

209
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,600
what's this look i have a a rod with

210
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,720
size n

211
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,320
right

212
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:11,120
yeah yeah yeah this is basic so i try i

213
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,120
can try cutting with the

214
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,320
one cutting with two cutting with three

215
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,959
look if i cut it with i right

216
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:23,040
with cutting with the size i

217
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:24,080
okay look if i cutting with the size

218
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,760
um

219
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:30,640
size i actually is i i plus one the size

220
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,720
here is i plus one okay

221
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,120
okay so what's what's here what's

222
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,399
remaining here if this is i plus 1

223
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,760
what's here

224
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:42,959
the whole the whole thing is n

225
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,920
if this is i plus and what's here

226
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,640
n

227
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,160
minus i plus 1

228
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,959
plus

229
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,160
i

230
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,959
minus i

231
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,399
what

232
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,600
this is i plus one n minus i

233
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,399
minus one

234
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,880
minus one right so this speed is smaller

235
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:05,279
okay so if i cut if i want to keep a

236
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,839
size with i plus one so this bit i can

237
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:10,640
get a profit of what

238
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,600
price price i right yeah this is known

239
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,279
right

240
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,440
yeah okay

241
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,839
this speed is known yeah

242
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,440
and what's the what's the speed what's

243
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,600
this bit what's the price for getting

244
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,600
there

245
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:27,440
n minus i minus all right this is the

246
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,440
size

247
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,399
so but we we are not sure how many cuts

248
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,399
for this right so then we can call this

249
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,560
step from a different

250
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,720
dfs function to solve the problem with

251
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,120
the smaller size right

252
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,640
yeah so that's what this part is about

253
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,800
you see

254
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,920
yeah and then i i can do this with

255
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,680
answers and compare with get the minimum

256
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,079
okay what's what's the problem of this

257
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,480
approach definitely

258
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,480
okay if i tell you that

259
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,640
if i tell you that there's an easy way

260
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,399
to make a default search the proof of

261
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,720
thing deficit

262
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,920
into a dynamic programming

263
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,320
and

264
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,399
you have used this before so what will

265
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,240
it be

266
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,640
if i tell you an easy way there's an

267
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,160
easy way between this approach if i edit

268
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,519
something here that will be become a

269
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,519
top-down directory programming

270
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,680
what's the problem of this theory it

271
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,320
will be explaination because we

272
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:29,160
calculated yeah yeah we're going to put

273
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,160
a cache here right oh yeah oh yeah

274
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,069
[Music]

275
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,000
sorry nothing

276
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,000
uh

277
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,920
[Music]

278
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,560
what's the what's the why

279
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,720
what's this bit

280
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:58,399
we speak therefore search n minus i

281
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:01,519
minus one what's the can you expensive

282
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:04,800
okay so we know this is i

283
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:07,680
i mean i plus one and we can track it

284
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:11,000
and this is n minus i minus one but it

285
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,000
hasn't been

286
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:17,200
okay so you kind of yeah i understand

287
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,200
right now but yeah okay so

288
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,440
so we are trying every possibility for

289
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,079
this size and yeah we can try you know

290
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,720
keep a size with the keep a fixed size

291
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:28,560
right we only sell the size first part

292
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,399
of this yeah and then i get the profit

293
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,560
prices i right

294
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,320
and then when i cut a color size keep

295
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,760
the size i plus one and i have the

296
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,279
remaining size

297
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,360
so then i can call this function

298
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,959
recursive recovery function

299
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,480
deficit here

300
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:46,880
to find out to compute

301
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,440
the profit i can make

302
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,519
the profit i can make by

303
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,399
cutting you know at this point we are

304
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,040
not sure

305
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:57,279
the best of optimum way of cutting that

306
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,959
it would be no cut all there will be

307
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,360
many cuts but we don't know but we call

308
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,320
this function to recursively find it out

309
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,440
right

310
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,320
yeah

311
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,079
look this answer at the beginning is max

312
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,480
infinity and we're getting the minimum

313
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:12,560
we compare the minimum right and this is

314
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,959
this part is for i i already made the

315
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,040
decision i so this part i make the

316
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,560
decision so every time i make a little

317
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,519
decision right

318
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,680
look this this whole whole rod

319
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,120
i don't know how many cards i want right

320
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,440
that would be too complicated to

321
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,000
consider all these right but what should

322
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,600
i do now i can try okay let's make a

323
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,480
little

324
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,720
little decision what is that i can make

325
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,760
a decision okay i can cut the size with

326
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,920
one

327
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,920
yeah i can keep a size with one i can

328
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,839
keep the size with two i can keep a size

329
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,480
with three right

330
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,880
so i can keep size with this eye

331
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,680
and once i keep a size with i then i

332
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,399
know

333
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:56,160
the profit i made from from from cutting

334
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:58,800
this bit right right yeah

335
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,639
and then i i can keep doing this right

336
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,720
make sense

337
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:05,199
at least is explanation without the cash

338
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:09,360
right remember the difference that dfsn

339
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:10,560
is the maximum profit if we can

340
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:15,040
share

341
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:17,920
the rope with the size n right

342
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:20,880
and then i'm iterating all possibilities

343
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,399
of cutting the size n with the first cup

344
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,279
i

345
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:27,680
with the first cut i when i first

346
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:31,600
cut the size with the first i

347
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,720
i have remaining n minus i minus 1

348
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,800
right

349
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,639
and then i look this is a smaller size

350
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,839
with n at least it's smaller than n

351
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,880
right

352
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,880
you see

353
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,639
if this is smaller with n and i can

354
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,959
recursively calling me something to

355
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,920
solve a smaller problem

356
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,240
right

357
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:51,199
eventually i can look i need to produce

358
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,920
if n is smaller than zero if n

359
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:56,800
if n is zero the base cases

360
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:59,680
right too noisy if the n is zero means

361
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:02,720
that the size is zero what's that i can

362
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:04,720
sell empty i can sell air what

363
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,560
for nothing so what's the price of

364
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,279
selling nothing

365
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,360
right we're done zero

366
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:14,079
right okay

367
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,160
what do we call this dynamic programming

368
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,120
what kind of dynamic programming is this

369
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,519
top down

370
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,399
top down yeah is it total

371
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,920
yes

372
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,120
okay this is the top-down anime

373
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,600
programming so

374
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,120
uh so tomorrow we'll talk about butter

375
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,160
up okay

376
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,680
yeah and

377
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,720
what's the time from next year space

378
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,029
complexity

379
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,029
[Music]

380
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:40,720
let's look at their n

381
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,600
n right but for each one i have to do

382
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,920
this

383
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,680
one square yeah one square but the space

384
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,040
complexity

385
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,279
i want

386
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:52,320
i have a cache why is there one what's

387
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,320
the space from recipe

388
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,800
every ryan

389
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:59,120
anyone one final answer what's the specs

390
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,160
from let's see look at that n i put a

391
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,399
cache

392
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,519
how many states i need to store need to

393
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,880
catch

394
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,120
two

395
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,600
two or two

396
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,920
look at this n if n is a hundred how

397
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:15,680
many how many values of dfs and i need

398
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:18,480
to stop yeah one hundred and what's that

399
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,480
oh and yes we are done

400
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,959
yeah i know and look at that but the

401
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,279
space is the time is o n square why is

402
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,160
that for each end i need to iterate with

403
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,560
that

404
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,839
with n right got it

405
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:33,880
okay

406
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,880
okay that's it for today bye
