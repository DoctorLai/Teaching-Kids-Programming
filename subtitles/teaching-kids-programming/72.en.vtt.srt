75
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,630

you can you can have characters

76
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:24,640
you can you can have characters
 

77
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,990
you can you can have characters
mapped to integers okay so 32 is a space

78
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:28,000
mapped to integers okay so 32 is a space
 

79
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,270
mapped to integers okay so 32 is a space
and then 65 is

80
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:31,280
and then 65 is
 

81
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,309
and then 65 is
a letter a y

82
00:02:34,309 --> 00:02:34,319
a letter a y
 

83
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,229
a letter a y
i mean it's just the way it defines and

84
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:36,239
i mean it's just the way it defines and
 

85
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,350
i mean it's just the way it defines and
i know too many

86
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:37,360
i know too many
 

87
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,390
i know too many
okay okay a and then b will be 66 yeah

88
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:40,400
okay okay a and then b will be 66 yeah
 

89
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,670
okay okay a and then b will be 66 yeah
you go on

90
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:41,680
you go on
 

91
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,270
you go on
and then another thing is that 97

92
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:45,280
and then another thing is that 97
 

93
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:51,990
and then another thing is that 97
is the smaller case a yeah 90 a uvp

94
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,000

 

95
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,110

and number 0 would be 48

96
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:55,120
and number 0 would be 48
 

97
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,550
and number 0 would be 48
one will be 49 okay so

98
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:58,560
one will be 49 okay so
 

99
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,670
one will be 49 okay so
so from from 1 to 127

100
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:03,680
so from from 1 to 127
 

101
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,270
so from from 1 to 127
from 1 to 30 it can be divided into

102
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:07,280
from 1 to 30 it can be divided into
 

103
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,430
from 1 to 30 it can be divided into
1 to 31 these are

104
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:11,440

 

105
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,869

non-printable non-printable so it means

106
00:03:14,869 --> 00:03:14,879
non-printable non-printable so it means
 

107
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:15,589
non-printable non-printable so it means
that

108
00:03:15,589 --> 00:03:15,599
that
 

109
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,630
that
you know maybe uh 30

110
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:18,640
you know maybe uh 30
 

111
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,869
you know maybe uh 30
13 is a carriage return so it's a

112
00:03:20,869 --> 00:03:20,879
13 is a carriage return so it's a
 

113
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:21,750
13 is a carriage return so it's a

117
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,509

like
 

121
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,149
like
abc numbers uh lowercase uppercase and

122
00:03:34,149 --> 00:03:34,159
abc numbers uh lowercase uppercase and
 

123
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,589

uh
some symbols you know exclamation mark

126
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:38,080
some symbols you know exclamation mark
 

127
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,990
some symbols you know exclamation mark
question mark this is like within this

128
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:40,000
question mark this is like within this
 

129
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,630
question mark this is like within this
range

130
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:40,640
range
 

131
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,869
range
and then there's a 127. it's a thing

132
00:03:42,869 --> 00:03:42,879
and then there's a 127. it's a thing
 

133
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,550
and then there's a 127. it's a thing
punctuation okay

00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:44,560
punctuation okay
 

135
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,990

okay so so in python you can do this

136
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:48,000
okay so so in python you can do this
 

137
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,550
okay so so in python you can do this
look

138
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:48,560
look
 

139
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,229
look
in python if you write chr

140
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:52,239
in python if you write chr
 

141
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:58,149
in python if you write chr
65 okay so what does it give you sure

142
00:03:58,149 --> 00:03:58,159

 

143
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,990

you'll give me a yeah why

144
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:02,000
you'll give me a yeah why
 

145
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,149
you'll give me a yeah why
this is asking okay

147
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,190

and then chr 97

148
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:09,200
and then chr 97
 

149
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,990
and then chr 97
do you steal the number okay yeah we're

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,349
down wait
what 48 what even that means

154
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:19,359
what 48 what even that means
 

155
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,749
what 48 what even that means
it's just mapping it's just that this is

156
00:04:21,749 --> 00:04:21,759
it's just mapping it's just that this is

so if you already give a number a

174
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:46,400
so if you already give a number a
 

175
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,510
so if you already give a number a
what does it give 65 yes yes that's the

176
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:49,520
what does it give 65 yes yes that's the
 

177
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,710
what does it give 65 yes yes that's the
other way so it's the reverse

178
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:52,720
other way so it's the reverse
 

179
00:04:52,720 --> 00:05:07,450
other way so it's the reverse
smaller case a 97

180
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:07,460

 

181
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:12,550

[Music]

182
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:12,560

 

183
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,670

okay 49 okay

184
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:15,680
okay 49 okay
 

185
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,710
okay 49 okay
so this is the way to do it so

186
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:18,720
so this is the way to do it so
 

187
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,150
so this is the way to do it so
how about look

188
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:22,160
how about look
 

189
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,670
how about look
in python yeah look a

190
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:25,680
in python yeah look a
 

191
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,189
in python yeah look a
is like top dot upper

192
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:29,199
is like top dot upper
 

193
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,790
is like top dot upper
upper this will give me a yeah

194
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:32,800
upper this will give me a yeah
 

195
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,590
upper this will give me a yeah
and then a stop

196
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:37,600
and then a stop
 

197
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,629
and then a stop
i don't give me lower lowercase a

198
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:40,639
i don't give me lower lowercase a
 

199
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,270
i don't give me lower lowercase a
okay so can you implement these two i

200
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:43,280
okay so can you implement these two i
 

201
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,469
okay so can you implement these two i
mean

202
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:44,479
mean
 

203
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,310
mean
like like look like

204
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:48,320
like like look like
 

205
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,390
like like look like
define lower okay let's just give one

206
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:52,400
define lower okay let's just give one
 

207
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,909
define lower okay let's just give one
example lower a

208
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:53,919
example lower a
 

209
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,510
example lower a
okay lower eight no no big a okay

210
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:57,520
okay lower eight no no big a okay
 

211
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,230
okay lower eight no no big a okay
so now we know we want to change we want

212
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:00,240
so now we know we want to change we want
 

213
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,029
so now we know we want to change we want
to check this

214
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:01,039
to check this
 

215
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,550
to check this
right look we can do this look

216
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:04,560
right look we can do this look
 

217
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:13,270
right look we can do this look
that

218
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:13,280

 

219
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,629

we get the number a right right

220
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:16,639
we get the number a right right
 

221
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:23,510
we get the number a right right
if it is is this ascii

222
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:23,520

 

223
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,309

or maybe maybe maybe we can just do this

224
00:06:26,309 --> 00:06:26,319
or maybe maybe maybe we can just do this
 

225
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:26,710
or maybe maybe maybe we can just do this
if

226
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:26,720
if
 

227
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,870
if
a is bigger than or equal

228
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:30,880
a is bigger than or equal
 

229
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,990
a is bigger than or equal
a right and a

230
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:34,000
a right and a
 

231
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,950
a right and a
is smaller equals z so if it's basically

232
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:36,960
is smaller equals z so if it's basically
 

233
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,590
is smaller equals z so if it's basically
what it means

234
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:37,600
what it means
 

235
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,430
what it means
if if this is the uppercase letter right

236
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:41,440
if if this is the uppercase letter right
 

237
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,070
if if this is the uppercase letter right
right yeah now we need to return smaller

238
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,080
right yeah now we need to return smaller
 

239
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,550
right yeah now we need to return smaller
case

240
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:44,560
case
 

241
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:51,830
case
so

242
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:51,840

 

243
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,629

now this is asking 65 and you need to

244
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:54,639
now this is asking 65 and you need to
 

245
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,749
now this is asking 65 and you need to
add 32 right

246
00:06:57,749 --> 00:06:57,759
add 32 right
 

247
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,390
add 32 right
let us okay plus what plus yes how's the

248
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:00,400
let us okay plus what plus yes how's the
 

249
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,990
let us okay plus what plus yes how's the
number here seven

250
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:02,000
number here seven
 

251
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,469
number here seven
and we can otherwise i just just written

252
00:07:04,469 --> 00:07:04,479
and we can otherwise i just just written
 

253
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:05,430
and we can otherwise i just just written
eight

254
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:05,440
eight
 

255
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,469
eight
if we look at this one if it's uppercase

256
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:08,479
if we look at this one if it's uppercase
 

257
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:09,110
if we look at this one if it's uppercase
letter

258
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:09,120
letter
 

259
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,550
letter
yeah uppercase is better yeah zero

260
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:12,560
yeah uppercase is better yeah zero
 

261
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,670
yeah uppercase is better yeah zero
asking is this math look 65 is a and

262
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:15,680
asking is this math look 65 is a and
 

263
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,550
asking is this math look 65 is a and
then

264
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:16,560
then
 

265
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,390
then
i need to what was the a this is what

266
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:20,400
i need to what was the a this is what
 

267
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,390
i need to what was the a this is what
97 yeah so i want to make 65 to 97 so i

268
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:24,400
97 yeah so i want to make 65 to 97 so i
 

269
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,029
97 yeah so i want to make 65 to 97 so i
need to plus

270
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:25,039
need to plus
 

271
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,150
need to plus
one 32 yeah this is what it does do you

272
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:28,160
one 32 yeah this is what it does do you
 

273
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:41,909
one 32 yeah this is what it does do you
get it

274
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:41,919

 

275
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,029

this letter is between a and z so it's

276
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:45,039
this letter is between a and z so it's
 

277
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,189
this letter is between a and z so it's
an uppercase letter and then i get this

278
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:47,199
an uppercase letter and then i get this
 

279
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,230
an uppercase letter and then i get this
asking mark

280
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:48,240
asking mark
 

281
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,029
asking mark
as you called plus 32 then you make it

282
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:51,039
as you called plus 32 then you make it
 

283
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,309
as you called plus 32 then you make it
lower case

284
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:52,319
lower case
 

285
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,230
lower case
and then return it and how about if i

286
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:54,240
and then return it and how about if i
 

287
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,990
and then return it and how about if i
want to make it upper

288
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:56,000
want to make it upper
 

289
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,430
want to make it upper
so given the number given the character

290
00:07:59,430 --> 00:07:59,440
so given the number given the character
 

291
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,950
so given the number given the character
if it's small it's it's a longer path

292
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:02,960
if it's small it's it's a longer path
 

293
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,909
if it's small it's it's a longer path
look if it's the lowercase yeah and then

294
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:05,919
look if it's the lowercase yeah and then
 

295
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,150
look if it's the lowercase yeah and then
what's your letter here

296
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:08,160
what's your letter here
 

297
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,390
what's your letter here
eric what should i do here if it's the

298
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:10,400
eric what should i do here if it's the
 

299
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,390
eric what should i do here if it's the
lowercase 97 and i want to make it

300
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:12,400
lowercase 97 and i want to make it
 

301
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,990
lowercase 97 and i want to make it
uppercase so what should i do

302
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:14,000
uppercase so what should i do
 

303
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,909
uppercase so what should i do
30 minus 32 yeah

304
00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:17,919
30 minus 32 yeah
 

305
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,749
30 minus 32 yeah
okay that's it so what's the

306
00:08:21,749 --> 00:08:21,759
okay that's it so what's the
 

307
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,710
okay that's it so what's the
um complexity no there's no complexity

308
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:24,720
um complexity no there's no complexity
 

309
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,869
um complexity no there's no complexity
it's just a one or one you just

310
00:08:26,869 --> 00:08:26,879
it's just a one or one you just
 

311
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:33,750
it's just a one or one you just
look it look it up it's all one so

312
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:33,760

 

313
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,829

not return return carriage return you

not return return carriage return you
have character return is 13

316
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:37,519
have character return is 13
 

317
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,269
have character return is 13
okay that's a space space 32

318
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:41,279
okay that's a space space 32
 

319
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,430
okay that's a space space 32
okay yeah okay and

320
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:45,440

 

321
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,030

tv is 126

322
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:49,040
tv is 126
 

323
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,310
tv is 126
and 127 maybe i

324
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:52,320
and 127 maybe i
 

325
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,829
and 127 maybe i
may forgot and a eight is

326
00:08:55,829 --> 00:08:55,839
may forgot and a eight is
 

327
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,630
may forgot and a eight is
is backspace backspace so you know the

328
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:58,640
is backspace backspace so you know the
 

329
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,269
is backspace backspace so you know the
backspace

330
00:08:59,269 --> 00:08:59,279
backspace
 

331
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,550
backspace
yes yeah so this is asking ascii code so

332
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:02,560
yes yeah so this is asking ascii code so
 

333
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,470
yes yeah so this is asking ascii code so
it's basically the whole computer sees

334
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:04,480
it's basically the whole computer sees
 

335
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,990
it's basically the whole computer sees
the characters

336
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:06,000
the characters
 

337
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,710
the characters
