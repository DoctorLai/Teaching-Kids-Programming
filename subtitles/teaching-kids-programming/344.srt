1
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,720
okay so we're given a list of numbers

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,200
and we want to find out how many numbers

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:14,920
have this odd number of digits okay so

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:18,000
for example like 1 2 4

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:20,960
32 four

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,920
one how many numbers three

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,880
what are those one one two four and four

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,760
and one

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:30,960
one big brain quick match okay so these

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,960
are just quick rounds

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,079
so yes we need to go through these

12
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,600
numbers right and then we can check if

13
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,039
we need to come up with a function to

14
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,200
check if each number is uh

15
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,320
is odd number of digits okay let's just

16
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,559
write these

17
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,399
let's just assume these these function

18
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,199
function you know we're going to fill

19
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:57,440
the data up i given the number n right

20
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,079
and you need to tell me if it's true

21
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,359
two if it's uh number digi if false if

22
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,760
it's even number of digits okay

23
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,760
otherwise so let's just put the path

24
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,000
here pause means that okay we're going

25
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,799
to come back to that later okay pass

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,560
okay

27
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,760
and now we need our answer yeah answer

28
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,520
equals zero

29
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,119
this number for i

30
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,640
in nouns

31
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,799
and we can just say

32
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,600
if of

33
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,080
i

34
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,240
then we can increment it right yeah and

35
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,799
then answer yeah

36
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,600
okay this is easier this bit of time

37
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,320
contact stays what

38
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,640
oh very easy and then let's say

39
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,640
we are not sure what's the

40
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,000
time complexity to implement this odd

41
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,200
okay

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,079
um by the way this one we can do it in a

43
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,320
prettier in one line thing

44
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:48,640
return we can just return

45
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,520
okay or

46
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,280
i

47
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,399
for i

48
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,720
in

49
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,719
lambs

50
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,119
then this will give me a list of two and

51
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:02,719
four right a list of two and four

52
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:05,200
which uh if it's a odd number of digits

53
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:07,600
or four and we just need to count

54
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,479
as a term array.count count function

55
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:13,200
call how many of them count two okay

56
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,680
so these one two three four five is

57
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:19,280
equal to the same line return

58
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,560
at least a list of o i for i in numbers

59
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,520
country okay

60
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,520
yeah

61
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:27,120
okay now now let's focus on how to

62
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,120
implement this odd function okay okay

63
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,200
so how many ways can you think of the

64
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,720
most easy way to

65
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,480
to to count a a number to find out if a

66
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,840
number integer

67
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,200
in the type is uh has the odd number of

68
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,080
digits

69
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,280
we can do what you can mold the rest

70
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,239
we can

71
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,200
how

72
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,920
usually how do we get the length of a

73
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,959
string yeah we can just look at it yeah

74
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,400
but we can convert the integer to one

75
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,120
eye

76
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,080
okay we can convert the integer to one

77
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,480
to what type screen

78
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,959
digit and to the string and we can use

79
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,080
the which function to cut to get a

80
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,560
length

81
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,400
we can we can convert it to

82
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,720
a string and then

83
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,879
string strn and we want to use wall

84
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,280
function to get the length

85
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,280
which

86
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,519
and then we can just do this there we

87
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,440
can just do this

88
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,680
return length

89
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,440
strn and

90
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,920
we want to find out if it's even number

91
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,640
or all number right so modules two equal

92
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:38,319
equal one okay or you can just do this

93
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:40,080
one and one okay

94
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,440
ah

95
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,159
i have no idea

96
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,040
and the one n is the binary uh it's a

97
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,840
bit

98
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,680
so

99
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,640
great and one okay

100
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,959
equal equal one or you can omit that

101
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,879
yeah that's one way first yeah

102
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,760
the tangential for this one the number

103
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:02,640
of digits let's say d okay and then this

104
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,720
is o d i and then plot

105
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,480
uh and we consider the previous one

106
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,200
going through these numbers in the array

107
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:12,560
so the time connection is o and d right

108
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:15,840
okay this is the number digit for each

109
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,840
number okay

110
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:21,840
okay another method is we can use the

111
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,520
logs 10 function right

112
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,720
we we talk about the lock all the time

113
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,840
yeah lock

114
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:31,280
locked you can have different base 2

115
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:34,160
right log 2 a what's this number

116
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:37,600
2 to the power of y equals x a

117
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,720
3. yeah so look log

118
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,360
a

119
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,880
b

120
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:46,240
equals y so we can translate into a to

121
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,759
the power of y equals b okay so here the

122
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,280
same log ten

123
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:53,199
log ten

124
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,199
a thousand equals

125
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,320
three three you have your ten to the

126
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,400
power of 3 equals a thousand right yeah

127
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,360
so we can get these functions uh we can

128
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,840
use these functions to calculate now uh

129
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,320
we can use this math dot we can import

130
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,240
from the math master log 10 okay

131
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,440
master log 10

132
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,520
log 10

133
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,919
this number is n right

134
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,160
and i need to plus one

135
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,240
and convert to integer and we can return

136
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,600
this this thing if it's the even number

137
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,479
or number yeah

138
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,720
yeah

139
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,759
why this works okay so let's say a

140
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,080
thousand

141
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,680
a thousand and these things return to uh

142
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,840
return one

143
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,520
return three yeah three plus one four

144
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,160
digit right a thousand how many digits

145
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,720
one two three four four digit

146
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,919
uh a hundred how many digits three a

147
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,280
hundred log ten a hundred is two right

148
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,120
log ten

149
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,000
a hundred equals two two plus one you

150
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,000
got three okay how about 99 we don't

151
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,039
know yeah we don't know how many but is

152
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,240
that this low log 10

153
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:59,680
99 is smaller than 2 right smaller than

154
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:02,319
2 plus 1 is smaller than 3 right and now

155
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,639
we get an integer part smaller than 3.

156
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:07,199
we get an integer part so it's 2. so

157
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:10,319
it's two digits okay makes sense

158
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,919
but okay so let's before if we draw this

159
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,639
this function

160
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:16,319
remember this log term function yeah

161
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:20,000
when

162
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:22,960
when x okay so this is x here this is y

163
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,160
when x is one

164
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,680
log

165
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,440
ten one

166
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,440
ten to the power of one equals one

167
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,520
ten to the power of y equals one ten

168
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:38,319
10 to the power of 1 equals 10. if it's

169
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,280
1 that's 10 10 to the power of 1

170
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,880
2

171
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,919
10

172
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:47,199
come on think about it any anything to

173
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,560
the power of 0 equals 1 a not equals

174
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,639
zero okay

175
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:54,080
this is special okay

176
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:56,800
so 10 to the power y equals one come on

177
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,560
i'm writing that here 10 to the power of

178
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,720
y equals one eleven

179
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:04,400
zero zero okay 10 okay so look when when

180
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,199
x is one

181
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,960
y is zero okay so right here

182
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,919
when x is

183
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,199
ten

184
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,960
y

185
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,240
when x is ten

186
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,120
ten is here

187
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,280
y is what

188
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,240
log ten

189
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,000
ten

190
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,240
equals ten to the power of one equals

191
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,240
ten

192
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:30,160
one one okay so one why is one here okay

193
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,440
okay you can come on here there's

194
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,560
nothing 1

195
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,560
1

196
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:40,880
log 10 to the power of y equals 100

197
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:42,560
100 is your x is 100 here so y is what

198
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,400
twice

199
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,720
log 10

200
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:50,160
x yeah so basically this function is y

201
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:52,080
equals log turn x so x equals 0

202
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,440
x equals 1

203
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:58,720
y is y is 0 right x equals

204
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:01,039
x equals 10 y is 1 x equals a hundred y

205
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,319
is two so this function is like there

206
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,840
it's very very

207
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,280
yeah this way

208
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,919
am right

209
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,960
so from two to three

210
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,319
why

211
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,440
from

212
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:16,479
this is one two three why look

213
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:19,120
from two to three x needs to go from a

214
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:21,280
hundred to a thousand make sense

215
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,160
yeah all right make sense this is

216
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:28,800
mathematics come on it's useful

217
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:30,879
when x goes from a hundred to a thousand

218
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,080
a hundred here to a thousand somewhere

219
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,000
here

220
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,240
yeah somewhere here

221
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,200
y value from two to three okay make

222
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,200
sense yeah

223
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:47,040
so look 10 to the power of minus 1

224
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:49,440
equals 1 okay so look 10 to the power of

225
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:52,959
something yeah so a to the power of

226
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:56,320
minus b equals a to the power of b yeah

227
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:58,720
1 over a to the power b okay look

228
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,800
so what 10 to the power of minus 1

229
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:04,000
equals 1 come on

230
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,959
equals 1 1 over 10 to the power 1 so

231
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,560
it's

232
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,760
0.1 right

233
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,360
so 1

234
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,320
when

235
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,760
when

236
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,560
x is

237
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,560
1y look when y is what

238
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:21,680
10 so look log 10

239
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,680
what

240
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:27,200
equals look look x equals uh

241
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:31,279
let's say

242
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:34,000
0.1 okay equals what

243
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:37,200
okay so that equals minus one

244
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
uh no no no no

245
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,480
10 to the power of

246
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,839
so one when x is

247
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:49,600
1 x is 0.1 here

248
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:52,399
so it should be minus minus 1 here

249
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:55,040
okay so this graph is like that right

250
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:58,320
this is why how do we interpret this one

251
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,360
so y equals log ten

252
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,160
x

253
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,480
equals minus one okay because y equals

254
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:08,000
minus one so 10 to the power minus 1

255
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:11,200
equals 1 over 10 is 0.1

256
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,680
0.1 so x is 0.1 here

257
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,800
okay so look this this function this

258
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,839
graph

259
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:20,320
never hit

260
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,200
okay this is one important takeaway the

261
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,880
lock

262
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,360
the lock function

263
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:29,600
the local angle y equal log x

264
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,720
log a x never hits never crosses with y

265
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,519
right

266
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,760
yeah

267
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:37,680
because you can't find anything you

268
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:40,240
can't find anything a to the power of

269
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,959
anything equals zero yeah you can't find

270
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,959
anything to the zero

271
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,880
right

272
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:50,720
yeah you can't find anything to the

273
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:53,200
power of zero does it make sense

274
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:56,000
a to the power of b equals zero you

275
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,240
can't find anything

276
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,279
there's no such thing so this line never

277
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,600
crosses the y

278
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:06,079
make sense

279
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,480
yeah makes sense okay so look the

280
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,640
original question the number needs to be

281
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,120
positive yeah positive

282
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:16,480
so if it's zero we have to especially

283
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,800
say if and if n is zero we return one

284
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,440
right because zero is one digit

285
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,360
right you can't you can plug in using

286
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,720
this one look because we put a zero here

287
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,720
what happened

288
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,720
ten to the power of y equals zero

289
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,640
there's no such thing

290
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,600
yeah there's no such thing so this will

291
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:35,200
break

292
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,399
so we have to check if n equals zero

293
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,720
return

294
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:41,200
one otherwise we can return

295
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,640
listing to check this thing if it's odd

296
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,640
number or even number you know how to

297
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,320
check the number if it's even number or

298
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,920
or number right we can

299
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:52,399
modulus 2 yeah all right modulus 2

300
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:55,680
equals 1 then that would be

301
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:58,480
odd number if it's 0 it's even number

302
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:01,680
yeah or you can n this is the same thing

303
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,880
n one equals one

304
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,639
odd number

305
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,680
yeah binary yeah

306
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:10,290
what's what's one one one in binary

307
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,920
what's this number

308
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:14,639
[Music]

309
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:17,200
15. you see the last digit the last is

310
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,200
zero one if it's zero it's even up if

311
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,800
it's one it's all number okay the same

312
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,600
thing i x

313
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:26,000
yeah now the third way we can divide it

314
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,720
by 10 remember we can divide it by 10

315
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,399
and

316
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:32,720
look how do we check this how many

317
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:36,240
digits are there how many digits

318
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,079
how do how do we ask computers do it

319
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,399
computers don't have eyes don't come

320
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:43,519
look at it

321
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,519
we humans have eyes

322
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,240
how can we see where your mouth is going

323
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:53,320
to

324
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,320
so how do we we can ask computer to lead

325
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,480
how to

326
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:01,200
calculate how to get the length right we

327
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,839
can ask him to remove the last digit

328
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,720
look 10. yeah that's the second message

329
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,680
i have october start the measure remove

330
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,320
four

331
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,160
becomes one two three i have one digit

332
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,680
remove three

333
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,120
another digit

334
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,000
remove two

335
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,880
another digit remove one another digit

336
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,680
okay so how do we make sure and how do

337
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,800
we

338
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,920
make from

339
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:28,399
one two three four to one to three

340
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,399
how do we

341
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:33,600
moderate give you the last digit

342
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,920
divided by ten right

343
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,079
divided by 10 is the

344
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:41,040
modulus 10 is the largest look

345
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:43,279
one two three four modulus and

346
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:46,320
how many remains you divide it by ten

347
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,440
and then remainder right three

348
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,199
okay

349
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,519
yeah okay in python there's a method

350
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:53,839
called divide mode okay that's exactly

351
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,399
the difference

352
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,240
timer one two three four ten so what

353
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,480
does it give us it will give us two

354
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,839
values of couple right the first thing

355
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:06,480
is the is the

356
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:09,680
how do you say this the integer part of

357
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,279
between how do you say this

358
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,040
one two three four divided by ten what's

359
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:18,079
the integer power

360
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:19,279
123. yeah 100 what do you call this

361
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,399
equation

362
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,839
and then 10

363
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:25,680
and multiply 10 10 is 4 right so you

364
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,680
return two values okay

365
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,920
yeah so look

366
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,399
we we want this the cone how do you

367
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,399
spell it

368
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,160
okay so we want to continue okay

369
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,320
thank you for teaching me other thank

370
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:45,519
you

371
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,440
and this is called remainder right

372
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,040
yeah this is called remember 10 is

373
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,360
called

374
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,600
no no four is called remainder okay

375
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,000
divided by 10

376
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:59,920
kunshin yeah

377
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,399
uh so look so we can do this wire

378
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,800
while again we need to check especially

379
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:07,279
check if n is zero yeah if n is zero

380
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,399
return one okay and a y and bigger than

381
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,720
zero

382
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:13,680
and we have a digit t equals zero and

383
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:16,560
what should we do and divide it by equal

384
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:19,120
ten yeah we get an n divided by ten the

385
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,399
integer bar and then d plus equals one

386
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,639
and we can

387
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:25,120
return this digit that digit needs to be

388
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,399
even number all number yeah

389
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,240
okay

390
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,160
make sense

391
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,839
which method do you like the best which

392
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,480
method do you think is the most

393
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,480
efficient one

394
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,880
there's no right or wrong answer which

395
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,079
means which measure do you like the best

396
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,440
intent

397
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,759
your loved time you know that's

398
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,160
mathematics method and

399
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,079
this is the iterative thing

400
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,480
the first lesson remember converting to

401
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:56,320
string it's most intuitive way yeah we

402
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,000
just convert an integer to the string

403
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:01,040
and then we can get the length using the

404
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,360
length function to get the length right

405
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,480
which message do you like

406
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,440
in australia

407
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,320
you like

408
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:12,040
land equally yeah okay that's fine okay

409
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,040
good job today bye-bye
