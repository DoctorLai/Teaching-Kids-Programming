today we're going to talk about the
 

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,990
today we're going to talk about the
inverted binary tree okay

6
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:12,000
inverted binary tree okay
 

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,450
inverted binary tree okay
so what's the invert what's backwards

8
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:15,460
so what's the invert what's backwards
 

9
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:24,480
so what's the invert what's backwards

so one

32
00:00:58,630 --> 00:00:58,640
so one
 

33
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,709
so one
three six nine okay

34
00:01:02,709 --> 00:01:02,719
three six nine okay
 

35
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,869
three six nine okay
okay so can you tell me what's the how

36
00:01:04,869 --> 00:01:04,879
okay so can you tell me what's the how
 

37
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,070
okay so can you tell me what's the how
do you invert it can you

38
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:06,080
do you invert it can you
 

39
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,510
do you invert it can you
write it daddy

40
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:09,520

 

41
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,210

no no no we don't need it

42
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:13,220

oh okay so can you explain to us
 

47
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,990
oh okay so can you explain to us
what yeah you're all right so why why is

48
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:22,000
what yeah you're all right so why why is
 

49
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,030

you stop it but how about this 96 why is

54
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:35,680
you stop it but how about this 96 why is
 

55
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,030
you stop it but how about this 96 why is
it become on the left side

56
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:37,040
it become on the left side
 

57
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,789
it become on the left side
and three one is become on the right

58
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:38,799
and three one is become on the right
 

59
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,950
and three one is become on the right
hand side why is it not

60
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:40,960
hand side why is it not
 

61
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,550
hand side why is it not
like uh 31 69 why is

62
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:44,560
like uh 31 69 why is
 

63
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,710
like uh 31 69 why is
why this is not right why this is all

64
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:46,720
why this is not right why this is all
 

65
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,990
why this is not right why this is all
okay

66
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:48,000
okay
 

67
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,789
okay
because uh all you need to do is write

68
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:50,799
because uh all you need to do is write
 

69
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:51,429
because uh all you need to do is write
it down

70
00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:51,439
it down
 

71
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,670
it down
and it's like looking on the mirror but

72
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:53,680
and it's like looking on the mirror but
 

73
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,749
and it's like looking on the mirror but
the numbers are the right way around

74
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:55,759
the numbers are the right way around
 

75
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,670
the numbers are the right way around
okay yeah you're all right so yeah when

76
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:57,680
okay yeah you're all right so yeah when
 

77
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,149
okay yeah you're all right so yeah when
you it's like a mineral so when these

78
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:00,159
you it's like a mineral so when these
 

79
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,830
you it's like a mineral so when these
three one you'll become on the left side

80
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:01,840
three one you'll become on the left side
 

81
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,310
three one you'll become on the left side
okay

82
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:02,320
okay
 

83
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,950
okay
yes yeah yeah okay we're done so so we

84
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:04,960
yes yeah yeah okay we're done so so we
 

85
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:20,830
yes yeah yeah okay we're done so so we
can do it

86
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:20,840

 

87
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,229

here okay so look

88
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:24,239
here okay so look
 

89
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,430
here okay so look
oh wait if you tell me what to put up if

90
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:27,440
oh wait if you tell me what to put up if
 

91
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,869
oh wait if you tell me what to put up if
rude is numb

92
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:28,879
rude is numb
 

93
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:48,949
rude is numb
so what should we return

94
00:02:48,949 --> 00:02:48,959

 

95
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,030

you're doing this part okay yes

96
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,040
you're doing this part okay yes
 

97
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,190
you're doing this part okay yes
inverting this part which is left left

98
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:55,200
inverting this part which is left left
 

99
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,550
inverting this part which is left left
here and then

100
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:56,560
here and then
 

101
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,190
here and then
right equals inward

102
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:01,200
right equals inward
 

103
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,470
right equals inward
low downward right right

104
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:04,480
low downward right right
 

105
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,750
low downward right right
okay that's good okay now we cut this

106
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:07,760
okay that's good okay now we cut this
 

107
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,589
okay that's good okay now we cut this
left beat and wipe it now

108
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:09,599
left beat and wipe it now
 

109
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,710
left beat and wipe it now
we need to assign loot on left

110
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:12,720
we need to assign loot on left
 

111
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,390
we need to assign loot on left
equals what do the left equals one right

112
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:16,400
equals what do the left equals one right
 

113
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:30,869
equals what do the left equals one right
right yeah

114
00:03:30,869 --> 00:03:30,879

 

115
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:38,070

okay good job oh what's the complexity

116
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:38,080

 

117
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,229

what is n number of

118
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:42,239
what is n number of
 

119
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,270
what is n number of
n number of nodes in the root in a tree

120
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:45,280
n number of nodes in the root in a tree
 

121
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,070
n number of nodes in the root in a tree
yeah

122
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:46,080
yeah
 

123
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,750
yeah
got it yeah yeah bye so where is the

124
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:49,760
got it yeah yeah bye so where is the
 

125
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,350
got it yeah yeah bye so where is the
recursion happening where are the

126
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:51,360
recursion happening where are the
 

127
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,869
recursion happening where are the
recursion can you point to me

128
00:03:52,869 --> 00:03:52,879
recursion can you point to me
 

129
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,910
recursion can you point to me
where are the requests in this

130
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:55,920
where are the requests in this
 

131
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,070
where are the requests in this
in where are the questions what's the

132
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:58,080
in where are the questions what's the
 

133
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,070
in where are the questions what's the
one guys

134
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,080
one guys
 

135
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,840

where's the invert because yeah these

142
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:12,400
where's the invert because yeah these
 

143
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,990
where's the invert because yeah these
two yeah

144
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,000
two yeah
 

145
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,310
two yeah
these two are calling itself until the

146
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:16,320
these two are calling itself until the
 

147
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,069
these two are calling itself until the
root is numb when we turn now

148
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:18,079
root is numb when we turn now
 

149
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,430
root is numb when we turn now
otherwise every time we work we

150
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:21,440
otherwise every time we work we
 

151
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,909
otherwise every time we work we
invert that time right but we need to

152
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:23,919
invert that time right but we need to
 

153
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:24,550
invert that time right but we need to
swap it

154
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:24,560
swap it
 

155
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:53,150
swap it
like mineral right we need to swap it

156
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:53,160
