00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:09,030
okay yeah today we're going to talk
about a nice problem okay um probably no

8
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:09,040
about a nice problem okay um probably no
 

9
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,629
about a nice problem okay um probably no
coding okay just just mathematical

10
00:00:10,629 --> 00:00:10,639
coding okay just just mathematical
 

11
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,870
coding okay just just mathematical
problem uh it's from your book

12
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:12,880
problem uh it's from your book
 

13
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,509
problem uh it's from your book
yeah or for a book math project

14
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:15,519
yeah or for a book math project
 

15
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,430
yeah or for a book math project
so six identical

16
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:17,440
so six identical
 

17
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,269
so six identical
squares were side lengths of three

18
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:21,279
squares were side lengths of three
 

19
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,670
squares were side lengths of three
centimeters so six squares okay each one

20
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:23,680
centimeters so six squares okay each one
 

21
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,429
centimeters so six squares okay each one
sixth grade each one we say three

22
00:00:27,429 --> 00:00:27,439
sixth grade each one we say three
 

23
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,269
sixth grade each one we say three

12 yeah because four times four six

46
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:53,600
12 yeah because four times four six
 

47
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,270
12 yeah because four times four six
because we're gonna take up and there

48
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:55,280
because we're gonna take up and there
 

49
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,510
because we're gonna take up and there
are six of it so how can you how can we

50
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:57,520
are six of it so how can you how can we
 

51
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,470
are six of it so how can you how can we
rearrange the rectangles into using the

52
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:00,480
rearrange the rectangles into using the
 

53
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,310
rearrange the rectangles into using the
six rectangles

54
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:02,320
six rectangles
 

55
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,630
six rectangles
into a rectangle yeah six squares eating

56
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:04,640
into a rectangle yeah six squares eating
 

57
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,910
into a rectangle yeah six squares eating
a little

58
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:05,920
a little
 

59
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,510
a little
one of these

60
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:07,520
one of these
 

61
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,070
one of these
is you can place ten

62
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:10,080
is you can place ten
 

63
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,469
is you can place ten
what look you can put this yeah

64
00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:12,479
what look you can put this yeah
 

65
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,310
what look you can put this yeah
six six squares by ten ten oh like

66
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:16,320
six six squares by ten ten oh like
 

67

william said

68
00:01:17,749 --> 00:01:17,759
william said
 

69
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,789
william said
you can put it side by side so that's

70
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:20,799
you can put it side by side so that's
 

71
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,590
you can put it side by side so that's
another way of doing this okay

72
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:23,600
another way of doing this okay

14 times 3 okay
 

143
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,670
14 times 3 okay
okay so which one is bigger

144
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:43,680
okay so which one is bigger
 

145
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,790
okay so which one is bigger
yeah

146
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:44,800
yeah
 

147
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,750
yeah
okay so

okay so
 

149
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,229
okay so
this is quite simple and how about

150
00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:48,239
this is quite simple and how about
 

151
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,030
this is quite simple and how about
how about i tell you if there are

152
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,040
how about i tell you if there are
 

153
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,990
how about i tell you if there are
uh eight rectangles and how

154
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:54,000
uh eight rectangles and how
 

155
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,270
uh eight rectangles and how
what's the maximum we can get uh

156
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:57,280
what's the maximum we can get uh
 

157
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,790
what's the maximum we can get uh
that line one two three four five so

158
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:00,800
that line one two three four five so
 

159
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:14,630
that line one two three four five so
what's the what's the strategy of this

160
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:14,640

 

161
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,830

yeah

162
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:15,840
yeah
 

163
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,589
yeah
that's seven

164
00:03:17,589 --> 00:03:17,599
that's seven
 

165
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,949
that's seven
when you do like a square like yeah

166
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:20,959
when you do like a square like yeah
 

167
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,670
when you do like a square like yeah
yeah um you have more in the middle and

168
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:23,680
yeah um you have more in the middle and
 

169
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,070
yeah um you have more in the middle and
you go yeah exactly let's compare the

170
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:26,080
you go yeah exactly let's compare the
 

171
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,910
you go yeah exactly let's compare the
sixth one look so

172
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:27,920
sixth one look so
 

173
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,110
sixth one look so
if if the unit is each unit

174
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:31,120
if if the unit is each unit
 

175
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,830
if if the unit is each unit
what's how many how many if there are

176
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:33,840
what's how many how many if there are
 

177
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,270
what's how many how many if there are
six rectangles or six squares how many

178
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:37,280
six rectangles or six squares how many
 

179
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,110
six rectangles or six squares how many
one two three no no there are more than

180
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:39,120
one two three no no there are more than
 

181
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,670
one two three no no there are more than
that okay they're eight okay okay let's

182
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:41,680
that okay they're eight okay okay let's
 

183
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,630
that okay they're eight okay okay let's
see yeah if six go

184
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:44,640
see yeah if six go
 

185
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,789
see yeah if six go
each one is side of three and how many

186
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:46,799
each one is side of three and how many
 

187
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,030
each one is side of three and how many
sides of that four right this is total

188
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,040
sides of that four right this is total
 

189
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,270
sides of that four right this is total
number the parameters you can get you

190
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:51,280
number the parameters you can get you
 

191
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,830
number the parameters you can get you
can put it disconnected okay everyone

192
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:53,840
can put it disconnected okay everyone
 

193
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,070
can put it disconnected okay everyone
yeah so that's how many that's 72 right

194
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:58,080
yeah so that's how many that's 72 right
 

195
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,270
yeah so that's how many that's 72 right
if you that's a lot no no if you put

196
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:01,280
if you that's a lot no no if you put
 

197
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,030
if you that's a lot no no if you put
these one by one okay

198
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,040
these one by one okay
 

199
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,710
these one by one okay
what i'm saying is that if you put it if

200
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:04,720
what i'm saying is that if you put it if
 

201
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,670
what i'm saying is that if you put it if
you look if you put them disconnected

202
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:07,680
you look if you put them disconnected
 

203
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,429
you look if you put them disconnected
what's the total parameter all right

204
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:09,439
what's the total parameter all right
 

205
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,949
what's the total parameter all right
what's the total term

206
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:10,959
what's the total term
 

207
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,589
what's the total term
so each one yeah three

208
00:04:13,589 --> 00:04:13,599
so each one yeah three
 

209
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,949
so each one yeah three
three times four

210
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:14,959
three times four
 

211
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,870
three times four
that's six yeah

212
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:16,880
that's six yeah
 

213
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,069
that's six yeah
okay so

214
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:18,079
okay so
 

215
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,189
okay so
what happens if i do this to here look

216
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:21,199
what happens if i do this to here look
 

217
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,670
what happens if i do this to here look
what what's happening what's happening

00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:30,320

 

225
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,830

yes how many joint ages are there um two

226
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:33,840
yes how many joint ages are there um two
 

227
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,310
yes how many joint ages are there um two
four six eight ten

228
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:36,320

236
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:43,440
ten right yeah i said 10 10 okay so look
 

237
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,830
ten right yeah i said 10 10 okay so look
so that's perimeter of this one is what

238
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:45,840
so that's perimeter of this one is what
 

239
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,070
so that's perimeter of this one is what
72 minus

equals 42. yeah that's how we go and how

248
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:55,040
equals 42. yeah that's how we go and how
 

249
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,909
equals 42. yeah that's how we go and how
about this one 72 minus how many ages

250
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:57,919
about this one 72 minus how many ages
 

251
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,350

eight ten twelve fourteen so that's what
 

271
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,230
eight ten twelve fourteen so that's what
thirty yeah that's how we got 30. so

272
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:24,240
thirty yeah that's how we got 30. so
 

273
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,550
thirty yeah that's how we got 30. so
look this number we can calculate it's

274
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:26,560
look this number we can calculate it's
 

275
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,350
look this number we can calculate it's
always fixed yeah this number is fixed

276
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:29,360
always fixed yeah this number is fixed
 

277
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,510
always fixed yeah this number is fixed
this number let's say it's t

278
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:31,520
this number let's say it's t
 

279
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,390
this number let's say it's t
minus these joint ages the internet ages

280
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:34,400
minus these joint ages the internet ages
 

281
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,870
minus these joint ages the internet ages
like a this is the number we want to

282
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:36,880
like a this is the number we want to
 

283
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,350
like a this is the number we want to
maximize we want to we want to maximize

284
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:39,360
maximize we want to we want to maximize
 

285
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,430
maximize we want to we want to maximize
this number

286
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:41,440
this number
 

287
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,510
this number
we want to maximize this number

288
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:43,520
we want to maximize this number
 

289
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,350
we want to maximize this number
we want to make minus one this number is

290
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:45,360
we want to make minus one this number is
 

291
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,270
we want to make minus one this number is
fixed so we have two

292
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:47,280
fixed so we have two
 

293
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,670
fixed so we have two
so this number has to be

294
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:49,680
so this number has to be
 

295
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,830
so this number has to be
bigger or

296
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:50,840
bigger or
 

297
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,270
bigger or
smaller if we want this whole thing to

298
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:53,280
smaller if we want this whole thing to
 

299
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,070
smaller if we want this whole thing to
be bigger so we want this number to be

300
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:56,080
be bigger so we want this number to be
 

301
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,309
be bigger so we want this number to be
smaller how do we put it smaller what's

302
00:05:58,309 --> 00:05:58,319
smaller how do we put it smaller what's
 

303
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,990
smaller how do we put it smaller what's
the optimal solution

304
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,000
the optimal solution
 

305
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,990
the optimal solution
put in the line put it in the line right

306
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:02,000
put in the line put it in the line right
 

307
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,150
put in the line put it in the line right
so so it doesn't have cost more internal

308
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:04,160
so so it doesn't have cost more internal
 

309
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,629
so so it doesn't have cost more internal
edges right if i tell you that there are

rectangle what's how many edges two
edges one two

332
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:40,960
edges one two
 

333
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,430
edges one two
one two three four five there are six

334
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:43,440
one two three four five there are six
 

335
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,029
one two three four five there are six
yeah so it will be

336
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:45,039
yeah so it will be
 

337
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:49,749
yeah so it will be
six uh will be n minus 1 right n minus 1

338
00:06:49,749 --> 00:06:49,759
six uh will be n minus 1 right n minus 1
 

339
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,670
six uh will be n minus 1 right n minus 1
times 2 right

340
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:51,680
times 2 right
 

341
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,550
times 2 right
and then times m right this is number of

342
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:54,560
and then times m right this is number of
 

343
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,469
and then times m right this is number of
internal edges you can get so the answer

344
00:06:56,469 --> 00:06:56,479
internal edges you can get so the answer
 

345
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,029
internal edges you can get so the answer
will be y the answer will be what can we

346
00:06:59,029 --> 00:06:59,039
will be y the answer will be what can we
 

347
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,469
will be y the answer will be what can we
do this and this is the unit times

348
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:02,479
do this and this is the unit times
 

349
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:03,510
do this and this is the unit times
times one

350
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:03,520
times one
 

351
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,230
times one
and minus two times

352
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:06,240
and minus two times
 

353
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,469
and minus two times
n minus one right let's say if there are

354
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:08,479
n minus one right let's say if there are
 

355
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:09,350
n minus one right let's say if there are
four

356
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:09,360
four
 

357
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,150
four
four

358
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:10,160
four
 

359
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,629
four
four what's the what's the answer four

360
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:12,639
four what's the what's the answer four
 

361
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,070
four what's the what's the answer four
one two three

362
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:14,080
one two three
 

363
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,790
one two three
three times two six yeah four yeah okay

364
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:16,800
three times two six yeah four yeah okay
 

365
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,589
three times two six yeah four yeah okay
so the answer is what answer is this one

366
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:19,599
so the answer is what answer is this one
 

367
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,980
so the answer is what answer is this one
uh is it right

368
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:21,990
uh is it right
 

369
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,350
uh is it right

00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:27,360
is it like look there's something
 

375
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,710
is it like look there's something
there's something

376
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:28,720
there's something
 

377
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:35,110
there's something
and can

378
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:35,120

 

379
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,430

n square right so each one the total one

380
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:37,440
n square right so each one the total one
 

381
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,029
n square right so each one the total one
will be times four okay we forgot the

382
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:39,039
will be times four okay we forgot the
 

383
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,510
will be times four okay we forgot the
transform so there will be four n

384
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:41,520
transform so there will be four n
 

385
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,029
transform so there will be four n
yeah so that answer will be n times 4 n

386
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:45,039
yeah so that answer will be n times 4 n
 

387
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,629
yeah so that answer will be n times 4 n
minus 2 n

388
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:46,639
minus 2 n
 

389
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,589
minus 2 n
and then plus 2 right so this is 2 n

390
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:49,599
and then plus 2 right so this is 2 n
 

391
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,390
and then plus 2 right so this is 2 n
plus 2 so the answer would be

392
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:52,400
plus 2 so the answer would be
 

393
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,510
plus 2 so the answer would be
2 n plus 2

394
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:55,520
2 n plus 2
 

395
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,869
2 n plus 2
times m ok let's let's use this six if n

396
00:07:58,869 --> 00:07:58,879
times m ok let's let's use this six if n
 

397
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,270
times m ok let's let's use this six if n
is six two times six

398
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:01,280
is six two times six
 

399
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,469
is six two times six
twelve plus two fourteen times three

400
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:04,479
twelve plus two fourteen times three
 

401
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:13,690
twelve plus two fourteen times three
okay so the answer is this one

402
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:13,700

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,710
the optimum solution okay i'm going to
do that one more time can you can you

412
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:24,720
do that one more time can you can you

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,350
do that one more time can you can you
listen to me yeah we are

414
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:27,360
listen to me yeah we are
 

415
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,749
listen to me yeah we are
so there and this is the ultimate we

416
00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:29,759
so there and this is the ultimate we
 

417
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,749
so there and this is the ultimate we
just proved like

418
00:08:31,749 --> 00:08:31,759
just proved like
 

419
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,149
just proved like
and then n so what's the total number of

420
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:34,159
and then n so what's the total number of
 

421
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,110
and then n so what's the total number of
uh parameters for the n squared okay so

422
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:37,120
uh parameters for the n squared okay so
 

423
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,110
uh parameters for the n squared okay so
it's n times

424
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:41,120

 

425
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,070

and the side is m right this side is m n

426
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:44,080
and the side is m right this side is m n
 

427
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,790
and the side is m right this side is m n
times m but each one is they are four

428
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:46,800
times m but each one is they are four
 

429
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,509
times m but each one is they are four
four right this is the total and then

430
00:08:49,509 --> 00:08:49,519
four right this is the total and then
 

431
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,829
four right this is the total and then
how many edges in the middle

432
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:51,839
how many edges in the middle
 

433
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,030
how many edges in the middle
five six n minus one times two right so

434
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:55,040
five six n minus one times two right so
 

435
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,030
five six n minus one times two right so
this is the answer so look

436
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:57,040
this is the answer so look
 

437
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,470
this is the answer so look
four n and times m right so we we get

438
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:00,480
four n and times m right so we we get
 

439
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,949
four n and times m right so we we get
these n common terms yeah so m times the

440
00:09:04,949 --> 00:09:04,959
these n common terms yeah so m times the
 

441
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,150
these n common terms yeah so m times the
answer is l

442
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:06,160
answer is l
 

443
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,550
answer is l
four n minus two n

444
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:08,560
four n minus two n
 

445
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,910
four n minus two n
plus two

446
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:09,920
plus two
 

447
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,070
plus two
and that will be n times

448
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:12,080
and that will be n times
 

449
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,990
and that will be n times
two n plus two

450
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:14,000
two n plus two
 

451
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,829
two n plus two
right look yeah if it is eight

452
00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:17,839
right look yeah if it is eight
 

453
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,389
right look yeah if it is eight
let's do this two uh uh

454
00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:20,399
let's do this two uh uh
 

455
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,750
let's do this two uh uh
four okay four

456
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:21,760
four okay four
 

457
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,750
four okay four
to this or this

458
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:23,760
to this or this
 

459
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,590
to this or this
this is bigger yeah obvious this is

460
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:25,600
this is bigger yeah obvious this is
 

461
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,470
this is bigger yeah obvious this is
bigger

462
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:26,480
bigger
 

463
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,790
bigger
so look this is what

464
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:28,800
so look this is what
 

465
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,750
so look this is what
how many edges if m is one so at two

466
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:31,760
how many edges if m is one so at two
 

467
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,509
how many edges if m is one so at two
times four

468
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:33,519
times four
 

469
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,150
times four
two times four plus two is ten one two

470
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:36,160
two times four plus two is ten one two
 

471
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,150
two times four plus two is ten one two
three four five six seven eight nine ten

472
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:38,160
three four five six seven eight nine ten
 

473
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,070
three four five six seven eight nine ten
got it yes so if we write this define

474
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:42,080
got it yes so if we write this define
 

475
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,230
got it yes so if we write this define
so we can if we want we can just write

476
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:44,240
so we can if we want we can just write
 

477
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,750
so we can if we want we can just write
this define

478
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:45,760
this define
 

479
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,590
this define
we have maximum

480
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:47,600
we have maximum
 

481
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,509
we have maximum
parameters

482
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:49,519
parameters
 

483
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,829
parameters
and now we can say n squares each side

484
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:51,839
and now we can say n squares each side
 

485
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,310
and now we can say n squares each side
is m and we just written what

486
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:54,320
is m and we just written what
 

487
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,389
is m and we just written what
we can

488
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:56,399
we can
 

489
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,750
we can
n times

490
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:57,760
n times
 

491
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,829
n times
two n plus two okay what's the time

492
00:09:59,829 --> 00:09:59,839
two n plus two okay what's the time
 

493
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,949
