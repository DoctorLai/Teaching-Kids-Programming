1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,240
go

2
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:05,200
hello

3
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:07,919
hello michelle mr rhino all right

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,920
so today we're given a square metric

5
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,679
square metric yeah you know the square

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,040
metric

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,480
and

8
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,320
square matrix

9
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,680
for example this is the square matrix

10
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,039
three times three

11
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:25,600
and we want to find out if each row each

12
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,600
column contains all the numbers from one

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,239
not quite quite similar yes you do but

14
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:35,040
but no no no 1 to n for example this 3

15
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:36,239
this is n equals 3 3 times 3 so this 1 2

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,120
3

17
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,719
3

18
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,920
1 2

19
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:44,640
2 3 1 then that's okay why is that

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,640
because there's one degree there's three

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,200
one two there's two three one there's

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,440
one pretty the t won't create yeah

23
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,920
exactly so each row contains all the

24
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,840
numbers from one to and one to three

25
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,239
each columns contains all the numbers

26
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,840
from one to six okay this is one however

27
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,840
if i give another example

28
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,240
one two three

29
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:10,159
one three two two

30
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,400
two one one is it nine because

31
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,520
the first one yeah this one yeah and

32
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,320
then this one

33
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,159
okay

34
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:21,200
yeah easy yesterday's task easy

35
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:23,600
what's what's the idea um

36
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,479
you have to find

37
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,200
one

38
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,520
like

39
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,680
no no no no not necessarily the dire

40
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,600
ones just the rows and columns

41
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,200
but that's a very good point yeah rows

42
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,280
and columns

43
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,560
rows columns

44
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,880
content

45
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,450
content one to n

46
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,759
okay

47
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,560
[Music]

48
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,640
so

49
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:49,040
any idea we should solve this quick

50
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,720
so i mean this this problem is easy we

51
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,320
just go through each row

52
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,119
to check

53
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:58,719
if each row contains all the numbers one

54
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:02,000
to n we go through each columns to check

55
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:04,000
if each column contains one to n right

56
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,119
yeah

57
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,159
so

58
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,720
look

59
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,479
we are checking the numbers so we we are

60
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,560
not checking the sequence right we're

61
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,879
not checking the order sequence doesn't

62
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,959
matter but what matter is what the

63
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,040
numbers so

64
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:22,000
if we want to compare two

65
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,680
two i mean two lists have a sum

66
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,599
like one three two

67
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,920
or one two three

68
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:30,560
yeah these are the variants of the

69
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,120
permutation yeah but they are using the

70
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,599
same numbers so what kind of data

71
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,560
structure can you use

72
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,840
you know

73
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,000
to compare

74
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,000
these are all equal because what because

75
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,800
they only they all contain the same

76
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,640
numbers from one to three right yeah so

77
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,959
what kind of data structure can we use

78
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:52,160
to compare

79
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:54,239
if we turning into d3

80
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,680
into something

81
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,040
you know something that that is false

82
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,760
it's first

83
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,840
yeah

84
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:06,319
i'm saying this a is a list b

85
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,120
is this i want to find out if all those

86
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,400
three

87
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,840
this contains the same number of i items

88
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,000
same numbers

89
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,840
right so they they should be equal

90
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
because they all contain one two three

91
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,400
but different order so we want to

92
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,640
convert it how do we check this

93
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,040
we want to we can convert it to some

94
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,280
kind of you know three letters here

95
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,319
and then we can compare if these is the

96
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,519
same

97
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:33,040
any idea

98
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,040
what kind of data social have you

99
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,599
no no what kind of

100
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:41,280
data structure i mean the first one is s

101
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,040
the second letter

102
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,640
exclusive

103
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,680
so s what

104
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,319
set yeah set i just did that yeah so

105
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,200
we're converting these to set

106
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,560
yeah

107
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,560
then we can compare if the numbers are

108
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,760
equal right yeah the set is a very

109
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,840
useful

110
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:04,080
data structure the set contains unique

111
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,720
unique okay because we know these are

112
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,239
one to end only right so they they

113
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,239
contain the unique

114
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,840
numbers then we can compare if they

115
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:15,519
contain the unique numbers

116
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,160
right yeah okay so the the other thing i

117
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,959
want to look it's easy to go through the

118
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,560
nose right we just say for r in magic

119
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,880
and then you give us

120
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,800
if this is m okay then we say for row

121
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,360
in m

122
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,720
so this row will contain one two three

123
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,400
three one two

124
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,280
two three one yeah that's easy to

125
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,680
compare the row how about the columns

126
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,479
columns is not easy right

127
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,880
but in python we have this

128
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,639
we can use this chip

129
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,960
what's chip remember

130
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,199
what's chip

131
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,759
tip what's tip is

132
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:57,360
a zip yeah you put two things together

133
00:04:53,759 --> 00:05:02,000
remember look this is one two three

134
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:04,400
a equals that b equals one four five six

135
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,400
and what's chip a b

136
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,479
one three four five six

137
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,280
what's the ib come on one two three four

138
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,000
five six

139
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,960
look

140
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,720
this is a this is b one two three four

141
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,960
five six

142
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,840
look at this look this is

143
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,240
one four two five six yeah yeah yeah but

144
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,560
so look this is the shipping yeah you

145
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,360
just imagine there's a

146
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,199
that's your clothes chipping so one vote

147
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,520
so you want we have you will have a

148
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,280
couple one four

149
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,160
two five

150
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,759
three six yeah okay yeah we take one

151
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,639
element from each

152
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,080
yeah we check it yeah look dip it tip it

153
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,960
tip it

154
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,240
okay

155
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:50,560
okay so now this is another way

156
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,759
of doing that is that we can use the zip

157
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:56,240
function but a little bit special here

158
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,000
so instead of chip we put a star here

159
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,080
chip m

160
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,039
okay here

161
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,240
so

162
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,680
so look

163
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,880
here

164
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,960
1 2 3 3 5 one two two three four so when

165
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,800
i check please

166
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,440
and i convert it to a list because this

167
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,199
thing returns an iterator if i

168
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,160
convert it to a list then it will give

169
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,080
me what

170
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,000
it will give me and then you can tell me

171
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,280
what what it is okay you'll tell me what

172
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,039
it is you'll tell me is one

173
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,479
three two

174
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,919
three

175
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,759
uh

176
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,919
two one three

177
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,960
three two one

178
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,840
okay

179
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,840
yeah

180
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,720
so what what it is what it is

181
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,800
from here to here water

182
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,560
come on

183
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:51,280
this is magic and if we can start list

184
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,680
what do we get here

185
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,160
we have learned this before right look

186
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:59,680
one two three what happened from what

187
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:02,720
happened from this m to the transition

188
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:06,000
to this it's just

189
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:08,080
yeah i was like single we call it

190
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,039
we have done this before remember we

191
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,039
call it trend

192
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,440
expansion transpose and we don't need

193
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,360
transfers

194
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,520
this one transpose metric

195
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,120
okay so

196
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:24,560
so it's like so

197
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:27,199
to be more precisely what why why needs

198
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:31,199
to give the transfer so for example is a

199
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:32,319
equals like that okay so that's one two

200
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,800
okay

201
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:37,520
three four

202
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,840
and then five six

203
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,800
okay so let's let what was this what's

204
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,639
the

205
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:47,120
so it's a metric of one two three four

206
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,919
five six okay so this is the three times

207
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,440
two

208
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,680
matrix

209
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,319
so if we transpose it

210
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,440
if we do this this

211
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,840
tip

212
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,400
star

213
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:02,560
a so what is it what do we have

214
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,039
so you will have what it will take one

215
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,000
from each one one three five

216
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:10,560
so you'll be one three five

217
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,479
and then two four six okay

218
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,960
two four six

219
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,879
so look these these elements each

220
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,039
element is a tupper but it's an array of

221
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,639
tupper so basically this is kind of like

222
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,360
one three five

223
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:26,080
two four six

224
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,879
okay so look one two three four five six

225
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,639
if we transpose this look one two three

226
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,719
four five six is transpose this will

227
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,959
become one three five two four six how

228
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,560
do we get it look one two three four

229
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:39,519
five six we take

230
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,279
one element from each okay so look one i

231
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,320
take one for the first one

232
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,720
yeah

233
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,440
three for the second one five from the

234
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:51,279
third one so it's one three five yeah

235
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,320
second two four six okay let's call it

236
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,480
transfer

237
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,560
so if we do this what happened now we

238
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,120
can transport it and then look if we go

239
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,600
through the rows again and these will be

240
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,680
the columns of the original

241
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,920
metric right so we can check if this is

242
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,200
that one to end all right

243
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,800
yeah

244
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,399
makes sense

245
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,399
okay so then we can do this look

246
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,440
okay let's let's write it okay okay

247
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:21,680
[Music]

248
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,240
define let's say check

249
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,839
and i for this is a metric and first of

250
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,360
all i want to get the length the number

251
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,000
of rows

252
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:33,600
and i can say and then i can i i need to

253
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,040
construct a set of one to end okay so

254
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,519
let's let's

255
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,279
two and let's say v equals i want to

256
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:42,000
convert it to a set

257
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,880
and then i will have a range start from

258
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,279
one

259
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,200
to n right

260
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,839
okay so this is the

261
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:53,519
set set of the one two three right and

262
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,800
then i just need to compare four r in

263
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:59,120
m

264
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:01,600
if okay if r not equal

265
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,880
okay so look i is a release i need to

266
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,560
convert it to

267
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,200
a set ah

268
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,519
not equal v then we determine false

269
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,959
alright we are checking the rows right

270
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,399
we can

271
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:16,000
and then i need to do this for r in

272
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,120
chip

273
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,360
chip star and transpose it when you

274
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,360
transpose it the rows will become these

275
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,120
rows will become original

276
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,519
will be the original

277
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,120
the columns right so and i can say if

278
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,440
set

279
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,040
r not equal b

280
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,200
return

281
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,320
4 right

282
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,839
yeah

283
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,600
this is checking the rows this is

284
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,839
checking the columns

285
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,200
and if we all finish the check if at

286
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,200
this point will return what

287
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,760
what's the time complexity

288
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,760
what's the sample recipe

289
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,160
this is

290
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,839
there are n squared numbers here we need

291
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:09,200
to compare

292
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,200
yeah so what's that

293
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:15,279
let's say comparing the set oh n squared

294
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:18,000
yeah let's say we're comparing the set

295
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:20,240
is is constant time okay

296
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,240
is it constant time yeah uh

297
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,440
no it's not constant time but it's all n

298
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,519
time look this is n this is n

299
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,640
yeah and this is and this is n so okay

300
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:33,360
so transpose it we do it one time

301
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:36,079
three one times thing so it's actually

302
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,320
o n square right transpose will be

303
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:41,360
another one squared plus n squared so

304
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,360
it's it's out n square times two

305
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,519
is always squared okay

306
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,160
okay so this is one way of doing another

307
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:50,160
way okay which you might

308
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:53,839
might not um

309
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,839
find it simple to implement but uh let

310
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,079
me just

311
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,480
just say explain what um

312
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,560
what kind of

313
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,040
aggregate can we use to

314
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,279
to compare the equality right

315
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,279
so

316
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:13,120
what's this x and y remember

317
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,079
still remember exclusive or

318
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,000
yeah

319
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:21,120
n or exclusive or remember

320
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,120
remember the tables

321
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:29,839
n uh let

322
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,839
let's uh write this table okay

323
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,279
one zero one zero

324
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,959
if this is all

325
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:40,399
one on one

326
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:42,720
is one one or zero is one zero or one is

327
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,320
one zero zero is zero yeah one of them

328
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,200
is two is true

329
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,079
if this is n

330
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,240
two

331
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,600
one and one is two all others are false

332
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,000
right

333
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,079
yeah so this will become

334
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,639
yeah all right

335
00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:01,440
eric and ryan

336
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:05,120
needs to do work

337
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:08,000
so that's two things one one error to it

338
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:10,079
ryan didn't do it then that's false okay

339
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,600
yeah and now if how about you say eric

340
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:16,560
to eric all right so one of them

341
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:19,040
is true that is true right how about

342
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,519
exclusive or remember

343
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:25,519
one one is zero

344
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:27,600
zero zero is zero one zero is one zero

345
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,040
one is one okay so can you tell me what

346
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,240
what's exclusive

347
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:35,760
um if this is if they're both they both

348
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,839
are the same and then it's false and if

349
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,320
otherwise it's true yeah okay let's see

350
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,320
exclusive oh yeah exactly so it has to

351
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,120
be both has to be different to be the

352
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,880
same attribute to be one okay

353
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,720
okay so look

354
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,839
we we are checking we need we want to

355
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,920
check if

356
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,199
each row is one contains the number one

357
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,120
to n right

358
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:57,839
and how about if i i know you know

359
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:00,399
because one to n i can exclusive one

360
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:03,920
exclusive two exclusive three here

361
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,199
exclusive n right yeah if i say this is

362
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,079
x

363
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,320
right

364
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,639
and then if i exclusive all the numbers

365
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,800
again if i miss x

366
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:16,480
okay so can you tell me if i use this x

367
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:19,600
to exclusive one two three what happened

368
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,040
if i look i is s exclusive 1 exclusive 2

369
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,720
exclusive 3.

370
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:26,560
it chooses here n so what's this value

371
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:30,320
what's this value

372
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:32,959
come on x is one exclusive or exclusive

373
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:35,040
three exclusive to n and then i used to

374
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,000
add these x values to exclusive one

375
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,399
again

376
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,720
exclusive two exclusive three exclusive

377
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:44,360
four until exclusive n

378
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,360
so what's this value

379
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,320
what's the value from

380
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:55,519
so what does it mean x equals this then

381
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:58,639
it means that x1 exclusive one two and

382
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,920
then exclusive one again

383
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:03,839
yeah

384
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,839
so one exclusive one equals one

385
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,560
one

386
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,800
two exclusive two

387
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,720
if the same what

388
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:20,800
excuse me three

389
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:24,480
okay so x exclusive this whole thing

390
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:27,680
what's the value right zero yeah you see

391
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:30,079
because x is one exclusive or two to n

392
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:33,120
and then i exclusive one again to two to

393
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:35,920
n again so basically i exclusive the

394
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,160
same number twice right so that's the

395
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,240
important property if a number is

396
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,480
exclusive excel

397
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,040
it will be zero it's like an eraser yeah

398
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:48,639
eraser the same number

399
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:51,600
it chooses e7 and it makes it gone okay

400
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:54,480
yeah so i can calculate this value x

401
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:58,320
obviously and then i use this value

402
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,320
to do what to exclusive

403
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,920
yeah exclusive all the numbers in a row

404
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,240
and line must be 0 and i need to

405
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,880
exclusive all the numbers in the columns

406
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,040
and that must be zero right

407
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,959
yeah

408
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,839
any questions so far

409
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:18,560
i mean do you understand this approach

410
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,560
every friend

411
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,839
so what why this will work

412
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,720
right

413
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,279
look

414
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,600
one is good x exclusive one exclusive

415
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:35,920
two x goes to three

416
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,240
that should be zero exactly if we if

417
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,560
this is not zero it does not this row

418
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,600
does not contain the numbers from one to

419
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,399
three okay

420
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,480
yeah

421
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,880
okay so let me write it okay it could be

422
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,880
quicker

423
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:54,480
okay let's say define check

424
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:57,040
metric

425
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,639
and then i can say x equals zero and i

426
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,440
can say for

427
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,120
i

428
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,440
in range

429
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:06,079
i start from one to

430
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,199
uh okay so let's say

431
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,400
here will be

432
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:12,720
n equals length and okay

433
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:16,880
m plus one

434
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:18,480
x exclusive okay so this this uh this

435
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,240
symbol yeah you see

436
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,640
uh up error

437
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,000
it's on the number six okay number six

438
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,480
key

439
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,799
okay you press the shift six it'll give

440
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,600
you a list that's exclusive

441
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:35,039
equals i okay now we have x

442
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:37,600
and then i i just need to do what for r

443
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,960
in range

444
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,840
range

445
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,919
n

446
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,840
this is the row index

447
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:48,799
for c in

448
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:51,520
range and this is the column index right

449
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:54,480
uh but for each one i have to do this uh

450
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:57,200
let's say r equals x

451
00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:00,240
cc equals x and then i just need to

452
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:02,960
exclusive these okay so then i are

453
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,240
exclusive equals

454
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,080
metric

455
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:10,400
ah c

456
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:12,480
and then cc exclusive metric cr okay

457
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:16,320
this is the

458
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:19,280
okay so look i inclusive metric rc and

459
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,880
then metric ci is this one right it's

460
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,679
the it's

461
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:27,840
it's mapped it's a map around the

462
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:30,080
diagonal okay here this is metric rc

463
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:33,120
this one matrix er

464
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:35,039
this is metric okay so let's look

465
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,400
how can we access this number three

466
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,880
metric

467
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,000
zero two and what's this

468
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,640
what's this

469
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,640
where's this place

470
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,960
no no no this is zero too and what's

471
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,039
this

472
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,760
come on

473
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:55,039
why is this three two two here so look

474
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,039
rc

475
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,160
if this is magic rc

476
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,600
right

477
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,440
come on come on

478
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:04,960
listen to me

479
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:07,280
let's say rc is here if it's map or this

480
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,360
is diagonal and this this place is

481
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:12,559
metric cr okay

482
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,679
that's rc i know i know it makes sense

483
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,600
because look

484
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:19,120
where's these two locations

485
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,120
mrcm mcr

486
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:28,000
yeah symmetry along the time okay that's

487
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:29,919
what i'm saying yeah ah

488
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,400
i want to exclusive all the numbers in

489
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,480
the rows by rc i want to exclusive all

490
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,200
the numbers in the column by cr

491
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:40,080
okay and then here i i say if

492
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:42,160
ah r or c c

493
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:46,559
if one column is

494
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,559
not zero then we return fourth right

495
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,720
and then otherwise he'll return true

496
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:58,480
r or c c means that r bigger than one or

497
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,919
c bigger than one oh we can do this

498
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,640
max

499
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:05,840
r c c

500
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,919
if the maximum of these two numbers is

501
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,520
bigger than zero what does it mean it

502
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,080
means the one on them is bigger than

503
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:15,760
zero right if one of them is bigger than

504
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,880
zero it means what it means that either

505
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,039
row

506
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,480
one row does not contain all the numbers

507
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,799
from one to n

508
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,880
or the column does not contain all the

509
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,960
numbers from one right yeah if it

510
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,159
contains from all the numbers from one

511
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,880
to one

512
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,159
the the exclusive result if it should be

513
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,520
zero why is that because we are

514
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,799
exclusive the same number twice

515
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,400
right

516
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:41,039
okay i'm going to give another

517
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:44,320
mathematic question okay 2 exclusive 3

518
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:47,360
equals 4 exclusive 3 exclusive 2

519
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:49,840
exclusive 4. what's the answer

520
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:52,320
yeah because look two twice four twice

521
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:54,559
three twice yeah if you're exclusive

522
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,760
something twice

523
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:59,039
yellow

524
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:00,159
like razor yeah three i'm this eraser is

525
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,880
three

526
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,480
i'm exclusive this place

527
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,919
come

528
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,720
yeah

529
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,480
okay make sense here is eric everybody

530
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,840
is here

531
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,799
eric

532
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,799
excuse me eric

533
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:20,799
okay what's the time to investigate here

534
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:24,320
what's the time recipe come on look at

535
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:25,520
this we are going to the metric

536
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,720
yeah

537
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,720
so what's the time from let's say

538
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:34,960
sorry

539
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,960
and it's here so what's the time rustic

540
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,080
why is cubic where is the cubicle

541
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:41,120
because you

542
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:43,360
put it away three times

543
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,520
no only two squares i went square look

544
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,400
why is that one cubic look this is this

545
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,080
is

546
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,200
n right obviously r n yeah

547
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,360
o n

548
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,760
o n and that's it

549
00:21:53,360 --> 00:22:00,960
so that's o n square o n squared plus o

550
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:00,960
n what's the outcome which one is bigger

551
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:08,000
one square plus or n we drop the smaller

552
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:10,159
path so we keep the

553
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,600
most time-consuming part okay oh it's

554
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,919
great it's the same thing as here just

555
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,280
different approach okay so tell me to

556
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,240
sum up what have you learned so far

557
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,760
today about the matrix yeah what are we

558
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,600
doing with the magic

559
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:26,000
we are doing the sudoku thingy

560
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,280
trying to see if they have the numbers

561
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,280
in

562
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:32,080
from or each row and each column you

563
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:34,400
have all the numbers from one to n right

564
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:37,039
okay so how how can we do this what have

565
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,559
you learned today every line

566
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,799
how can we do it

567
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:43,440
which approach you think is better you

568
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,440
can remember

569
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:49,360
i can't remember any of them sorry

570
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,400
they're all very very very long i can't

571
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,960
remember

572
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:56,880
that's fine but do you know

573
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:59,200
the principle i mean i mean so

574
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,440
for this approach we are completing 22

575
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,200
minutes yeah yeah we are comparing that

576
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,799
we're comparing the

577
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,760
set yeah

578
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,320
all right

579
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,559
at least one we're exclusively

580
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:13,120
because we already know that

581
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:17,280
each one one this can be

582
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:18,960
computed from exclusive one to to n

583
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,720
and then

584
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,919
yeah we have a

585
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:26,080
we have an eraser containing the result

586
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,559
of one exclusive two exclusive three

587
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,919
exclusive tier m and then i use this

588
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:31,919
eraser

589
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:34,080
to rub it

590
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,960
yeah that's how i know what yeah and

591
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,760
then

592
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:40,320
if nothing left

593
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:43,760
is yellow right let me say

594
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,600
it's the one to end right yeah

595
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:49,200
makes sense

596
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:51,520
eric right come on anybody

597
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,279
yeah

598
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:58,320
okay so what have i what what have you

599
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:59,520
learned today so matrix yeah what magic

600
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:04,880
transformed

601
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:04,880
with only one two and yeah one two and

602
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,360
yeah

603
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,600
chip star m to

604
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:26,640
turn it 90 degrees

605
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:29,279
okay transpose is it 90 degree

606
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,400
look at this one

607
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:32,080
it will be

608
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,919
when i transpose this it will become

609
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,640
what one three five

610
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:38,880
one three five two four six

611
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,440
is it turns is it turning

612
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,440
clockwise 90 degree

613
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,600
no no not really because if you turn it

614
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:48,960
not clockwise it will be five three one

615
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:51,919
so it's not quite a 90 degree so how do

616
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,640
you turn this to here

617
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:56,720
you

618
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:58,400
mirror it you yeah mirror it and turn it

619
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,559
degrees

620
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,559
yeah

621
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,039
will be two one four three six five and

622
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,960
then turning 90 degrees

623
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,640
that way

624
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,640
anticlockwise

625
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,799
yeah okay

626
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:15,279
next of all transfer so basically it's

627
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:17,120
easy you just take one element from each

628
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:20,080
one three five and then take second

629
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:24,279
element two four six yeah

630
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,279
okay i'll be today bye
