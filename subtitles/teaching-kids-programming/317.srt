1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
hello hello

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,799
hello

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,919
and how are you today

4
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:11,840
okay so we may talk about a compaction

5
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:14,240
they watch this work complex compress

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,560
and decompress impressed

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,359
no no decompress what's these two words

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:22,240
in english you press something

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:25,359
uh no compress compress and decompress

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:28,320
convex let's say that's something

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,240
i have something some data and i want to

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,239
i want to send it over to internet uh

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,399
send over the internet internet you know

14
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:36,079
the internet to your friends yeah that's

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,440
what i said

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,680
what what

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,320
it's pushing into the internet pushing

18
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,360
into internet no not yet

19
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:48,239
in the internet you have a data like you

20
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,559
have a very big data in a very big data

21
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,199
like a picture yeah a picture of you

22
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,760
right and it's a very big yeah

23
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:58,160
yeah it's very big maybe one megabyte

24
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,079
you know this is a data set right in

25
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,079
computer one bite yeah

26
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,559
one bite

27
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,799
equals eight bit yeah

28
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,680
and then one kilobyte

29
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:13,600
one kilobyte equals

30
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:17,280
this is two to the power of 10 10 bytes

31
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,439
and then 1 megabyte equals

32
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,240
10 24

33
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:25,600
kb and then what's that 1 gigabyte

34
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:28,159
equals 10 24

35
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,000
nb okay and then one terabyte yeah this

36
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,240
is the unit yeah it's

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,680
it means how big is the data why is it

38
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:38,840
10 24 because it's 2 to the power of 10

39
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,400
2 to the power 10 right

40
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,360
okay

41
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,240
one bite eight bit what spit

42
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,000
fit

43
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,720
zero five one

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,960
you bite no no no no

45
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,560
no no no no no

46
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,079
the basic

47
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,560
information to storing the data zero or

48
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,880
one right because computers

49
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,560
uses the electricity right now the

50
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,000
electricity has this

51
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:09,039
on off right and the voltage will be

52
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,959
high low so so it's binary yeah that's

53
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:13,760
why we always talk about binary in

54
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,200
computer science right because zero one

55
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,520
you know you make a

56
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,200
computer a cheap circuit

57
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,440
you can control

58
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,319
the electricity right you can control

59
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,400
the flow zero one

60
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,000
one byte eight bit

61
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,400
array

62
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,440
one gigabyte

63
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,599
or so 1024 byte okay and so on

64
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,840
so look if it's one megabyte if i have

65
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:40,000
two pictures one

66
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,200
one size is one megabyte and the other

67
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,440
one size is 10 megabytes which one

68
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,440
which one do you think is faster to send

69
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,959
over the internet if you want to send it

70
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,319
to your friend

71
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,920
ryan if you want to send it to your

72
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,280
friend lucas yeah

73
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,440
yeah

74
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,720
and that's ryan

75
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,319
yeah i'm going to send you over the

76
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,480
internet

77
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,800
right which one you think it will be

78
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,920
faster to send 10 mb

79
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,239
one megabyte and 20 megabytes the data

80
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,440
one megabyte why is that because it's

81
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,640
more where down is smaller right yeah

82
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,680
it's smaller

83
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,319
yeah okay so this is uncompressed okay

84
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,760
can i have your attention please keep on

85
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,599
hitting me

86
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,920
okay sit there please

87
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:26,000
okay so now

88
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,879
how well if i say i have 10 megabytes if

89
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,599
i compress it to let's say i compress it

90
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,519
to one megabyte and before sending

91
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,879
you know i compress it

92
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,760
compress it

93
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:40,319
and then when lucas receive it he

94
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,760
received one megabyte of data

95
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,080
he doesn't see

96
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,720
it it's great in it he doesn't see the

97
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,680
thing about then on this side he needs

98
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,760
to decompress it decompress the original

99
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,560
data

100
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,560
to become a 10 megabyte and

101
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,200
then he can view the picture right let's

102
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,720
compress and decompress makes sense so

103
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,959
why are we doing this because we want to

104
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,040
shorten the time to send over the large

105
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,680
amount of data because the traveling to

106
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,159
send over the internet it takes time and

107
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,439
generally the less amount of data the

108
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,480
faster right

109
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,640
i'm right

110
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,639
it's it's quicker to send over like one

111
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,079
picture rather than temperature right

112
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,560
all right over the internet because the

113
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,919
computer needs to you know travel the

114
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,720
you know route to the routing cables you

115
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,880
know

116
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,960
going to that city maybe going to

117
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,520
another continent you know in china

118
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,240
right it takes time

119
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,080
let's compress decompress okay compress

120
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,160
so compression has two kinds of

121
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,600
compression one is

122
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,479
lossy

123
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,479
the other one is

124
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,440
so

125
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,160
how does it mean lossy it means you keep

126
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,440
on losing stuff well done i lost this is

127
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,600
the opposite

128
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,880
so why is that sometimes look

129
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,960
okay so the the lossy people

130
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,320
if for example you're making calls yeah

131
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,000
you're making calls

132
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:08,639
it's a it's a bit maybe a bit okay to

133
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,479
you know to lose some data

134
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,680
the people over the other end can still

135
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:15,039
hear you

136
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:17,280
right a picture you compress the picture

137
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,039
right

138
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,639
you know that nowadays the camera right

139
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,720
very high quality you take a picture

140
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,120
like 10 megabytes but it has some

141
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,759
details that human eyes cannot

142
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,240
tell right a big picture if i compress a

143
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,280
little bit your eyes cannot tear so it's

144
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,400
okay it's

145
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,560
lossless

146
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,039
uh it's lossy right

147
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,280
and lossless is the of the opposite like

148
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,199
a data very important you can't lose

149
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,520
anything right

150
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:46,479
i compress the data and when i do the

151
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,360
compression it needs to be fully

152
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,840
you know

153
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,720
it needs to be exactly like the original

154
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,680
right

155
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,360
okay

156
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,520
okay well this is compressed and

157
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,520
decompressed

158
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,639
okay so one way of doing it can you tell

159
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,000
me how can look let me show you a few

160
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,440
data and i want to send it over the

161
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,520
internet and can you tell me how do we

162
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,199
compress it you know just any idea look

163
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,759
i have this data yeah

164
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,600
a a a a

165
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,880
b b b b b

166
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,680
c c c

167
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,800
c

168
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,039
d okay that's it e e e so we understand

169
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,039
this

170
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,960
what's your approach look there are four

171
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:34,639
a's five b's and four c's

172
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:36,639
you get them look there's four plus five

173
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,039
plus nine

174
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,560
four like that's 13 bites you have 13

175
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,720
bytes

176
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,240
one bar is one character yeah

177
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,960
okay

178
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,199
13 points yeah 35 let's that's the

179
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,960
amount of data

180
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,880
that's the amount of storage that

181
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,280
required by a computer to store this

182
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:58,400
data a character yeah remember we talked

183
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:01,039
about ascii why ask it remember

184
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,039
american standard

185
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,800
uh i i have no idea what they call me

186
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,319
information exchange or whatever yeah i

187
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,240
think it's

188
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,960
coding coding

189
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,199
interchange inter exchange information

190
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,720
or whatever yeah

191
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,400
look a

192
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,520
97 yeah remember

193
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,960
a

194
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,840
65 right this still remember this

195
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,160
yeah

196
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:27,440
so look the ascii

197
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,599
is from 0 to 255

198
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,080
what's that that's one bite

199
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:35,919
why is that one by eight bit

200
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:38,880
a b two to the power of eight

201
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:40,960
right that's two hundred fifty six

202
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,199
two hundred fifty six is from zero to

203
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:46,000
two hundred fifty five okay

204
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:48,479
so let's let's four bytes five bytes

205
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,120
four bytes that's 13 bytes

206
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,160
okay i have to if i i'm not compressing

207
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,080
this

208
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,520
if i'm not compressing this how many i

209
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,080
need to send certain bytes over the

210
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,840
internet is there a way let you know you

211
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,120
and your friend like your friend daniel

212
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,160
lucas

213
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,639
yeah can decompress on the other side

214
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,720
do not look at this pattern

215
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:11,360
let's be fair i'll give you one hint if

216
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,479
i have this a minion c

217
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,199
here

218
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,199
armenian sea

219
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,199
are you actually going to send a

220
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,520
ministry over there no then how do we

221
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,120
tell lucas your friend right then your

222
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,840
friend

223
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,520
to decompress

224
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:30,240
it you know instead of receiving that

225
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,000
amenity alien

226
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,120
can we just tell that

227
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,760
it has

228
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,959
one bite a hair has how many how many

229
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:41,680
number of c at the end and then lucas

230
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,479
can reconstruct the data

231
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,640
right

232
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:49,680
so how about if i tell if i

233
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,680
if i compress this using look 4 times a

234
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,360
5 times b

235
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,279
yeah

236
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,640
a million huh i don't know a million how

237
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,600
many zeros

238
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,920
six

239
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,399
six zero see

240
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,240
okay if i hop by if i sending this

241
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,240
over the internet

242
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,360
i will look at the authenticity from the

243
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,680
iron

244
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,839
he may seem exactly a string

245
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,240
but this is the compressed version so he

246
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,320
can compress it decompress it

247
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,360
he can decompress it yeah he said okay i

248
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:22,399
see it's four i have received a sequence

249
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:26,800
four a five b and a mean and c so you

250
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:29,040
will try to a plus a a a a b b b b b and

251
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,320
then b and c okay so which one is

252
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,399
quicker

253
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,279
which one is quicker

254
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:39,040
which one is quicker

255
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,040
um very obvious which one

256
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,880
the second one yeah yeah because look

257
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,600
how many characters we need to see how

258
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:48,800
many bytes one two three four five six

259
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,279
seven eight nine ten eleven twelve

260
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,959
yeah 12 bytes

261
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,959
and how many bytes here

262
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:58,000
a minion and

263
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:59,680
a minion knife wow that's a huge

264
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,360
save right

265
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,160
make sense

266
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,160
yeah

267
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,640
that's complexion that's that's what

268
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,800
this is one of the basic

269
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,160
this is one of the basic techniques okay

270
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,920
there are many many compression

271
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,120
algorithms right and this is one of the

272
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,959
very very basic it's called run lens

273
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,440
run

274
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,279
lens why is called one lens because look

275
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,000
you're running and this is number of

276
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:25,120
lens yeah one lens

277
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,360
yeah

278
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,680
what is that you say round length yeah

279
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,720
this is kind of oneness

280
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:35,839
okay and then let's do this if we have a

281
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,160
data you know which is that encoded

282
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:41,519
version of the rundowns yeah for example

283
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,560
like what do we just say 4a

284
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,079
2b

285
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,680
3c

286
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:50,399
and then only there's only

287
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:53,519
only the lowercase characters okay if it

288
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,600
does if it doesn't contain the

289
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,120
the numbers yeah because if content

290
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,040
number there's no way to tell if it's

291
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,839
one or part of the

292
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,600
yeah

293
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,240
there's no long way to tell if it's part

294
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,640
of the lens or it's part of the data

295
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,680
okay so given this data we want to come

296
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,279
what's the

297
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:13,880
uh what's the decal version of the

298
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,880
original data 4a to b3c

299
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,279
we're done so that's it today's task

300
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,279
yeah

301
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,440
so we can just go through that let me

302
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,440
see i created

303
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,800
so we just go through these past this

304
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:36,160
string character by a character if it's

305
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:38,959
a digit if it's a digit we remember it

306
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,640
and if it's a character we we remember

307
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:43,519
it yeah and then

308
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,519
at the end we can use these remember we

309
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,399
can use in the pricing yeah in the past

310
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,959
and look

311
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:52,320
what's this four times

312
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:56,800
a impression right that will give

313
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,800
a a a right everybody

314
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,560
okay how about zero times

315
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:05,519
a b c what's the b

316
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,639
d l times a b c in pi zero

317
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:11,000
zero

318
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,000
it's nothing nothing empty string

319
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,839
so

320
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,680
we can use

321
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:27,760
look can you go let's see please all

322
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,720
right oh yeah see there

323
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:33,600
yes so we can have a data array right so

324
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,000
first this is array so look look at me

325
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,600
how i ins how i go through this

326
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,600
algorithm look

327
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,440
okay if it's a

328
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,480
if it's a number

329
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:47,680
i i remember it is four right

330
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,959
okay the next one is the letter a letter

331
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,519
a

332
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:53,920
then i push the number and

333
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,560
a in in the in this

334
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,560
and then number two again i remember

335
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,519
this and b

336
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,639
right

337
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:05,519
i look and i push it again two and b so

338
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:08,320
and then again three c actually see we

339
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,320
see the class okay so eventually we have

340
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,480
this data array which is like that okay

341
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,160
how about the digits could be multiple

342
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,320
right it could be more than 10 so if i

343
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,480
have 33c

344
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,800
if i have a 33c

345
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,040
if i have a 33c right

346
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,639
so we have first first of all we

347
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,360
remember the number three but the second

348
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,360
time

349
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,920
is also a digit so we need to update the

350
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,600
number with uh 233 and then until we

351
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,880
meet a character

352
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,279
a data

353
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,200
so we put it here we just put every time

354
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:39,519
we push a pair which is the number of

355
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,519
times the data has occurred right once

356
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,360
we have this data we can just return so

357
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,519
you'll become see

358
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,720
return

359
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,959
remember

360
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,959
john

361
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,959
so you want to join these two right

362
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,959
we're going to join these two

363
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,000
so theta

364
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,760
i

365
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,199
times

366
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,800
theta a prime a plus one right

367
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,760
theta i times i

368
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,440
for

369
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,360
i in

370
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,240
range

371
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,079
length data

372
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,399
right and the step is two right because

373
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:20,959
every time we we we go two step it's

374
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:24,320
four and then two and then thirty two so

375
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:25,920
we every time we we we construct this

376
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,600
piece

377
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,760
construct this piece and we join it

378
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,519
together okay but let's let's implement

379
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,399
this okay

380
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,399
let's implement it

381
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,880
what do you what did you do you just

382
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,480
said get it implemented yeah

383
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:48,720
defined define

384
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,720
players

385
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,880
or whether we have these what the string

386
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,480
s

387
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,480
first of all we need to account for c

388
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,199
equals zero and we put this answer in

389
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,079
the

390
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,560
line

391
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:02,399
and then go through this number for i

392
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:06,079
for we go through this string and

393
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:08,800
remember this 2 a 3 b

394
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:10,079
3 a 33 b

395
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,760
2

396
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,440
2 c okay

397
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:16,480
we go through this number

398
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:19,600
and then if if how do we check if this i

399
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:22,800
is an integer it's a number

400
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:25,920
it's a letter it's a digit from zero to

401
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:29,040
nine nine is a is a number so we can do

402
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,639
this if i dot is digit yeah

403
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,800
python has this function to check if

404
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:36,000
it's digit so this is the same same

405
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,040
thing as if i is bigger than 0 smaller

406
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,519
than

407
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,839
9 right or you can do this all right

408
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,160
this thing remember over the i

409
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,160
ord

410
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,720
0

411
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:51,360
is what 40 a right

412
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,959
is it for t n yes

413
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,199
okay

414
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:57,040
if i is it this digit

415
00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:00,160
if it's digit then i want to update a

416
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,199
number which i can say c equals c times

417
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,759
10

418
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:07,120
right look i i'm currently at 3 and i

419
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:08,320
want to make 3 to 33 how can i do this 3

420
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,320
times ten

421
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:13,040
plus the second three yeah

422
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,959
a hundred twenty twenty eight if i'm fc

423
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,920
is a hundred is twelve and how can i

424
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:19,360
make c

425
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:23,120
c to be 128

426
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:25,040
c times ten plus a right got it that's

427
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,160
how we get the number c equals c times

428
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:30,079
10 plus the i is a digit so one way of

429
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,399
doing when we convert it

430
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:35,279
convert the digit to the integer or we

431
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:37,120
can do this we can do this over the i

432
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:40,560
and minus for the area this is the same

433
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:43,759
thing because the ascii code of the

434
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,279
ascii code of zero is 48 and we just

435
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,759
need to minus that

436
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:50,959
if it's a number we just we just update

437
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,720
the c and if it's not a number

438
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:56,399
we need to append it to the data i have

439
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:59,120
to answer answer the append

440
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:01,199
append c right and what's the next i

441
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:04,559
need to append remember i remember i

442
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:07,600
have this 2 and an a i need to append

443
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:10,480
this yeah 33 and bi

444
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,480
so what's this

445
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,679
one

446
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,679
i just pointed

447
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:21,360
i have the wrong letter

448
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:24,640
yeah

449
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,319
so once we look once this i

450
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,600
we push it then we need to update the

451
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,760
counter to what

452
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,840
we have to update the c to what we have

453
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,000
used it so we have to update prepare for

454
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,000
the next iteration which is to be set to

455
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,640
what the counter how many

456
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,760
c is the number of characters

457
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,799
you know

458
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:46,080
enough for the following characters so

459
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:47,039
what should i update c2

460
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,160
idea

461
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,160
c equals y come on

462
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,120
remember we have used this two twenty

463
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,200
two twenty two b and then before we want

464
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:00,880
to process the next pair so what's c

465
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:03,840
equals to at the beginning two now the

466
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,919
two is the next one one is zero nothing

467
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:09,200
nothing what's nothing in in numbers

468
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,880
list what's the matter what's the right

469
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,039
yellow come on okay i'm a football

470
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,799
player okay now look

471
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,720
now look hey

472
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:20,000
okay can you tell me what's the answer

473
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,440
after this right if the if the s is

474
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,280
2a

475
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,559
32b

476
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,880
7c

477
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,880
so can you tell me what the answer is

478
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,400
what does the answer contain

479
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,559
a

480
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,559
no no no the answer is the list remember

481
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:37,679
from c and i to it

482
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:39,360
we append c and i to it so what's the

483
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,240
what's the answer that's going to be

484
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,520
like

485
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,200
it's a list of pairs c and i see the

486
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,600
number

487
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,600
come on

488
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,640
it's a pair of uh he puts the you print

489
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:54,480
the c and he puts the i so what's c for

490
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,679
the first pair

491
00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:00,160
um come on what's that next

492
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,160
and then

493
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,200
come on

494
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,200
33 and then

495
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,120
be

496
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,960
seven

497
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:13,120
yeah okay so that was that's what this

498
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:15,120
piece of work does to convert this s

499
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,039
into this bit yeah

500
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,559
but this is not a final answer we need

501
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:20,240
to

502
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,480
remember we need to

503
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,880
use the times this together yeah 2 times

504
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,600
a a 32 times

505
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,919
33 times b you know 32 b's together

506
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,559
seven c c c then we need to join them

507
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:35,760
together so we just pretend yeah i've

508
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,760
written this before right

509
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,559
join

510
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,440
answer

511
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,600
i

512
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,559
times answer

513
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,600
i plus one yeah answer i times i plus

514
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,480
one

515
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,440
four

516
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,000
i

517
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,520
in range

518
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,320
how many of these

519
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,320
lengths theta

520
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:02,720
okay it's actually it should be zero

521
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:05,280
let's theta two right because start from

522
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,559
zero and up to length theta and the step

523
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,880
is two

524
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:11,200
the step is two

525
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,200
okay

526
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,440
okay so uh make sense

527
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,559
yeah so what's this week can you tell me

528
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,880
what's this

529
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,880
it's doing great so what does this mean

530
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,080
this time this understands this like

531
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:33,720
this and i put it all together right yes

532
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,720
this time this is

533
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,080
yeah

534
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,080
okay what's the term complexity

535
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:47,039
n is the number of string characters

536
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,320
yeah what's the space complexity

537
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:52,320
um are we using this space

538
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,400
yeah

539
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:58,919
okay

540
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,919
okay that's it for today bye bye

541
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,600
bye
