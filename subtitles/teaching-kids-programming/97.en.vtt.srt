00:00:09,669 --> 00:00:09,679
we're going to talk about a final
 

7
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,589
we're going to talk about a final
research tree again by what spine

8
00:00:11,589 --> 00:00:11,599
research tree again by what spine
 

9
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,950
research tree again by what spine
research tree can you remind me

10
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:14,960
research tree can you remind me
 

11
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,590
research tree can you remind me
with someone else and finally search

12
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:17,600
with someone else and finally search
 

13
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,590
with someone else and finally search
tree with the nose so what what is the

14
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:19,600
tree with the nose so what what is the
 

15
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,029
tree with the nose so what what is the
tree about i mean

16
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:21,039
tree about i mean
 

17
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,269
tree about i mean
what kind of binary tree is a binary

18
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:23,279
what kind of binary tree is a binary
 

19
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:24,390
what kind of binary tree is a binary
surgery

20
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:24,400
surgery
 

21
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,310
surgery
a binding binary third tree on the left

22
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:28,320
a binding binary third tree on the left
 

23
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,509
a binding binary third tree on the left
side is

24
00:00:29,509 --> 00:00:29,519
side is
 

25
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,870
side is
smaller than the adult and

26
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:32,880
smaller than the adult and
 

27
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,069
smaller than the adult and
the right side is bigger than

28
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:36,079
the right side is bigger than
 

29
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,270
the right side is bigger than
yellow then parents not at all yeah yeah

30
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:39,280
yellow then parents not at all yeah yeah
 

31
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,790
yellow then parents not at all yeah yeah
yeah you can say this is

32
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:40,800
yeah you can say this is
 

33
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,510
yeah you can say this is
the kids okay good job uh okay so like

34
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:43,520
the kids okay good job uh okay so like
 

35
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:43,990
the kids okay good job uh okay so like
like

36
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:44,000
like
 

37
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,350
like
that okay so so the left

38
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:47,360
that okay so so the left
 

39
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,990
that okay so so the left
is strictly smaller than the parents and

40
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:50,000
is strictly smaller than the parents and
 

41
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,950
is strictly smaller than the parents and
the right is

42
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:50,960
the right is
 

43
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,430
the right is
strictly larger than the parents okay

44
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:53,440
strictly larger than the parents okay
 

45
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,630
strictly larger than the parents okay
yes

46
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:54,640
yes
 

47
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,630
yes
okay so now this is one parent between

48
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:56,640
okay so now this is one parent between
 

49
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,470
okay so now this is one parent between
the street and another tree like

50
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:58,480
the street and another tree like
 

51
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,790
the street and another tree like
five one

52
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:02,800
five one
 

53
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,469
five one
yeah seven and eight

54
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:06,479
yeah seven and eight
 

55
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,190
yeah seven and eight
and then that'll be six okay so i give

56
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:09,200
and then that'll be six okay so i give
 

57
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,789
and then that'll be six okay so i give
you two primary search three

58
00:01:10,789 --> 00:01:10,799
you two primary search three
 

59
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,789
you two primary search three
and then how about if i give i give you

60
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:12,799
and then how about if i give i give you
 

61
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:13,830
and then how about if i give i give you
a target like

62
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:13,840
a target like
 

63
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,789
a target like
nine or maybe maybe five okay let's say

64
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:16,799
nine or maybe maybe five okay let's say
 

65
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,230
nine or maybe maybe five okay let's say
five

66
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:18,240
five
 

67
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,830
five
so five talking is five so

68
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:21,840
so five talking is five so
 

69
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,230
so five talking is five so
can you tell me whether there are notes

70
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:24,240
can you tell me whether there are notes
 

71
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,190
can you tell me whether there are notes
in

72
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:25,200
in
 

73
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,390
in
i picked one note from each tree okay

74
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:28,400
i picked one note from each tree okay
 

75
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,149
i picked one note from each tree okay
pay attention it's one note from each

76
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:30,159
pay attention it's one note from each
 

77
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,990
pay attention it's one note from each
tree you can pick two from both three

78
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:32,000
tree you can pick two from both three
 

79
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,749
tree you can pick two from both three
okay one either tree you pick one from

80
00:01:33,749 --> 00:01:33,759
okay one either tree you pick one from
 

81
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,109
okay one either tree you pick one from
either tree

82
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:35,119
either tree
 

83
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,030
either tree
and then you make some up to five four

84
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:37,040
and then you make some up to five four
 

85
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,590
and then you make some up to five four
one yeah we're done four one yeah

86
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:41,600

 

87
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,590

so do you get it yeah and if i tell you

88
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:43,600
so do you get it yeah and if i tell you
 

89
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,149
so do you get it yeah and if i tell you
a hundred t equals 100 you tell me four

90
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:46,159
a hundred t equals 100 you tell me four
 

91
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,469
a hundred t equals 100 you tell me four
okay yeah because you can't find any

92
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:50,479
okay yeah because you can't find any
 

93
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:50,950
okay yeah because you can't find any
number

94
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:50,960
number
 

95
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,990
number
any two numbers from people's trees

96
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:54,000
any two numbers from people's trees
 

97
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,350
any two numbers from people's trees
let's sum up to a hundred okay so

98
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:57,360
let's sum up to a hundred okay so
 

99
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,749
let's sum up to a hundred okay so
can we what's your thoughts about this

100
00:01:59,749 --> 00:01:59,759
can we what's your thoughts about this
 

101
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:00,630
can we what's your thoughts about this
problem

102
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:00,640
problem
 

103
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,749
problem
how can we manage it

104
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:03,759
how can we manage it
 

105
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,190
how can we manage it
how can we do it for example like uh

106
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:07,200
how can we do it for example like uh
 

107
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,229
how can we do it for example like uh
five okay five yeah yeah so look

108
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:10,239
five okay five yeah yeah so look
 

109
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,110
five okay five yeah yeah so look
if i'm here i have two trees yeah point

110
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,120
if i'm here i have two trees yeah point
 

111
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,750
if i'm here i have two trees yeah point
here

112
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:13,760
here
 

113
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,630
here
so what's the sum of these two nine okay

114
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:16,640
so what's the sum of these two nine okay
 

115
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,309
so what's the sum of these two nine okay
and then i'm looking for five

116
00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:18,319
and then i'm looking for five
 

117
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,430
and then i'm looking for five
am right so what does it mean

118
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:21,440
am right so what does it mean
 

119
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,710
am right so what does it mean
one of them go to the right

120
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:24,720
one of them go to the right
 

121
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,110
one of them go to the right
one let's go to the left here so these

122
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:27,120
one let's go to the left here so these
 

123
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,869
one let's go to the left here so these
could go to the left or this could go to

124
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:28,879
could go to the left or this could go to
 

125
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:29,910
could go to the left or this could go to
the left yeah

126
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:29,920
the left yeah
 

127
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,589
the left yeah
yeah all right so you you can search

128
00:02:33,589 --> 00:02:33,599
yeah all right so you you can search
 

129
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,390
yeah all right so you you can search
these three underneath three these three

130
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:36,400
these three underneath three these three
 

131
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,190
these three underneath three these three
yeah

132
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:37,200
yeah
 

133
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,229
yeah
yeah another three for example i know

134
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:40,239
yeah another three for example i know
 

135
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,430
yeah another three for example i know
okay so zero yeah so basically

136
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:43,440
okay so zero yeah so basically
 

137
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,150
okay so zero yeah so basically
i i want they only put two possibilities

138
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:46,160
i i want they only put two possibilities
 

139
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,430
i i want they only put two possibilities
either

140
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:47,440
either
 

141
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,070
either
it's in these three and then this

142
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:50,080
it's in these three and then this
 

143
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,229
it's in these three and then this
structure the same problem yep

144
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:52,239
structure the same problem yep
 

145
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,589
structure the same problem yep
yeah or it will be in this tree

146
00:02:55,589 --> 00:02:55,599
yeah or it will be in this tree
 

147
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,149
yeah or it will be in this tree
and then this three yeah so you either

148
00:02:58,149 --> 00:02:58,159
and then this three yeah so you either
 

149
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,190
and then this three yeah so you either
pick one

150
00:02:59,190 --> 00:02:59,200
pick one
 

151
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,830
pick one
root to go to the left yeah because we

152
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:01,840
root to go to the left yeah because we
 

153
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,030
root to go to the left yeah because we
want to

154
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:03,040
want to
 

155
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,670
want to
we want a smaller sum which is five all

156
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:05,680
we want a smaller sum which is five all
 

157
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,229
we want a smaller sum which is five all
right

158
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:06,239
right
 

159
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,949
right
but now we have what we have got is nine

160
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:08,959
but now we have what we have got is nine
 

161
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,309
but now we have what we have got is nine
all right

162
00:03:10,309 --> 00:03:10,319
all right
 

163
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,070
all right
yeah so we want the smaller one so how

164
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:12,080
yeah so we want the smaller one so how
 

165
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,070
yeah so we want the smaller one so how
do we make a smaller one we pick

166
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:14,080
do we make a smaller one we pick
 

167
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,470
do we make a smaller one we pick
one of them there are two choices okay

168
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:16,480
one of them there are two choices okay
 

169
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,869
one of them there are two choices okay
pick one of them go to the left yeah

170
00:03:18,869 --> 00:03:18,879
pick one of them go to the left yeah
 

171
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,949
pick one of them go to the left yeah
okay and if we are looking for

172
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:22,959

 

173
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,789

uh let's say eleven eight and three

174
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:26,799
uh let's say eleven eight and three
 

175
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,309
uh let's say eleven eight and three
four and seven okay yeah so look

176
00:03:30,309 --> 00:03:30,319
four and seven okay yeah so look
 

177
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,430
four and seven okay yeah so look
so look four and five is smaller than

178
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:33,440
so look four and five is smaller than
 

179
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,710
so look four and five is smaller than
eleven so we have to move one of them to

180
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:36,720
eleven so we have to move one of them to
 

181
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,750
eleven so we have to move one of them to
the right because

182
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:37,760
the right because
 

183
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,550
the right because
it will be bigger right so it will be

184
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:40,560
it will be bigger right so it will be
 

185
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,030
it will be bigger right so it will be
seven

186
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,040
seven
 

187
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,869
seven
and these three these two will be set

188
00:03:42,869 --> 00:03:42,879
and these three these two will be set
 

189
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,149
and these three these two will be set
and all

190
00:03:44,149 --> 00:03:44,159
and all
 

191
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,830
and all
will be these three and then this

192
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:45,840
will be these three and then this
 

193
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,550
will be these three and then this
substrate do you get it

194
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:48,560
substrate do you get it
 

195
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,910
substrate do you get it
yeah yeah okay so now let's write this

196
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:51,920
yeah yeah okay so now let's write this
 

197
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,869
yeah yeah okay so now let's write this
code

198
00:03:52,869 --> 00:03:52,879
code
 

199
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,710
code
we can use this uh recursion

200
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:56,720
we can use this uh recursion
 

201
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,949
we can use this uh recursion
strategy okay define

202
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:00,959
strategy okay define
 

203
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,910
strategy okay define
sum of bsts

204
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:05,920
sum of bsts
 

205
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,429
sum of bsts
let's do it a and b okay i want some

206
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:09,439
let's do it a and b okay i want some
 

207
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,149
let's do it a and b okay i want some
missing here

208
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:10,159
missing here
 

209
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,270
missing here
column okay okay and and

210
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:13,280
column okay okay and and
 

211
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,869
column okay okay and and
of course we have we need to have a

212
00:04:14,869 --> 00:04:14,879
of course we have we need to have a
 

213
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,629
of course we have we need to have a
target t okay

214
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:18,639

 

215
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,950

if a is now

216
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:22,960
if a is now
 

217
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,710
if a is now
or b is now what does it mean

218
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:26,720
or b is now what does it mean
 

219
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,870
or b is now what does it mean
if one or three is empty you so we can't

220
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:28,880
if one or three is empty you so we can't
 

221
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,469
if one or three is empty you so we can't
pick two notes

222
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:30,479
pick two notes
 

223
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:37,030
pick two notes
right little force whether yes

224
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:37,040

 

225
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,230

okay now if a top value

226
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:40,240
okay now if a top value
 

227
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,469
okay now if a top value
plus dot value equals t

228
00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:44,479
plus dot value equals t
 

229
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:51,270
plus dot value equals t
we found it

230
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:51,280

 

231
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,110

okay now we need to compare if a value

232
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:55,120
okay now we need to compare if a value
 

233
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,390
okay now we need to compare if a value
plus speed of value if it's smaller okay

234
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:58,400
plus speed of value if it's smaller okay
 

235
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,830
plus speed of value if it's smaller okay
if it's smaller than target yeah

236
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:01,840
if it's smaller than target yeah
 

237
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,950
if it's smaller than target yeah
if it's smaller than target we go to the

238
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:04,960
if it's smaller than target we go to the
 

239
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,590
if it's smaller than target we go to the
right

240
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:05,600
right
 

241
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,469
right
smaller than the target so we need to go

242
00:05:08,469 --> 00:05:08,479
smaller than the target so we need to go
 

243
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,510
smaller than the target so we need to go
there two cases

244
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:09,520
there two cases
 

245
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,710
there two cases
so then we can say return yeah return

246
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:12,720
so then we can say return yeah return
 

247
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,230
so then we can say return yeah return
okay let's let's let's make this simple

248
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:16,240
okay let's let's let's make this simple
 

249
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,990
okay let's let's let's make this simple
okay without writing too much let's do

250
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:18,000
okay without writing too much let's do
 

251
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,510
okay without writing too much let's do
it let's make it f

252
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:19,520
it let's make it f
 

253
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,830
it let's make it f
f function right the function name f

254
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:22,840
f function right the function name f
 

255
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:28,150
f function right the function name f
function now we can do this f

256
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:28,160

 

257
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,550

move to the right so a top

258
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:32,560

 

259
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,430

right yeah and then b

260
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:37,440
right yeah and then b
 

261
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,749
right yeah and then b
t or f

262
00:05:41,749 --> 00:05:41,759
t or f
 

263
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,670
t or f
a b dot right all right

264
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:45,680
a b dot right all right
 

265
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,870
a b dot right all right
do you understand this t yeah

266
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:48,880
do you understand this t yeah
 

267
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,110
do you understand this t yeah
does this make sense so you could be

268
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:51,120
does this make sense so you could be
 

269
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,070
does this make sense so you could be
only into

270
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:52,080
only into
 

271
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,550
only into
these two cases right yeah we don't need

272
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:54,560
these two cases right yeah we don't need
 

273
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,070
these two cases right yeah we don't need
to search for the left tree

274
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:56,080
to search for the left tree
 

275
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,110
to search for the left tree
because it will be smaller got it

276
00:05:59,110 --> 00:05:59,120
because it will be smaller got it
 

277
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,189
because it will be smaller got it
yeah yeah yeah yeah and as

278
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:03,199
yeah yeah yeah yeah and as
 

279
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,230
yeah yeah yeah yeah and as
there is no b1 that will be a

280
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:06,240
there is no b1 that will be a
 

281
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,710
there is no b1 that will be a
top value plus speed of value is one

282
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:08,720
top value plus speed of value is one
 

283
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,590
top value plus speed of value is one
larger than t

284
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:09,600
larger than t
 

285
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,790
larger than t
right all right it's larger than c so

286
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:12,800
right all right it's larger than c so
 

287
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,870
right all right it's larger than c so
what's this what's here

288
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:14,880
what's this what's here
 

289
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,309
what's this what's here
return f

290
00:06:18,309 --> 00:06:18,319
return f
 

291
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,309
return f
if it's larger then we want the smaller

292
00:06:20,309 --> 00:06:20,319
if it's larger then we want the smaller
 

293
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,749
if it's larger then we want the smaller
ones

294
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:21,759
ones
 

295
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:31,990
ones
now what should i put here

296
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,000

 

297
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,390

well the smaller one left left

298
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:36,400
well the smaller one left left
 

299
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,830
well the smaller one left left
and then one b

300
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:39,840
and then one b
 

301
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,950
and then one b
dot do we need the o

302
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:42,960
dot do we need the o
 

303
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,110
dot do we need the o
no b b t because

304
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:47,120
no b b t because
 

305
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,150
no b b t because
because we either go uh

306
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:50,160
because we either go uh
 

307
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,390
because we either go uh
navigate to one of the sub trees that's

308
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:52,400
navigate to one of the sub trees that's
 

309
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,510
navigate to one of the sub trees that's
true we don't need to

310
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:53,520
true we don't need to
 

311
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,710
true we don't need to
navigate too right or there's another

312
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:56,720
navigate too right or there's another
 

313
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,230
navigate too right or there's another
cases or

314
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:58,240
cases or
 

315
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,070
cases or
f a

316
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,080
f a
 

317
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,670
f a
right no no no we go

318
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:05,680
right no no no we go
 

319
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,270
right no no no we go
look b a come on b

320
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:09,280
look b a come on b
 

321
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,550
look b a come on b
right b left yeah and t so

322
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:12,560
right b left yeah and t so
 

323
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,990
right b left yeah and t so
does it make sense yeah look look

324
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:16,000
does it make sense yeah look look
 

325
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,029
does it make sense yeah look look
again again

326
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:19,039

 

327
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,830

okay so if something is smaller it's

328
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:21,840
okay so if something is smaller it's
 

329
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,950
okay so if something is smaller it's
something smaller

330
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:22,960
something smaller
 

331
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,230
something smaller
it then we can call this function to go

332
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:26,240
it then we can call this function to go
 

333
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,270
it then we can call this function to go
to the left so

334
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:27,280
to the left so
 

335
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,469
to the left so
it will be this one and this one oh

336
00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:30,479
it will be this one and this one oh
 

337
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,309
it will be this one and this one oh
oh what all this one

338
00:07:34,309 --> 00:07:34,319
oh what all this one
 

339
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,589
oh what all this one
and this one together

340
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:37,599
and this one together
 

341
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,029
and this one together
doesn't make sense yeah

342
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:41,039
doesn't make sense yeah
 

343
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,150
doesn't make sense yeah
so because look because these two are

344
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:44,160
so because look because these two are
 

345
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,790
so because look because these two are
bigger so we want smaller so how can we

346
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:46,800
bigger so we want smaller so how can we
 

347
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,230
bigger so we want smaller so how can we
move smaller we move

348
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:48,240
move smaller we move
 

349
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,070
move smaller we move
this one to the left yeah

350
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,080
this one to the left yeah
 

351
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,110
this one to the left yeah
or all this one to the left but not both

352
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:55,120
or all this one to the left but not both
 

353
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,150
or all this one to the left but not both
all right maybe both but

354
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:58,160
all right maybe both but
 

355
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,950
all right maybe both but
but recursively we only deal with one at

356
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:00,960
but recursively we only deal with one at
 

357
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,430
but recursively we only deal with one at
a time

358
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:01,440
a time
 

359
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:10,550
a time
okay what's the term complexity

360
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:10,560

 

361
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,430

because in the worst case in the worst

362
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:13,440
because in the worst case in the worst
 

363
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,029
because in the worst case in the worst
case we need to find

364
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:17,039

 

365
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,110

exactly how you know how what's the

366
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:19,120
exactly how you know how what's the
 

367
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,869
exactly how you know how what's the
worst case what's the worst case i tell

368
00:08:20,869 --> 00:08:20,879
worst case what's the worst case i tell
 

369
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:21,670
worst case what's the worst case i tell
you okay

370
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:21,680
you okay
 

371
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,629
you okay
for example it's false no you'll be like

372
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:24,639
for example it's false no you'll be like
 

373
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:25,029
for example it's false no you'll be like
that

374
00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:25,039
that
 

375
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,670
that
will be a little bit like that

376
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:29,680
will be a little bit like that
 

377
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,070
will be a little bit like that
okay okay so oh like if this is

378
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:34,080
okay okay so oh like if this is
 

379
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,190
okay okay so oh like if this is
if this is one zero minus one

380
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:37,200
if this is one zero minus one
 

381
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,029
if this is one zero minus one
minus two one zero minus one minus two

382
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:41,039
minus two one zero minus one minus two
 

383
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,470
minus two one zero minus one minus two
if i tell you that i want uh a value

384
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:44,480
if i tell you that i want uh a value
 

385
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:44,870
if i tell you that i want uh a value
which

386
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:44,880
which
 

387
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,550
which
is sum up to minus four

388
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:48,560
is sum up to minus four
 

389
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,829
is sum up to minus four
okay so now one plus one smaller

390
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:51,839
okay so now one plus one smaller
 

391
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,030
okay so now one plus one smaller
yeah so i got this one yeah

392
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:55,040
yeah so i got this one yeah
 

393
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,949
yeah so i got this one yeah
one still soon

394
00:08:58,949 --> 00:08:58,959

 

395
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,030

two is bigger than we need to go to the

396
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:01,040
two is bigger than we need to go to the
 

397
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,070
two is bigger than we need to go to the
left yeah say

398
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:02,080
left yeah say
 

399
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,350
left yeah say
that's smaller again

400
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:05,360
that's smaller again
 

401
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,310
that's smaller again
smaller smaller yeah and this doesn't

402
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:08,320
smaller smaller yeah and this doesn't
 

403
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,030
smaller smaller yeah and this doesn't
work out right or and then this one

404
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,040
work out right or and then this one
 

405
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,230
work out right or and then this one
zero yellow smaller smaller

406
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:14,240
zero yellow smaller smaller
 

407
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,509
zero yellow smaller smaller
looks smaller so so

408
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:17,519
looks smaller so so
 

409
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,949
looks smaller so so
oh minus three minus two

410
00:09:20,949 --> 00:09:20,959
oh minus three minus two
 

411
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,230
oh minus three minus two
yeah minus two minus okay so wait

412
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:24,240
yeah minus two minus okay so wait
 

413
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,269
yeah minus two minus okay so wait
could in the worst case could be o a

414
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:27,279
could in the worst case could be o a
 

415
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:27,910
could in the worst case could be o a
times b

416
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:27,920
times b
 

417
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,750
times b
i was thinking because how many times

418
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:29,760
i was thinking because how many times
 

419
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,430
i was thinking because how many times
you're iterating

420
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:33,440

 

421
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,269

look one

422
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:37,279
look one
 

423
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,630
look one
one one it doesn't find it you only need

424
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:40,640
one one it doesn't find it you only need
 

425
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,350
one one it doesn't find it you only need
the smaller

426
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:41,360
the smaller
 

427
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,760
the smaller
one zero yeah

428
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:43,770
one zero yeah
 

429
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:45,269

still smaller still smaller still

432
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:47,680
still smaller still smaller still
 

433
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,190
still smaller still smaller still
smaller yeah

434
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:49,200
smaller yeah
 

435
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,630
smaller yeah
yeah oh there'll be one and this one

436
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:52,640
yeah oh there'll be one and this one
 

437
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,750
yeah oh there'll be one and this one
okay so it's smaller

438
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:55,760
okay so it's smaller
 

439
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,110
okay so it's smaller
it's smaller than smaller smaller

440
00:09:59,110 --> 00:09:59,120
it's smaller than smaller smaller
 

441
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,590
it's smaller than smaller smaller
yeah smaller smaller smaller smaller

442
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:03,600
yeah smaller smaller smaller smaller
 

443
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,150
yeah smaller smaller smaller smaller
so actually it's r a times b in the

444
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:06,160
so actually it's r a times b in the
 

445
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,030
so actually it's r a times b in the
worst case

446
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:07,040
worst case
 

447
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,389
worst case
time b yes yeah

448
00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:10,399
time b yes yeah
 

449
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,310
time b yes yeah
this makes sense in the worst case it's

450
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:12,320
this makes sense in the worst case it's
 

451
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,069
this makes sense in the worst case it's
a times o a times b

452
00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:14,079
a times o a times b
 

453
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:27,950
a times o a times b
uh what's the space complexity

454
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:27,960

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,949

or you you don't need the air so you

458
00:10:32,949 --> 00:10:32,959
or you you don't need the air so you
 

459
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,470
or you you don't need the air so you
just return it just normally a little

460
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:34,480
just return it just normally a little
 

461
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:34,790
just return it just normally a little
bit

462
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:34,800
bit
 

463
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,550
bit
here it's the same because when you

464
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:36,560
here it's the same because when you
 

465
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,069
here it's the same because when you
return you can't go further

466
00:10:38,069 --> 00:10:38,079
return you can't go further
 

467
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:39,829
return you can't go further
do you get it in a function when you

468
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:39,839
do you get it in a function when you
 

469
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,990
do you get it in a function when you
return for example in return
