1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:03,299
right

2
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:11,340
so just imagine we have a great

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,219
n times n great

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:16,859
not a loopy Q right yeah

5
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:18,960
this is one times one times one

6
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,480
for example if this number is one that

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,880
means I put one Cube here if you look at

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,220
Infinity wave

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:30,180
how can I draw it because it's like a

10
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:32,460
solar panel so look this is a two degree

11
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:34,579
a little bit Q right can you give me a

12
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,960
loopy kill okay

13
00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:37,770
thank you yeah yeah this is perfect this

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,260
is

15
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,239
[Music]

16
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:44,820
like last time okay this is one times

17
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,340
one times one that's a great yeah turn

18
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:50,460
it this way

19
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:53,460
okay so if this is one so it means

20
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:56,699
actual one here if this is two

21
00:00:53,460 --> 00:01:00,600
I mean I put this one two on top right

22
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:03,059
if this is three I put three skills one

23
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,060
two three make sense

24
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:08,220
okay okay so

25
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:10,560
so let's say if I just put one Cube on

26
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:13,920
that how many surface how many surface

27
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:18,119
service is that six six good counting

28
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:21,060
the top and bottom as well okay so if I

29
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:23,939
put two cubes on top of each other so

30
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:27,780
one Cube here how many surface

31
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:29,939
do you count these two as one or two

32
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,820
or two question yes two but yeah without

33
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:35,340
the surface they they're the same like

34
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,619
levels yeah yeah but it's different but

35
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:41,700
the thing is that internal one right if

36
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:44,640
we have another Cube on Top This surface

37
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,860
and the surface of another do you have

38
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,259
another one are you sure it's better to

39
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:51,240
have the same size the cube so I can I

40
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:53,780
can draw I'm not very good at drawing

41
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,780
but if you have

42
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:00,600
like this is this good enough that's

43
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,280
good that's good okay okay so yeah I

44
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,320
will have six which is one time so I

45
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:08,399
remember all the cubes is one one okay

46
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,440
this is yeah no this is two but this if

47
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,780
you count these substitute is six and

48
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,120
this is basically the same but with it

49
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,520
yeah okay okay yeah you understand okay

50
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,760
so look how many surface

51
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,800
first six how many surface how many

52
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:27,360
services that's right yeah because these

53
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:30,360
two are gone right okay yeah okay

54
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,360
look

55
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,540
they're very one two three four so

56
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,780
they're eight right

57
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:42,060
yeah eight and then nine ten okay that

58
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,860
was mine that one's Eric's so if I put

59
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,120
another one on top you know how to do it

60
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,660
right

61
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,660
okay

62
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:54,379
okay

63
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,060
so how many surfaces if you put it uh

64
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:03,060
horizontal each other

65
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:05,519
one two the same the same yeah the same

66
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:08,280
okay so how many service if you put

67
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,380
another one up here

68
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,500
um

69
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:16,760
[Music]

70
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,760
like this

71
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,459
like this

72
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,260
exactly yes

73
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:28,700
how many service

74
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:28,700
ten minus one

75
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,720
Plus

76
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:35,940
is it 14. we want to call the surface

77
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,540
for example like if I put one Cube here

78
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:42,480
two cubes here

79
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:45,480
thank you okay one kill here

80
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,659
one kill here two kill here how many

81
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:51,959
servings okay how many surface

82
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:55,140
you can't how many uh so one two three

83
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:57,480
four five six seven eight nine ten

84
00:03:55,140 --> 00:04:00,420
eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen

85
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:03,379
sixteen sixteen how do you calculate

86
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,379
this wait

87
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,760
we know

88
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:08,239
[Music]

89
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,239
yeah

90
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:18,239
no that is ten yes and then we add one

91
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:20,880
on top this one surf is like this is

92
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:26,220
gone Okay so

93
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:29,180
and then we have five okay yeah is it

94
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:33,479
five there's five surfaces left

95
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:36,000
so is so is nine plus five it's not it's

96
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:39,540
not ten because this one is gone

97
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,419
okay okay interesting okay so okay so

98
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:44,400
you know this one this is six right

99
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:50,580
yeah

100
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:52,380
and these is ten all right yeah and this

101
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:55,080
is

102
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:57,380
fourteen three times four one two three

103
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,280
four five okay

104
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:03,199
yeah so

105
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,199
if if they are n how many

106
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,020
yeah

107
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:09,259
okay I told me this because it's too

108
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,259
much

109
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,360
this is

110
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:21,479
this is

111
00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:22,460
yeah it's basically okay so if they are

112
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:25,560
cute

113
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:28,800
and cute what's the formula if n cubes

114
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:31,259
what's what's the service I need one the

115
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,539
answer is six n equals two the answer is

116
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:36,860
ten n equals three the answer is

117
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:36,860
fourteen the N is four

118
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:46,380
yes so how do we know it's adding four

119
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:49,800
so you always have this the top one and

120
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:52,199
the bottom one and you always add

121
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:55,380
yes

122
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:57,660
one top one bottom and you have more of

123
00:05:55,380 --> 00:06:01,380
these how many how many of these which

124
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:03,300
is Hawaii four four around yes four

125
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:04,560
around so what's left what's that it's n

126
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,560
what's the number

127
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,560
foreign

128
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,740
cubes

129
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,520
so how many surface does it contribute

130
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,720
four times eight cubes right this is the

131
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,419
formula right

132
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:31,259
we are n cubes in the service

133
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:33,479
is four times n plus top and bottom

134
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:35,639
how about by putting together to each

135
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:38,400
other horizontally like the here is one

136
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:40,080
and here let's do

137
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,520
something you know this right you know

138
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,380
how to calculate this one at a time

139
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,660
right one at a time if I think putting

140
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:47,880
together is it 14. yeah I'm not looking

141
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:49,860
for a exact number I'm just looking for

142
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:53,460
the how do we get it it doesn't need to

143
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:55,560
tell me that because we know those two

144
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:59,880
ten

145
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:03,660
since we know uh we didn't know a cube

146
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:06,240
has six surfaces to connect it to the

147
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:09,199
other part when it connects the

148
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,199
intersection

149
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:16,680
so it's subtract one surface like there

150
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:19,380
yeah subtract you'll mentioned a good

151
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:22,800
point subtract okay look I'm putting the

152
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:25,560
cubes here right put a lot of kills

153
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:29,039
if we look at each number you know

154
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:31,440
vertically right this is two cubes yeah

155
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:34,380
this is two cubed this is five cubes we

156
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,479
know how to get it service individually

157
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:38,580
on its own right but the thing is that

158
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,380
when you put it together like this is

159
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:42,900
one putting one here and this is two

160
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:45,120
here so they are internet they are

161
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:48,240
connecting we need to minus subtract

162
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,759
this part MRI yes

163
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,740
so we know how to subtract right how

164
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:55,500
many look here this is one this is two

165
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:58,139
so how many surface we need to subtract

166
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,419
just imagine here like one thing the one

167
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:01,860
to the two yeah yeah it's one here is

168
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:04,500
two now how many surface we need to

169
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:07,680
subtract two yes because you put two

170
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:09,479
together is two right so okay if they

171
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,520
are

172
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:13,740
three here and there are two here how

173
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:18,620
many service do we need to subtract four

174
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:18,620
yeah so how do we get a four I counted

175
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,500
oh

176
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:45,350
from

177
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:45,350
[Music]

178
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:53,760
nowhere you said this is small yes

179
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,700
you're all right okay how about yeah how

180
00:08:53,760 --> 00:09:00,940
about this is three how many service

181
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:00,940
[Music]

182
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:09,839
you can come yeah okay one no one two

183
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:13,459
three four five six seven why is it

184
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:16,740
seven no I mean subtract to subtract oh

185
00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:19,440
subtract I I think this bit I added this

186
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:21,600
bit and I need to subtract this I just

187
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,440
asked you how many I need to subtract

188
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,440
this

189
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,820
okay okay

190
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:35,220
ah okay I see what you mean no no okay

191
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:37,380
so uh yeah my questions are not very

192
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:39,660
clear okay so what I meant is that we

193
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:42,000
already know these according to that

194
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:44,640
right so this is how many three is

195
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,980
fourteen right fourteen right am I right

196
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:50,220
yeah fourteen

197
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:52,860
service of this clip plus 14 of service

198
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:54,420
so this week but they are common parts

199
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,339
in the middle which we shouldn't config

200
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:58,860
we need to minus something so how many

201
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:59,959
we need to mind the minimum yes it's a

202
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:03,720
minimum

203
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:05,760
and isn't it the towers uh minus one

204
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,420
because three minus one is two and

205
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,420
there's two there

206
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:14,040
no I just will say this bit this bit

207
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:16,279
yeah this bit yeah no so how many of

208
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,279
these

209
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,760
power minimum there are three towers

210
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:23,339
here there are three towers out here so

211
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:26,880
how many I need to subtract from 14 plus

212
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:30,740
14. two of each right one two three four

213
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,740
five six you need substance six right

214
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:34,560
easy times three times two right doesn't

215
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:37,019
make sense

216
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,060
okay so here a hundred here is a hundred

217
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:41,040
imagine this is a hundred this is 200

218
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:42,899
how many I need to subtract subtract

219
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,240
okay just this paid just this common

220
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:48,440
part how many I need to subtract

221
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,440
is it 200

222
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:54,839
and 532 how many I need to subtract

223
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:56,760
[Music]

224
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:58,500
that's right yes that's what I want to

225
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,600
hear okay so this is Horizon mentally

226
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:03,240
right look listen I'm considering here

227
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,459
one here too now I need to subtract this

228
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:08,579
bit right yeah the minimum of it okay

229
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:09,839
okay so now here two and four I need to

230
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:12,360
do the same right

231
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:15,720
this is vertically and this is

232
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:17,700
horizontally yes yes yes but this is the

233
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,380
three dimensional just imagine this is a

234
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,360
three dimensional I put a one Cube here

235
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:23,519
I put a two Cube on top of here I put

236
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,320
the two Cube on top here I know the

237
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,959
contribution for each color right each

238
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,880
top you place a formula right but I need

239
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:31,620
to subtract this common part right these

240
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:35,420
are hidden these are hidden all right

241
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:35,420
this makes sense now if

242
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:54,360
and for this Edge combat Edge right if

243
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,700
there's a number above it

244
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:59,100
then I need to subtract this part if

245
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:01,079
it's a lumber on the left then I need to

246
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:03,260
subtract this part right

247
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:05,760
We compare the minimum

248
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:09,360
okay so now is three towers

249
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,760
three towers I need to subtract six yeah

250
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,519
two dollars I need to subtract

251
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,140
four okay so how many I need to Snapchat

252
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:19,380
here

253
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:22,500
how many I need to subtract here

254
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:24,440
how many I need to subject here yeah how

255
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:27,240
many I need to subscribe here

256
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:29,940
how many ironies are there

257
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:32,640
eight yeah yeah well done now you get it

258
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:34,860
yeah so the idea is to add it all

259
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:37,079
together and subtract these three speed

260
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:40,860
has two sides either on the top or on

261
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:42,560
the left F and answer at the beginning

262
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:46,260
is yellow

263
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,579
fourth row in range

264
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:51,240
and

265
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:54,480
for column in range

266
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:58,639
and this is liquid Okay g okay now

267
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:01,880
answer plus equal G

268
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:06,980
r c

269
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:06,980
this is the number right and

270
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:13,320
the contribution is this one times four

271
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:16,560
plus two if R is bigger than zero we

272
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:18,779
need to minus subtract if a row if it's

273
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,820
from the second row right

274
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:24,120
this is ah

275
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:26,100
this is C if it's from the second row I

276
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:30,120
need to subtract this common part from

277
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:32,880
here all right answer minus equals the

278
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:39,740
minimum of G

279
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:39,740
R C and G R minus 1C

280
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:44,180
times what's the number here

281
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:48,660
yes and if

282
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:51,420
if it's

283
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:55,800
the second column to the right you see

284
00:13:51,420 --> 00:14:01,680
bigger than zero answer minus equal mean

285
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:04,320
G R C and G are C minus one right C

286
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,519
minus one is the number on the left and

287
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,220
times

288
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:12,180
two and return

289
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:14,639
answer I I give you this to count

290
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:16,860
it's hard right it's hard to imagine you

291
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,740
need to count but the idea becomes

292
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:21,360
simple if we add the contribution for

293
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:24,240
nqs

294
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:27,060
color Harmony service

295
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:30,180
is n times four plus two

296
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:33,779
plus two plus one here plus one here if

297
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:37,079
we add these but we also need to get rid

298
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:39,899
of the common parts right so the common

299
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:42,240
path here this is three this is four how

300
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:44,820
many we need to subtract six

301
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,279
sticks for here and how many minutes are

302
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:49,079
here

303
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:53,820
and square easy

304
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:57,360
n Square o n Square n times n o n Square

305
00:14:53,820 --> 00:15:01,199
o n where n is the number of the

306
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,540
of the sales in this grid okay so what

307
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:06,360
have you learned today

308
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:06,959
about this uh we have

309
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,199
um

310
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:13,980
this platform for cubes to go on yeah

311
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:16,320
kids and we want to count we want to

312
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:18,800
count the surfaces number of services

313
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,779
number of services

314
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:25,020
and what's the idea how do we do it

315
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:28,149
what's the idea counts so

316
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:28,149
[Music]

317
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:38,399
common common part which is which is

318
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:40,860
which is the minimum times two minimum

319
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:43,019
times two yeah so look at here minimum

320
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:45,000
is one and one minimum is one times two

321
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:46,980
because here is one here is one times

322
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,620
two okay if there are another one here

323
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:52,440
minimum is still one right it's times

324
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:54,199
two okay so the idea is that to add the

325
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:58,620
numbers

326
00:15:54,199 --> 00:16:01,740
this is uh six plus six minus

327
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,639
two make sense yeah this is the idea

328
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:05,699
okay

329
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:08,420
okay that's it for today bye-bye bye bye

330
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:08,420
bye
