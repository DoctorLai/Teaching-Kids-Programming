1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:06,960
hello miss how are you today

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,120
okay so you play chess right oh yeah

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,599
okay well not really not really okay

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,960
that's fine so we have a chessboard

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:18,800
chess ball you know with the

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:21,279
empty stairs and with the

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,000
knight and one king let's say we have

8
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:26,560
one king here okay only one team

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,240
only one king okay but there could be

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,160
many many

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,679
many many

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,719
many nights

13
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,559
okay uh night yeah you know the night

14
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,280
you know what's nice

15
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:43,040
it's like a soldier or something

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,040
and riding on a horse right

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,280
yeah yeah yeah yeah so tonight yeah like

18
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,239
that

19
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,239
the whole horse

20
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,160
okay i don't know how to draw yeah with

21
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,160
the salt okay

22
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,040
okay

23
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,799
so let's let's use the

24
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,080
edge

25
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:19,680
yeah because it would be horse h

26
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,680
at g so it could be

27
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,560
2h

28
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,560
3h here

29
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,560
okay

30
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,920
wow okay okay that's very abstract blah

31
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,000
blah blah okay

32
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,640
okay

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,640
yeah yeah yeah yeah

34
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,840
you call it horse come on

35
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,360
okay okay

36
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,439
yeah yeah yeah okay

37
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,200
so you know the horse

38
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,399
in chinese chest how do we move the

39
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,280
horse

40
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,280
where can this jump

41
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,360
we're done okay so basically the

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,079
if this is x

43
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,079
this is y right the offset

44
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:05,040
of x to be one

45
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,880
y could be two or x equals two y could

46
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,479
be one right so it could be like you

47
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,239
know in one step

48
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,360
to the right and two step

49
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,239
right to that to the north right

50
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,480
okay

51
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,480
so

52
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,360
they hope they have

53
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,440
three

54
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,160
and how many moves what's the minimum

55
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:27,599
number of moves in order for any of the

56
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,520
horses to capture the king one

57
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,680
yeah wear them okay and how about if i

58
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:36,280
don't have this

59
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,280
how many what's the minimum move

60
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,959
yeah too yeah

61
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,280
yeah okay you got it yeah because look

62
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,560
this one in order to capture these it's

63
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,560
how many moves it requires

64
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:51,900
[Music]

65
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,440
one two

66
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,159
now one two three okay four moves okay

67
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,840
four moves for this one is one two

68
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:06,239
okay make sense

69
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,239
yeah so today's task we only we have one

70
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,040
king on the board

71
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,959
yeah

72
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,440
this is a lego metric we can represent

73
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:16,840
this as a matrix two dimensional metric

74
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,400
in python and where zero is empty

75
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,120
okay

76
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,480
one is king

77
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,519
two is the knight okay nine or horse egg

78
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,000
knight

79
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,000
or hot

80
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,879
so we want to find out the task is that

81
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,360
we want to find out the minimum number

82
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,480
of moves for some knights to capture the

83
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,480
king

84
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,840
the horse cannot jump on the horse for

85
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,239
example if there

86
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,760
is a knight here for this one you cannot

87
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,560
jump here

88
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,480
right make sense yeah because this

89
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,519
this place is already occupied by

90
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:54,239
another

91
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,239
knight another horse right makes sense

92
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,159
what's your question yeah you've got a

93
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,599
question

94
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,879
sorry

95
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,319
you don't have a question okay that's

96
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,439
why you understand what i'm talking

97
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,799
about right

98
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,280
so we want to find out the minimum

99
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,799
number of moves for some horse to

100
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,200
capture the king

101
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,759
okay so that's pretty simple

102
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,919
if there's only one horse

103
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,919
yeah if there's only one horse let's

104
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:24,240
don't look at this

105
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,000
what's your approach to capture a king

106
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,000
if there's only one horse if we want to

107
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,680
find out the minimum

108
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,680
we can do what kind of search

109
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,240
what kind of search can we do come on

110
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,320
breakfast search weather why is the

111
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,120
breakfast search look look

112
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,800
here you have your house here right your

113
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,160
horse here and then the next move you

114
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,800
can jump another to here here

115
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,639
how many how many

116
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,840
how many notes are there for the second

117
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,840
for the next move for the in ideally how

118
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,000
many of these what's the maximum number

119
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,240
of move for the next move where down

120
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,240
eight okay a move yeah because if you

121
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,600
are here you could have a direction okay

122
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:08,160
so so like if any of these is

123
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,600
the move will be capturing the king

124
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,199
then we find a

125
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,520
shortcase yeah well

126
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,840
for the preference search you use

127
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,800
usually can be used to solve the

128
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,800
shortest right because that's the way i

129
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,479
travel the tree

130
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,759
level by level

131
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,880
right

132
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,639
am i right

133
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,240
so when i reached the

134
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,120
note for a number here

135
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,440
at least it's the king

136
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,880
if i found here and i already know like

137
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,199
like two moves right

138
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,919
because i always explain the levels by

139
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,520
level and when i visit it when i visit

140
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,160
the king

141
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,080
it's always the guarantee the shortest

142
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,840
make sense

143
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,080
but definite search may not give the

144
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,479
idea right because look if devastate

145
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,280
could be somewhere here this came over

146
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,319
here

147
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,000
right when you get the king

148
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:01,280
it may not be the optimum right you

149
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,360
could maybe take 10 moves

150
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,880
you need to travel all the trees and

151
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,280
compare this

152
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,199
the moves to get the minimum but for the

153
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,960
preferred search is when i found the

154
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,960
first king

155
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,120
it's it's already the shortest because

156
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,039
i'll travel the trees level by level

157
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,639
it's guaranteed that's your taste the

158
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,800
different search

159
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,600
not the ultimate you have to travel the

160
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,880
entire tree because look yeah you may

161
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,960
find a king

162
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,240
yeah by the by following this path

163
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,080
somehow

164
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,240
yeah you might have a king here

165
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,400
but you don't know there may be some

166
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,280
shorties cars here right this is the

167
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,440
optimal when you find a king

168
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,680
you have to remember it okay so i take

169
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,600
10 moves here okay i take three moves

170
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:47,280
here so the strategy is three months

171
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:49,039
that's two minutes okay one two okay

172
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,680
yeah make sense

173
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:54,080
so look there are many many edge many

174
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,000
many edge yeah you know you already we

175
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,759
already know how to solve this problem

176
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,599
using preferences if there's one edge

177
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,599
one horse but how about many many edge

178
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,599
we can repeat this

179
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,000
as many times as possible right

180
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:10,160
yeah even our energy we can do it look

181
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,280
we can do this one one solution blue

182
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,400
force yeah

183
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,960
is that we try for each edge we

184
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,880
calculate the minimum number of moves to

185
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,000
add k and we get the

186
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,360
minimum

187
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,360
number yeah so you'll be like four

188
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:30,639
h in all hot in all asia

189
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:34,960
and in order as this is on edge now we

190
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,960
do this answer equals mean

191
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,639
answer and then prefer search okay

192
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,120
question search

193
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,759
i start with this edge right

194
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:47,120
and then return answer okay this is one

195
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,560
way to prove something yeah make sense

196
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,560
make sense

197
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,039
yeah look because we already know how to

198
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,599
solve the one problem what one king from

199
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:58,160
one horse to one king

200
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:00,319
the source to the destination and we can

201
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,319
repeat this

202
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:05,680
h times if there are n

203
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:08,560
n horses we can repeat this n times

204
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,160
but this this is not optimal why is that

205
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,520
because look uh

206
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,240
let's take a

207
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,160
complexity for example if these the how

208
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,840
do what's the complexity travel from

209
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,080
source to king

210
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:24,080
yeah it's n

211
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:25,360
it's and if they are look if

212
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,759
um

213
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,879
if there are n

214
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:34,240
n rows and columns yeah if this is the

215
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,240
n rows and columns

216
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:40,560
okay so ideally n rows and columns and

217
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,640
we can visualize this as a graph right

218
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,519
we can visualize this as well so this

219
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,080
edge

220
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,000
uh you know can points to

221
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,080
the vertex this is the vertex this is

222
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,120
the vertex at different this is edge

223
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,360
edge

224
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,440
f and different vertices yeah they are n

225
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,000
times n square

226
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:02,080
vertex and square vertices

227
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,600
right then how how many edges are there

228
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,600
i don't know

229
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,360
how many edges

230
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,200
how many edges for three inverted how

231
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,920
many edges for

232
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,160
the four vertex do you still remember

233
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,160
this

234
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:21,160
this still remember this

235
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,160
now let's

236
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,519
so if there are n vertices what's that

237
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:31,519
if there are vertex and vertex

238
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:33,360
how many how many edges possible

239
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:37,120
look remember a few days ago we talked

240
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:39,920
about if that the first vertex

241
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:43,440
has edges to n minus one

242
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:45,360
a minus one times n minus two y

243
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,480
times n minus two yeah

244
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:51,600
one yeah okay so let's not let's

245
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,320
let's consider they are n cells okay not

246
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,680
n rows and columns they are n

247
00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:00,320
and s and vertex and possible partitions

248
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,839
and the number of vertex is

249
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,399
n times

250
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:08,160
uh because the first one is n minus one

251
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:10,480
n times uh n minus one times n minus two

252
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,160
times minus three times one right so

253
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,600
you'll be n

254
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:17,040
minus one

255
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,720
plus one times n minus one

256
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,440
divided by 2. this is the number of

257
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:25,040
possible edges so this is n so

258
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:27,440
the number of possible edges is and and

259
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,000
yeah this this one is linear in the

260
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,560
order of n squared right in the order of

261
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,160
square if there are n cells and possible

262
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,279
partitions there and

263
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,240
square

264
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:40,240
edges right so that means that because

265
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,320
we only travel the same

266
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,600
we can use the hash map to hash side to

267
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,839
remember the

268
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,680
possible partition we travel right so if

269
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,200
i travel from here to here the next time

270
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,040
if i come back look

271
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,480
if i come back i don't travel again

272
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,800
again right because this has been

273
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,680
visited yeah we use the notebook

274
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,320
map

275
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,640
yeah so the time complexity to travel

276
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,800
from a source a source a pair of source

277
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,680
to the destination is n square right

278
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,959
because only they are possible n square

279
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,440
n square

280
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:11,120
n square n to the power of two edges and

281
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:15,200
then we travel

282
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,320
use n square and if they are if they

283
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,839
n

284
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,120
horses the time term lets you n times n

285
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,440
square right

286
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:27,040
at least m yeah could be

287
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:29,040
filled in these so the time in order of

288
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:32,079
the possible partition so the time

289
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:34,079
complexity is actually and qb right the

290
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:36,000
time complexity we're using we're using

291
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:39,120
the queue we're using the hashmap

292
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,200
so it's all in order of our n right

293
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,800
got it but can we do better can we do

294
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,920
better

295
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,560
maybe

296
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,480
look we in in order to

297
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,079
shorten the term we don't need to repeat

298
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,360
this

299
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:55,040
m time right we can put these m sources

300
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,880
together at the beginning into the

301
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,480
preference search so look the

302
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,720
preferences usually start with a

303
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,639
position right but we can start a set in

304
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,519
a set of positions

305
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:08,240
right we can look if there are five five

306
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,440
h here right i can put this five edge in

307
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,519
the queue first

308
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,519
right this this is the

309
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,440
takeaway today

310
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,600
yeah what did i just say this is the

311
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,720
takeaway today yeah what's the previous

312
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,360
one

313
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,360
what did i do

314
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,519
if i have five edges i just put it in

315
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,200
the same in a queue right remember we

316
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,120
use the wndq

317
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:34,399
we put it in a queue in on the right

318
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,399
hand side nq in q we take it all right

319
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,720
yeah we take it out so

320
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,720
instead of doing this

321
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,040
five times

322
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,920
i can put these five partitions into the

323
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,000
queue

324
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,920
and then this is not like a tree anymore

325
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,560
this is like uh

326
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,800
what the least i can travel these

327
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,600
so and each one is a right possibly a

328
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,560
yeah

329
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,800
yeah

330
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,040
so it's still the same

331
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,880
if i found the king here

332
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,639
what does it mean i still find the shot

333
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,399
is smooth right

334
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,720
all right

335
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,560
okay so this is one optimization right

336
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,639
what's your motivation okay so as i said

337
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:15,240
i have many nice one king can you think

338
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,240
reversely you know what's the university

339
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,079
yeah yeah so look instead of instead of

340
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:28,560
going from a course i can go from one

341
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:30,560
i can go from where

342
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,560
yeah look because there's only one king

343
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,800
right so i can go from one king and if i

344
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,639
catch any horses

345
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,480
yeah you'll be yeah

346
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,320
yeah yeah you'll be you'll be the

347
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,360
shortest yeah because the direction the

348
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,519
edges

349
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,440
the graph remember the graph

350
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,560
if there is no direction what would you

351
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,720
call it

352
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,839
if like in a graph we don't have a

353
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:54,639
direction what do you call it

354
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,639
what's this graph

355
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,560
and directional graph yeah underneath

356
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,680
it's the same if you can capture the

357
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,600
king

358
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,680
from this partition to here

359
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,920
surely the king can come can jump

360
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,480
backwards right the king can

361
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:11,120
yeah we we just reverse it it's the

362
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:14,079
problem is the same yeah we can just

363
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,680
reverse these horses as the king

364
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,880
and k

365
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,160
is the

366
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,519
horses uh it's a horses okay

367
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,120
makes sense

368
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,959
so because we have online kings so the

369
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,279
term complexity will be just o n square

370
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:29,680
right instead of o m times n because

371
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:31,440
this could be in order of n

372
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,399
makes sense so we are reducing the time

373
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,279
complexity for o and q b to o n square

374
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,880
right

375
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,880
yeah

376
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:42,959
yeah make sense

377
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:45,600
okay so but as i said look we can we if

378
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:48,720
if we don't do that we can still if we

379
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:51,760
can still append

380
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,600
a plan of horses many horses together to

381
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,360
the kid to the king uh to the queue

382
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,720
right and this is called the marty sauce

383
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,920
breakfast search

384
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:02,959
do you get it multi-source pressure such

385
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:05,760
make sense any question

386
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,760
what did i just say

387
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:14,240
what's my this preference can you tell

388
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:16,320
it's me you use um

389
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,639
lots of lots of starting point yeah

390
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,399
previously we only had one king one one

391
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,360
horse and that's just single sauce

392
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,279
breakfast

393
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,480
but now i have many many plates and i

394
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:27,040
can just do it

395
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,880
okay i will just uh i will just

396
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:31,199
implement this preference search okay

397
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:34,560
it'll be easy on we use the wnbq and how

398
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:36,000
do you define wndq in python

399
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,120
uh

400
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,950
pq

401
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:43,009
and what's q first thing

402
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:43,009
[Music]

403
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:54,639
define let's say

404
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,759
minimum main move let me move and we

405
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,560
have a

406
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:00,560
a board okay at the board

407
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,240
we want the chest bar

408
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,279
right

409
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,880
so

410
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:09,680
q q equal d q

411
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,680
yeah because we we using double ended q

412
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,839
but we are not sure what to put

413
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,000
usually you put a load in binary search

414
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,920
in a binary but we are not sure what to

415
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
put here so let's just initialize with

416
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,959
nothing so it's an empty cube

417
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,920
so now let's say the row

418
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:28,480
columns is we just get the dimension of

419
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,560
the board yeah the number of rows and

420
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,360
the number of columns

421
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,250
yeah

422
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,959
yeah

423
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:37,519
[Music]

424
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:39,759
zero and um zero

425
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,120
so yeah

426
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,040
and

427
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,720
and then we need to go through the ball

428
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,720
to put the

429
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,839
let's start with the king

430
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,720
for

431
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,600
r

432
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,839
in

433
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,079
range

434
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,959
rows

435
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,320
for

436
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:58,240
c in

437
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,560
range

438
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,560
what

439
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,880
what do i play the rows and what what

440
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,600
are these

441
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,600
columns

442
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,839
and then look if

443
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,679
both

444
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:16,720
are c

445
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:19,919
is is okay let's define a

446
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:23,039
constant king equals let's say one

447
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:26,000
uh empty could be zero okay

448
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:27,520
and then the horse on that nine horse

449
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,679
would be

450
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,919
two okay something like that yeah

451
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,240
if ball equals king yeah because we are

452
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:36,160
capturing the king king there's only one

453
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,360
king okay king and then we just append

454
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,880
it kill the apparent

455
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,200
apparent

456
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,200
rc

457
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,440
okay look we push

458
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,360
to coordinate what are these

459
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,919
what do you declare with these

460
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,400
parentheses what are those keyboards

461
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,960
tuple is called tuple okay

462
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,720
okay now

463
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,480
now this is the initialization

464
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,799
initialization we put

465
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,760
put uh we put a

466
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:07,360
king

467
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,360
into the queue yeah into the queue

468
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,160
yeah because we're putting the sources

469
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,840
right if you change because there's only

470
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,360
one king we're putting english one king

471
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,200
if there's only one thing we can break

472
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,360
it here right you can just break

473
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,840
but if you try to

474
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:24,000
append the horses yeah and then you try

475
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,000
to you can change this to horses and do

476
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,840
it reverse way

477
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,840
now this is called multi-source

478
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,600
breakfast search okay multiple surveys

479
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,080
research

480
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,080
so after we we do this after we do this

481
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,400
what should what should we do after we

482
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,799
do this what should we do

483
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,480
and we we can do this breakfast yeah

484
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,400
right so first of all we need to

485
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,039
remember the number of the

486
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,640
remember the positions we have visited

487
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:51,039
so what kind of data structure can we

488
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,039
use to remember that moves

489
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:55,360
uh what what was the thing we could see

490
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:57,840
in equal set yeah

491
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:00,640
okay and then we can say while q is not

492
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,960
empty yeah why the q is not empty now we

493
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,600
uh okay so because we want to remove

494
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,799
remember the how many uh look eric

495
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,120
yeah

496
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:11,600
look we want to remember when we visit

497
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,840
this uh

498
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:16,320
when we visit this is the king and then

499
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,000
we want to visit here horses we also do

500
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,520
we want to return

501
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,559
two moves yeah we want to pretend the

502
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,240
shortest

503
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:25,280
number of moves

504
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,640
so we can because

505
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,880
if we want to remember it there are two

506
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,440
ways of doing it because we can append

507
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,039
the number of moves in a tuple right

508
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,039
that's one way because every time you

509
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:37,200
you can expand you can expand the one

510
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:39,840
node now by node and then you can

511
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,960
remember the number of moves here now

512
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,880
all we

513
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:47,760
as we talked about before we can always

514
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:50,640
what we all we can also always take all

515
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:54,160
the existing numbers uh the nodes in the

516
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,679
queue and then append their children

517
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,160
right we can take we can take these

518
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:00,559
three notes all at once and push their

519
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,600
children back to the queue so in this

520
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:04,240
case

521
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,240
every time i visited all the numbers all

522
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,880
the elements all the positions in the

523
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,760
queue it's all belong to the same level

524
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:14,480
it's the same distance make sense

525
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,559
yeah so let's do the y q and we need to

526
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,559
have the answer here answer is the level

527
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:20,799
your answer equals zero

528
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,799
uh let's put the minus one so we we can

529
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,559
increment it immediately so they'll

530
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,080
become a zero

531
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,080
okay

532
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,960
so now we can do this we can do the move

533
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,760
yeah

534
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,600
four uh we can do the current current is

535
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:36,159
rc equals

536
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:38,799
q dot pop left right

537
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:41,840
we take it take one uh

538
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:43,280
actually we want to take n element out

539
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,640
of q because

540
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:49,280
there's number n equals length q less

541
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:51,760
as i said we are taking everything in

542
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:54,320
the queue dq we are taking everything in

543
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,080
the queue we popping out right

544
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,080
and then we need to do this for

545
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,760
underscore in

546
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,159
range

547
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,360
and we're taking everything out r c

548
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,080
equals

549
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,760
q dot problem right we're taking

550
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,799
these out

551
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,400
right

552
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:15,120
okay so now look we we take this rc out

553
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,880
then we need to check if it's then

554
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,559
if it's the destination and we can

555
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,760
return answer right

556
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:23,520
so if bought

557
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,919
rc

558
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:28,000
equal equal one we are starting on kings

559
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,799
king so where are we going to

560
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,039
end terminate

561
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:35,200
all right we are starting on king so if

562
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,640
the ball is what

563
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,799
if

564
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,280
the ball is what we starting from king

565
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:44,960
and then if we visited

566
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:47,200
if we visited what

567
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,520
night or horse yeah the night

568
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,919
let's let's do a horse okay if we if we

569
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,840
ended the horse then we can just return

570
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,240
answer yeah

571
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:59,120
all right okay now i i want to visit

572
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:01,600
look i'm an rc i'm at this position as

573
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,600
as you know yeah as we know there are a

574
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:07,520
position yeah we know how to visit all a

575
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,520
position right yeah

576
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:14,559
from here we know possibly the maximum a

577
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:17,440
children right we want to push

578
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,960
okay i'm going to push these eight kids

579
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,720
if they are

580
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,799
if it's still

581
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:26,000
inside this ball yeah if it's not

582
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:27,280
outside and if it's empty right because

583
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,280
it's not empty

584
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,679
then we don't need right

585
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,559
i'm right make sense

586
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,360
so

587
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:37,360
for

588
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:39,760
let's say dr dc this is data in a

589
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:42,640
position we can use the list of the

590
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:45,520
coordinates yeah or we can use the array

591
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:48,640
of continuous use of two parts

592
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:50,559
okay one two yeah this is offset yeah

593
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,799
one two

594
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:55,120
one minus two

595
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:56,480
minus one two okay you can think about

596
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,919
it there there are eight of them okay

597
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,440
i'm not going to write over there you

598
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,320
know the a position this is the

599
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,360
continuing and then i need to say n r

600
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,720
and c

601
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,080
equals

602
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,280
r plus

603
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,760
d r

604
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:11,840
c plus dc this is the

605
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:14,799
next this is the position of the next

606
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,480
node right and then look if this knows n

607
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,600
r and c are in the range okay in the

608
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,280
range

609
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,320
how do you say in the range i'm running

610
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:23,280
up space

611
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:25,120
so look you can say zero smaller than nr

612
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:28,640
smaller than rows

613
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:31,280
yeah zero smaller than nc smaller than

614
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,480
columns if we're in a range

615
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,880
also

616
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,880
the bot and r and c needs to be what

617
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:41,440
come on you can answer this

618
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,440
and i and c needs to be what i said

619
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:44,640
look

620
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,120
if i i'm here i want to jump to the next

621
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:51,240
position if only if what

622
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:51,240
not to condition eva

623
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:59,440
i want to jump into the next position

624
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,440
yeah yeah

625
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:05,520
so obviously we need to find out if the

626
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:06,880
e this n r and c is not in a yeah it's

627
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,440
not in uh

628
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:12,320
sin yeah obviously we can say

629
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,720
n r and c

630
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,799
not in c yeah not in c if we're not in

631
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,200
scene i know we need to add it somewhere

632
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:21,840
i've seen.add

633
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,200
an rnc

634
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,279
okay

635
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,640
so do we need to check if the board is

636
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:28,559
empty or not

637
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:32,400
do we need to check

638
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:34,159
if we don't check uh

639
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,000
no we don't need to check why is that

640
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,000
because if we check is empty then you

641
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,720
will never find uh

642
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,120
yeah look you will never find the horse

643
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,520
yeah because yeah do you get it if we

644
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:48,720
check is empty and then this if it's

645
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:50,159
empty we append it right we append it

646
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,000
and then you'll never find the heart

647
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:55,039
right because that

648
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,200
we need to append its kit only if it's

649
00:24:55,039 --> 00:25:00,799
inside the box if it's the next booth is

650
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:02,799
an airport and if it's not visited right

651
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:05,120
if it's not visited

652
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:08,559
make sense and then return if we can

653
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:09,919
find it we determine minus one right

654
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:12,799
okay

655
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:14,559
this is called marty sauce mutty sauce

656
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:16,880
if we're starting for the horse then

657
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:18,640
that's monty so if we start a king start

658
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,159
from the king that's only let's see a

659
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,480
single source okay

660
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:24,640
let's stay a single source

661
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:28,799
sin dot n r and c and then q need to

662
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,799
append and i is here q little

663
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,760
next move okay

664
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:42,320
okay so

665
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,200
one question for you eric can i exchange

666
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,240
these

667
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,240
can i swap these two

668
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,080
this is the king this is the horse can i

669
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,720
swap these two

670
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,159
and if yes

671
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,400
why

672
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:58,240
this is the

673
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,159
this is the what we are talking about in

674
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,919
this lesson

675
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:05,600
we start from king

676
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:07,039
yeah oh we can start from horse can we

677
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,400
yeah

678
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:10,480
come on say it loud

679
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,400
yeah yeah we can obviously we start

680
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,320
because we know it's only one king so we

681
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,559
start from king it's better

682
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,640
right the term times x t will be o n

683
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,799
square because they are if they are n

684
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,919
cells then they are n square

685
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:26,320
edges and we visiting each vertex

686
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:27,200
exactly once we're using the hash

687
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,760
scene

688
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,840
right but if we start from horse i know

689
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:34,720
we need to find a king

690
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,440
so let's marty sauce right hey listen to

691
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,039
me

692
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,440
we start from the horse because there

693
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:41,520
will be many many horses so at the

694
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:44,400
beginning and here if we start from a

695
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:46,799
horse then these will be executed

696
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:49,360
there could be multiple horses put

697
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:51,679
appendix in a cure right and when we

698
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,360
start at the beginning it's instead of

699
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:56,320
continuing the single king we will have

700
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:58,080
many many horses here many many horses

701
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,080
at the beginning right

702
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:03,039
these could be many many horses right

703
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,039
many many horses

704
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,559
and then we can each for each one we can

705
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,799
expand uh it's eight kids yeah possibly

706
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:13,760
eight kids right and we find a king

707
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:17,120
right so look there could be n

708
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,919
forces so the time complexity will be

709
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,840
o

710
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:22,399
n times

711
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:24,880
squared right but this m

712
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:25,840
could be in the order of n right because

713
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,520
look

714
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:30,399
they are n position on the board and

715
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,760
then could be m m is smaller or equal

716
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:33,600
than n right

717
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,120
yeah okay

718
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,200
so this time complexity which one is

719
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,279
better o n times n square or over n

720
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,880
squared which is better

721
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:43,679
yeah obviously because it's great okay

722
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,520
and you you reverse it yeah you reverse

723
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,919
it m you pick one right because we start

724
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,600
from the single key the time the space

725
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:52,720
compacts the water spectrum basically

726
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,720
are we using any space here

727
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,880
c

728
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,919
and k cube so what's the space for my

729
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,320
city

730
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:02,480
oh and because look yes there are n

731
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,840
vertices yeah and vertices

732
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,120
and vertices

733
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,679
so

734
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:10,240
because we have only we're using the

735
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:12,640
c set to visit to store the number of

736
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:15,279
vertex we have we i have seen so that

737
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,600
almost the time complexity is

738
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:19,760
there there could be n vertex in the

739
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,080
scene in the hashtag okay and the cube

740
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,080
as well

741
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,559
uh

742
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:30,159
any questions over

743
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:31,760
what's the subject we talked about today

744
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:35,120
sorry yes

745
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:37,440
and what's the agreement we're using

746
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:40,000
and we also talked about what what kind

747
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,000
of breakfast

748
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,200
martis machi sauce multi stocks

749
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,360
multi-source preference search

750
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,919
previously we have focused on the single

751
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:52,000
source purposes right look at the final

752
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:53,279
research we push the loop there's only

753
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,240
one load

754
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:56,480
yeah

755
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,960
level by level yeah what's a perfect

756
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,799
search of this order

757
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,760
this travels

758
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:05,039
yeah that's it and if now we basically

759
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,120
today

760
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:09,120
no difference it's just actual one we

761
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:12,240
have another five here

762
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:14,720
and what's the preference of this one

763
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,120
five two three four six well done that's

764
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,039
it that's the takeaway today okay and

765
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:21,200
instead of doing that we just push

766
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:22,080
instead of pushing one note here we just

767
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,880
push

768
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:27,120
the multiple notes in the queue right we

769
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:30,080
push the one five and the q

770
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:33,120
yeah look we push one five in the kill

771
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:35,279
right and then we take one out

772
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,200
push all its kids two three five four

773
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:40,640
here and we take the fire out we push

774
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,679
the kid six here you see it's the same

775
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,600
yeah

776
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,679
it's the same yeah

777
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:48,159
okay that's it for today bye bye

778
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,159
goodbye

779
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,480
can you say bye bye again

780
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,480
bye-bye
