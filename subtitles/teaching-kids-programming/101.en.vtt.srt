okay so remember yesterday we talked
 

9
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,030
okay so remember yesterday we talked
about dynamic programming yeah we have

10
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:11,040
about dynamic programming yeah we have
 

11
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,709
about dynamic programming yeah we have
been talking about dynamic programming

12
00:00:12,709 --> 00:00:12,719
been talking about dynamic programming
 

13
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,310
been talking about dynamic programming
for a few days

14
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:14,320
for a few days
 

15
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,990
for a few days
and yesterday we talked about using

16
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:16,000
and yesterday we talked about using
 

17
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,990
and yesterday we talked about using
dynamic programming to climb the stairs

18
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:18,000
dynamic programming to climb the stairs
 

19
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,109
dynamic programming to climb the stairs
all right okay so now today another

20
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:21,119
all right okay so now today another
 

21
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,470
all right okay so now today another
interesting problem

22
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:22,480
interesting problem
 

23
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,790
interesting problem
okay so suppose there's a street yeah a

24
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:24,800
okay so suppose there's a street yeah a
 

25
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,670
okay so suppose there's a street yeah a
street

26
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:25,680
street
 

27
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,830
street
a street i'm in a car no and there's a

28
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:28,840
a street i'm in a car no and there's a
 

29
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,150
a street i'm in a car no and there's a
house

30
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:30,160
house
 

31
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,910
house
one house two hours smooth

32
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:33,920
one house two hours smooth
 

33
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,750
one house two hours smooth
how house it could be on the street the

34
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:35,760
how house it could be on the street the
 

35
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:43,110
how house it could be on the street the
cars would just smash into it

36
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:43,120

 

37
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,590

they have to have yeah okay that's

38
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:45,600
they have to have yeah okay that's
 

39
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,270
they have to have yeah okay that's
that's fine that's fine

okay you know some goods yeah and we use
 

51
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,069
okay you know some goods yeah and we use
the number integer

52
00:01:02,069 --> 00:01:02,079
the number integer
 

53
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,109
the number integer
for example to to represent how

54
00:01:05,109 --> 00:01:05,119
for example to to represent how
 

55
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,070
for example to to represent how
uh how much money he has yeah for

56
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:08,080
uh how much money he has yeah for
 

57
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:08,469
uh how much money he has yeah for
example

58
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:08,479
example
 

59
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:13,830

those values the goods in this street
in the house on this street yeah but the

82
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:42,960
in the house on this street yeah but the
 

83
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,230
in the house on this street yeah but the
thing is that if

84
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:44,240
thing is that if

to neighbor neighboring house yeah
if you took the if you if you take the

96
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:01,119
if you took the if you if you take the
 

97
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,350
if you took the if you if you take the
goods from two neighboring house

98
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:03,360
goods from two neighboring house
 

99
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,789
goods from two neighboring house
the alarm will be will fire off yeah

100
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:06,799
the alarm will be will fire off yeah
 

101
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:07,510
the alarm will be will fire off yeah
we'll be off

102
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:07,520
we'll be off
 

103
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,190
we'll be off
yeah yeah and then a police will come so

104
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:11,200
yeah yeah and then a police will come so
 

105
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,910
yeah yeah and then a police will come so
so you shouldn't take the goods from the

106
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:13,920
so you shouldn't take the goods from the
 

107
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,670
so you shouldn't take the goods from the
into neighborings

108
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:15,680
into neighborings
 

109
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,190
into neighborings
okay but you can't i could have done

110
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:17,200
okay but you can't i could have done
 

111
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,030
okay but you can't i could have done
that because i didn't have the key

112
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:19,040
that because i didn't have the key
 

113
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,350
that because i didn't have the key
yeah that's okay that's why the robot

114
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:21,360
yeah that's okay that's why the robot
 

115
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,630
yeah that's okay that's why the robot
broke into the houses

116
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:22,640
broke into the houses
 

117
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,510
broke into the houses
okay so the thing is that the robot

118
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:25,520
okay so the thing is that the robot
 

119
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,030
okay so the thing is that the robot
could to take at least five

120
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:27,040
could to take at least five
 

121
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,470
could to take at least five
but look you could take five yeah

122
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:30,480
but look you could take five yeah
 

123
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,350
but look you could take five yeah
and then two yeah and then ten so hold

124
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:33,360
and then two yeah and then ten so hold
 

125
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,150
and then two yeah and then ten so hold
together how much to get

126
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:36,160
together how much to get
 

127
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,030
together how much to get
so let's so basically you are you want

128
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,040
so let's so basically you are you want
 

129
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,750
so let's so basically you are you want
to pick

130
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:39,760
to pick
 

131
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,190
to pick
the the values the numbers yeah

132
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:43,200
the the values the numbers yeah
 

133
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,790
the the values the numbers yeah
the numbers but not picking the

134
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:46,800
the numbers but not picking the
 

135
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,390
the numbers but not picking the
neighboring so if you pick five you

136
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:48,400
neighboring so if you pick five you
 

137
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,070
neighboring so if you pick five you
shouldn't pick seven but if you pick

138
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:50,080
shouldn't pick seven but if you pick
 

139
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,589
shouldn't pick seven but if you pick
five you can pick

140
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:51,599
five you can pick
 

141
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,470
five you can pick
two or not pick two pick one yeah so

142
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:54,480
two or not pick two pick one yeah so
 

143
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,750
two or not pick two pick one yeah so
this is

144
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:55,760
this is

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,350

are there any better ones

170
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:39,360

 

171
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,390

wait no i think this is the

172
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:42,400
wait no i think this is the
 

173
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,990
wait no i think this is the
optimal one this is the optima yeah

174
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,000
optimal one this is the optima yeah
 

175
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,789
optimal one this is the optima yeah
okay how about seven and ten

176
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:50,799
okay how about seven and ten
 

177
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,670
okay how about seven and ten
seven and ten but again the another

178
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:53,680
seven and ten but again the another
 

179
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,750
seven and ten but again the another
solution will be seven and ten

180
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:55,760
solution will be seven and ten
 

181
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,550
solution will be seven and ten
which is seven but that's okay you can

182
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:58,560
which is seven but that's okay you can
 

183
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,550
which is seven but that's okay you can
skip two

184
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:00,560
skip two
 

185
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,990
skip two
okay so any ideas how are we doing this

186
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:06,000
okay so any ideas how are we doing this
 

187
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,990
okay so any ideas how are we doing this
any ideas any thoughts

188
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:10,000
any ideas any thoughts
 

189
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,750
any ideas any thoughts
using the dynamic programming since we

190
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:11,760
using the dynamic programming since we
 

191
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,710
using the dynamic programming since we
are on this subject use the biggest one

192
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:14,720
are on this subject use the biggest one
 

193
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,990
are on this subject use the biggest one
biggest one the biggest one

194
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:18,000
biggest one the biggest one
 

195
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,310
biggest one the biggest one
or the biggest one ten you pick you'll

196
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:20,320
or the biggest one ten you pick you'll
 

197
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,230
or the biggest one ten you pick you'll
pick the biggest one and then

198
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:22,240
pick the biggest one and then
 

199
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,990
pick the biggest one and then
uh the second biggest if it's

200
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,000
uh the second biggest if it's
 

201
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,790
uh the second biggest if it's
the biggest neighbor yeah then you do

202
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:28,800
the biggest neighbor yeah then you do
 

203
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,310
the biggest neighbor yeah then you do
this

204
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:30,320
this
 

205
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,670
this
so first third biggest third biggest

206
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:33,680
so first third biggest third biggest
 

207
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,270
so first third biggest third biggest
and then so your strategy is

208
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:37,280
and then so your strategy is
 

209
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:44,870
and then so your strategy is
how do you pick them so for this one

210
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:44,880

 

211
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,830

yeah how do you pick it up yeah

212
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:49,840
yeah how do you pick it up yeah
 

213
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,990
yeah how do you pick it up yeah
what's your strategy what's your status

214
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,000
what's your strategy what's your status
 

215
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,189
what's your strategy what's your status
is to kick it

216
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:53,199
is to kick it
 

217
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,749
is to kick it
you pick the largest one yeah and then

218
00:04:55,749 --> 00:04:55,759
you pick the largest one yeah and then
 

219
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,629
you pick the largest one yeah and then
you start from the largest one and then

220
00:04:58,629 --> 00:04:58,639
you start from the largest one and then
 

221
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,629
you start from the largest one and then
to pick to jump at

222
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:02,639
to pick to jump at
 

223
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,749
to pick to jump at
you you only pick these two or not

224
00:05:05,749 --> 00:05:05,759
you you only pick these two or not
 

225
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,909
you you only pick these two or not
or you're gonna pick five yeah what are

226
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:07,919
or you're gonna pick five yeah what are
 

227
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,990
or you're gonna pick five yeah what are
you gonna pick

228
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:10,000
you gonna pick
 

229
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,230
you gonna pick
suppose look if if

230
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:14,240
suppose look if if
 

231
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,830
suppose look if if
if this is a all right leave it this is

232
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:17,840
if this is a all right leave it this is
 

233
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,350
if this is a all right leave it this is
right so you turn

234
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:19,360
right so you turn
 

235
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,909
right so you turn
and then put the second lattice which is

236
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:21,919
and then put the second lattice which is
 

237
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:22,950
and then put the second lattice which is
18 yeah

238
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:22,960
18 yeah
 

239
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,909
18 yeah
yeah and how about if i have at least

240
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:25,919
yeah and how about if i have at least
 

241
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:31,510
yeah and how about if i have at least
another 10 here

242
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:31,520

 

243
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,189

maybe no maybe i put this 15 here

244
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:35,199
maybe no maybe i put this 15 here
 

245
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,510
maybe no maybe i put this 15 here
then 15. 10

246
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:39,520
then 15. 10
 

247
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,590
then 15. 10
so you always pick the second second

248
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:41,600
so you always pick the second second
 

249
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,870
so you always pick the second second
largest i know if this is 19 here

250
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:44,880
largest i know if this is 19 here
 

251
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,629
largest i know if this is 19 here
i'll pick 19 15 then i'll pick

252
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:48,639
i'll pick 19 15 then i'll pick
 

253
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,590
i'll pick 19 15 then i'll pick
six 1956

254
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:53,600
six 1956
 

255
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,390
six 1956
okay so your strategy might work but

256
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:56,400
okay so your strategy might work but
 

257
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,150
okay so your strategy might work but
there are some cases it might not work

258
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:58,160
there are some cases it might not work
 

259
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,990
there are some cases it might not work
okay and i need to come up with some

260
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,000
okay and i need to come up with some
 

261
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,390
okay and i need to come up with some
some uh so you pick always pick the

262
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:02,400
some uh so you pick always pick the
 

263
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,150
some uh so you pick always pick the
largest one yeah

264
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:04,160
largest one yeah
 

265
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,710
largest one yeah
you always pick the largest one so let's

266
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:06,720
you always pick the largest one so let's
 

267
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,909
you always pick the largest one so let's
say 18 here

268
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:07,919
say 18 here
 

269
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,029
say 18 here
glasses one and then you pick uh

270
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:11,039
glasses one and then you pick uh
 

271
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,110
glasses one and then you pick uh
uh and then i put uh

272
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:15,120

 

273
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,390

what you get

274
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:18,400

 

275
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,070

you pick you'll pick at 19 yeah yeah

276
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:22,080
you pick you'll pick at 19 yeah yeah
 

277
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,590
you pick you'll pick at 19 yeah yeah
and then 19. what what's that

278
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:25,600
and then 19. what what's that
 

279
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,749
and then 19. what what's that
sorry no i'm i'm thinking of yeah i'm 20

280
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:29,759
sorry no i'm i'm thinking of yeah i'm 20
 

281
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,110
sorry no i'm i'm thinking of yeah i'm 20
okay maybe 20 here so you pick 20

282
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:33,120
okay maybe 20 here so you pick 20
 

283
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,469
okay maybe 20 here so you pick 20
and 19 yes then six

284
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:36,479
and 19 yes then six
 

285
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,830
and 19 yes then six
and six it might work yeah

286
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:39,840
and six it might work yeah
 

287
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,430
and six it might work yeah
it might work 20

288
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:43,440
it might work 20
 

289
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,510
it might work 20
you pick 20

290
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:47,520

 

291
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,830

oh well it's 19 years well

292
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:51,840

 

293
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,110

okay and then you pick 19.

294
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,120
okay and then you pick 19.
 

295
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,469
okay and then you pick 19.
you pick 18 as well no you if once you

296
00:06:58,469 --> 00:06:58,479
you pick 18 as well no you if once you
 

297
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,830
you pick 18 as well no you if once you
pick 19 you complete 18 because they are

298
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:00,840
pick 19 you complete 18 because they are
 

299
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,270
pick 19 you complete 18 because they are
neighbors well how about if you pick

300
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:03,280
neighbors well how about if you pick
 

301
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,029
neighbors well how about if you pick
uh oh yeah no yeah yeah

302
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:07,039
uh oh yeah no yeah yeah
 

303
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,629
uh oh yeah no yeah yeah
so it doesn't mean that you could pick

304
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:08,639
so it doesn't mean that you could pick
 

305
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,710
so it doesn't mean that you could pick
19 and six

306
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:10,720
19 and six
 

307
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,909
19 and six
you can pick 19 and six yeah

308
00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:13,919
you can pick 19 and six yeah
 

309
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,990
you can pick 19 and six yeah
okay so i'm trying to think about the

310
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:16,000
okay so i'm trying to think about the
 

311
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,870
okay so i'm trying to think about the
negative examples

312
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:18,880
negative examples
 

313
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,990
negative examples
yes what's negative i mean the one that

314
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:22,000
yes what's negative i mean the one that
 

315
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,790
yes what's negative i mean the one that
your strategy

316
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:22,800
your strategy
 

317
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,150
your strategy
doesn't work so look

318
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:26,160
doesn't work so look
 

319
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,990
doesn't work so look
so i'm thinking of you always pick a

320
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:28,000
so i'm thinking of you always pick a
 

321
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,469
so i'm thinking of you always pick a
knight the biggest one

322
00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:30,479
knight the biggest one
 

323
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,510
knight the biggest one
yeah a biggest one and how about if they

324
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:33,520
yeah a biggest one and how about if they
 

325
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,110
yeah a biggest one and how about if they
have duplicate numbers

326
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:35,120
have duplicate numbers
 

327
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,589
have duplicate numbers
so which one you pick yeah

328
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:39,599
so which one you pick yeah
 

329
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,230
so which one you pick yeah
so you need three of them yeah i know so

330
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:42,240
so you need three of them yeah i know so
 

331
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,189
so you need three of them yeah i know so
which which one

332
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:43,199
which which one
 

333
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:48,070
which which one
are the largest there's no largest wall

334
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:48,080
are the largest there's no largest wall
 

335
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,270
are the largest there's no largest wall
there's 20 okay maybe that looks

336
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:51,280
there's 20 okay maybe that looks
 

337
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,150
there's 20 okay maybe that looks
19 here so what what do you pick

338
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:56,160
19 here so what what do you pick
 

339
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,510
19 here so what what do you pick
i'll pick definitely one of the nine

340
00:07:59,510 --> 00:07:59,520
i'll pick definitely one of the nine
 

341
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,390
i'll pick definitely one of the nine
teams

342
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:00,400
teams
 

343
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,550
teams
yeah but now you might need to pull the

344
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:02,560
yeah but now you might need to pull the
 

345
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,430
yeah but now you might need to pull the
proof of search right

346
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:07,440

 

347
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:17,350

for example or 19 so what happened

348
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:17,360

 

349
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,070

can you pick four yeah you can only pick

350
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,080
can you pick four yeah you can only pick
 

351
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,629
can you pick four yeah you can only pick
three

352
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:20,639
three
 

353
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,670
three
so that's how many number two three yeah

354
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:23,680
so that's how many number two three yeah
 

355
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,270
so that's how many number two three yeah
because every other one yeah

356
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:25,280
because every other one yeah
 

357
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,469
because every other one yeah
yeah so every other one

358
00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:28,479
yeah so every other one
 

359
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,830
yeah so every other one
okay so so it seems that

360
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:31,840
okay so so it seems that
 

361
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,949
okay so so it seems that
if it in this case you you just pick

362
00:08:34,949 --> 00:08:34,959
if it in this case you you just pick
 

363
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:36,709
if it in this case you you just pick
every other one so do you have a do you

364
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:36,719
every other one so do you have a do you
 

365
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,310
every other one so do you have a do you
come up with some

366
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:38,320
come up with some
 

367
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,589
come up with some
genetic uh i mean general approach to

368
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:41,599
genetic uh i mean general approach to
 

369
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,790
genetic uh i mean general approach to
approach that

370
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:44,800

 

371
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,990

uh yeah you can

372
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:48,000
uh yeah you can
 

373
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,310
uh yeah you can
also search from here you can search

374
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:50,320
also search from here you can search
 

375
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,990
also search from here you can search
from this side you pick this one or not

376
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:52,000
from this side you pick this one or not
 

377
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,310
from this side you pick this one or not
pick

378
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:52,320
pick
 

379
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,550
pick
this one yeah once you pick this one

380
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:54,560
this one yeah once you pick this one
 

381
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,150
this one yeah once you pick this one
you're not picking this one and you go

382
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:56,160
you're not picking this one and you go
 

383
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,790
you're not picking this one and you go
to the next

384
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:56,800
to the next
 

385
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,829
to the next
yeah yeah so you you

386
00:08:59,829 --> 00:08:59,839
yeah yeah so you you
 

387
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,990
yeah yeah so you you
start from the search definite search we

388
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:02,000
start from the search definite search we
 

389
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,389
start from the search definite search we
can do a deathless search right

390
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:04,399
can do a deathless search right
 

391
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,829
can do a deathless search right
yeah all right do you remember that

392
00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:07,839
yeah all right do you remember that
 

393
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,190
yeah all right do you remember that
bfs or bfs also work as well so

394
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:11,200
bfs or bfs also work as well so
 

395
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,949
bfs or bfs also work as well so
basically the tree i start from the

396
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:12,959
basically the tree i start from the
 

397
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,230
basically the tree i start from the
first house

398
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:14,240
first house
 

399
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,150
first house
first half right i pick

400
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:18,160
first half right i pick
 

401
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,070
first half right i pick
this one is pick yeah and the next one

402
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:22,080
this one is pick yeah and the next one
 

403
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,110
this one is pick yeah and the next one
is not pink

404
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:25,120

 

405
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,310

i i'm constructing a tree so but you can

406
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:28,320
i i'm constructing a tree so but you can
 

407
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,070
i i'm constructing a tree so but you can
search it with different search or

408
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:30,080
search it with different search or
 

409
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,350
search it with different search or
preferences right

410
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:31,360
preferences right
 

411
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,389
preferences right

433
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,630

yes but so maybe we can refine this tree

434
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:10,640
yes but so maybe we can refine this tree
 

435
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,590
yes but so maybe we can refine this tree
to to not to just like if i only have

436
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:13,600
to to not to just like if i only have
 

437
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,069
to to not to just like if i only have
one and

438

00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:18,079
will be three yeah yeah
 

443
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,750
will be three yeah yeah
oh oh

444
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:21,760
oh oh
 

445
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:27,430
oh oh
you can do five oh

446
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:27,440

 

447
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,430

yeah yeah as long as it so so as you can

yeah yeah as long as it so so as you can
 

449
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,430
yeah yeah as long as it so so as you can
see when i pick one

450
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:31,440
see when i pick one
 

451
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,030
see when i pick one
when i pick one i can travel

452
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:35,040
when i pick one i can travel
 

453
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,269
when i pick one i can travel
to when i pick one i can travel to

454
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:39,279
to when i pick one i can travel to
 

455
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,230
to when i pick one i can travel to
three yeah pick one to three and when i

456
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:42,240
three yeah pick one to three and when i
 

457
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,590
three yeah pick one to three and when i
start from three

458
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:43,600
start from three
 

459
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,870
start from three
i can start from five okay all right

460
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:46,880
i can start from five okay all right
 

461
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,269
i can start from five okay all right
so but for this one so look because it

462
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:49,279
so but for this one so look because it
 

463
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,310
so but for this one so look because it
has a lot of

464
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:50,320
has a lot of
 

465
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,670
has a lot of
possibilities pick one and then i can

466
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:53,680
possibilities pick one and then i can
 

467
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,509
possibilities pick one and then i can
pick three i can also pick four here

468
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:55,519
pick three i can also pick four here
 

469
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:56,230
pick three i can also pick four here
right

470
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:56,240
right
 

471
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,430
right
yeah yeah and i also can pick five pick

472
00:10:59,430 --> 00:10:59,440
yeah yeah and i also can pick five pick
 

473
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,710
yeah yeah and i also can pick five pick
six p you see this is very complex

474
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:02,720
six p you see this is very complex
 

475
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,670
six p you see this is very complex
all right there's no seven i know i know

476
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:05,680
all right there's no seven i know i know
 

477
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,670
all right there's no seven i know i know
i'm just giving an example so do you get

478
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:07,680
i'm just giving an example so do you get
 

479
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,630
i'm just giving an example so do you get
it

480
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:08,640
it
 

481
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,190
it
so look this is very time consuming

482
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:11,200
so look this is very time consuming
 

483
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,069
so look this is very time consuming
because for each node

484
00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:14,079
because for each node
 

485
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,110
because for each node
you could you could the next note you

486
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:17,120
you could you could the next note you
 

487
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,670
you could you could the next note you
could be

488
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:17,680
could be
 

489
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,430
could be
any from uh if you pick the no i

490
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:21,440
any from uh if you pick the no i
 

491
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,550
any from uh if you pick the no i
so the next note when you are i know

492
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:24,560
so the next note when you are i know
 

493
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,670
so the next note when you are i know
yeah so that next note could be from i

494
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:27,680
yeah so that next note could be from i
 

495
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,829
yeah so that next note could be from i
plus 2

496
00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:29,839
plus 2
 

497
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,990
plus 2
to n right yeah all right

498
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:34,000
to n right yeah all right
 

499
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,670
to n right yeah all right
so what's the complexity of this one

500
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:36,680
so what's the complexity of this one
 

501
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,790
so what's the complexity of this one
[Music]

502
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:40,800
[Music]
 

503
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,430
[Music]
so there are duplication here oh it's

504
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:43,440
so there are duplication here oh it's
 

505
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,150
so there are duplication here oh it's
it's very

506
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:44,160
it's very
 

507
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,269
it's very
exponential you know it's exponential a

508
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:47,279
exponential you know it's exponential a
 

509
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,750
exponential you know it's exponential a
and something

510
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:51,760
and something
 

511
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,310
and something
how many nodes are there the n and and

512
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:54,320
how many nodes are there the n and and
 

513
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,470
how many nodes are there the n and and
unknowns yeah normally

514
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:56,480
unknowns yeah normally
 

515
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,750
unknowns yeah normally
into that to the power of n yeah

516
00:11:59,750 --> 00:11:59,760
into that to the power of n yeah
 

517
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,030
into that to the power of n yeah
yeah so look actually this is a bit

518
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:03,040
yeah so look actually this is a bit
 

519
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,590
yeah so look actually this is a bit
complex

520
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:03,600
complex
 

521
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,350
complex
look if you pick this yeah you can pick

522
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:07,360
look if you pick this yeah you can pick
 

523
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,829
look if you pick this yeah you can pick
this

524
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:08,839
this
 

525
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,430
this
yeah i'll pick this yeah

526
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:11,440
yeah i'll pick this yeah
 

527
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,629
yeah i'll pick this yeah
if you pick this look if i pick one pick

528
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:14,639
if you pick this look if i pick one pick
 

529
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,910
if you pick this look if i pick one pick
this one and pick this one only

530
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:17,920
this one and pick this one only
 

531
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,949
this one and pick this one only
this is not optimum yeah because i can

532
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:20,959
this is not optimum yeah because i can
 

533
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,269
this is not optimum yeah because i can
i can also pick this one why not pick it

534
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:23,279
i can also pick this one why not pick it
 

535
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,310
i can also pick this one why not pick it
all right yeah

536
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:24,320
all right yeah
 

537
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,949
all right yeah
so look at the tree has duplication so

538
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:26,959
so look at the tree has duplication so
 

539
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,550
so look at the tree has duplication so
somehow

540
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:28,560
somehow
 

541
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,710
somehow
we are searching some branch which is

542
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:30,720
we are searching some branch which is
 

543
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,790
we are searching some branch which is
not optimal we know

544
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:32,800
not optimal we know
 

545
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,069
not optimal we know
right because look if i pick this one

546
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:36,079
right because look if i pick this one
 

547
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,069
right because look if i pick this one
and the next one i skip three and i pick

548
00:12:38,069 --> 00:12:38,079
and the next one i skip three and i pick
 

549
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,150
and the next one i skip three and i pick
this one this is not optimum because i

550
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:40,160
this one this is not optimum because i
 

551
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,069
this one this is not optimum because i
can i know i can always pick

552
00:12:42,069 --> 00:12:42,079
can i know i can always pick
 

553
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,509
can i know i can always pick
this middle one which is more value

554
00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:45,519
this middle one which is more value
 

555
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,430
this middle one which is more value
am right if these values are all

556
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:47,440
am right if these values are all
 

557
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,590
am right if these values are all
positive do you get it

558
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:49,600
positive do you get it
 

559
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,790
positive do you get it
okay so this is not optimum so the

560
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:52,800
okay so this is not optimum so the
 

561
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,750
okay so this is not optimum so the
tfs or bfs may work if they are the

562
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:55,760
tfs or bfs may work if they are the
 

563
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,710
tfs or bfs may work if they are the
number of the

564
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:56,720
number of the
 

565
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,190
number of the
houses are small maybe like five five

566
00:12:59,190 --> 00:12:59,200
houses are small maybe like five five
 

567
00:12:59,200 --> 00:12:59,990
houses are small maybe like five five
houses

568
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:00,000
houses
 

569
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,870
houses
ten houses the computer is fast yeah if

570
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:02,880
ten houses the computer is fast yeah if
 

571
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,110
ten houses the computer is fast yeah if
five houses five to the power five

572
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:05,120
five houses five to the power five
 

573
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,509
five houses five to the power five
it's very small number yeah look but if

574
00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:07,519
it's very small number yeah look but if
 

575
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,910
it's very small number yeah look but if
it's 100 to the power of 100

576
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:09,920
it's 100 to the power of 100
 

577
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,030
it's 100 to the power of 100
this is a huge number yeah yeah i'm

578
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:13,040
this is a huge number yeah yeah i'm
 

579
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,949
this is a huge number yeah yeah i'm
right a hundred that would be a hundred

580
00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:14,959
right a hundred that would be a hundred
 

581
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,150
right a hundred that would be a hundred
zero after after a hundred yeah maybe

582
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:18,160
zero after after a hundred yeah maybe
 

583
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,430
zero after after a hundred yeah maybe
maybe how many zeros i don't know

584
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:21,440
maybe how many zeros i don't know
 

585
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,550
maybe how many zeros i don't know
twenty four hundred zeros yeah yeah okay

586
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:24,560
twenty four hundred zeros yeah yeah okay
 

587
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,949
twenty four hundred zeros yeah yeah okay
so that's all that's a huge number the

588
00:13:26,949 --> 00:13:26,959
so that's all that's a huge number the
 

589
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,790
so that's all that's a huge number the
computer wouldn't

590
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:28,800
computer wouldn't
 

591
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,990
computer wouldn't
be able to compute it you know

592
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:32,000
be able to compute it you know
 

593
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,590
be able to compute it you know
for for in the short time amount of time

594
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:35,600
for for in the short time amount of time
 

595
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,710
for for in the short time amount of time
okay so this search blue for search

596
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:38,720
okay so this search blue for search
 

597
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,110
okay so this search blue for search
we call it brief research does not is no

598
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:41,120
we call it brief research does not is no
 

599
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,990
we call it brief research does not is no
idea

600
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:42,000
idea
 

601
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,670
idea
so i give you a hint that dynamic

602
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:43,680
so i give you a hint that dynamic
 

603
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,269
so i give you a hint that dynamic
programming so

604
00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:45,279
programming so
 

605
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,550
programming so
suppose i'm here at the last house

606
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:48,560
suppose i'm here at the last house
 

607
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:53,030
suppose i'm here at the last house
yeah yeah so

608
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:53,040

 

609
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,230

so does it uh

610
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:56,240
so does it uh
 

611
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,110
so does it uh
if i'm at this last house and then i can

612
00:13:59,110 --> 00:13:59,120
if i'm at this last house and then i can
 

613
00:13:59,120 --> 00:13:59,910
if i'm at this last house and then i can
collect it

614
00:13:59,910 --> 00:13:59,920
collect it
 

615
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,829
collect it
yeah if i collect it

616
00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:03,839
yeah if i collect it
 

617
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,910
yeah if i collect it
i can't collect this one yeah i can pick

618
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:05,920
i can't collect this one yeah i can pick
 

619
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,269
i can't collect this one yeah i can pick
this one

620
00:14:07,269 --> 00:14:07,279
this one
 

621
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,310
this one
so so i i will compare to

622
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:10,320
so so i i will compare to
 

623
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,710
so so i i will compare to
if i pick this one if i pick this house

624
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:12,720
if i pick this one if i pick this house
 

625
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,590
if i pick this one if i pick this house
i will pick

626
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:13,600
i will pick
 

627
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,629
i will pick
pick i will pick

628
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:16,639
pick i will pick
 

629
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,949
pick i will pick
the previous location would be this one

630
00:14:18,949 --> 00:14:18,959
the previous location would be this one
 

631
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:19,910
the previous location would be this one
right

632
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:19,920
right
 

633
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,829
right
yeah or i don't pick this one

634
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:23,839
yeah or i don't pick this one
 

635
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,509
yeah or i don't pick this one
i don't pick this one and the previous

636
00:14:25,509 --> 00:14:25,519
i don't pick this one and the previous
 

637
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,030
i don't pick this one and the previous
location could be this one

638
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:27,040
location could be this one
 

639
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,230
location could be this one
do you see it yes

640
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:30,240
do you see it yes
 

641
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,509
do you see it yes
so look if i use fn to

642
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:33,519
so look if i use fn to
 

643
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,550
so look if i use fn to
to represent the number of the number of

644
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:36,560
to represent the number of the number of
 

645
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,310
to represent the number of the number of
values i can collect

646
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:38,320
values i can collect
 

647
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,509
values i can collect
the numbers i can collect at house n

648
00:14:41,509 --> 00:14:41,519
the numbers i can collect at house n
 

649
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,550
the numbers i can collect at house n
yeah am i mm-hmm

650
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:44,560
yeah am i mm-hmm
 

651
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,550
yeah am i mm-hmm
so let's see f1 equals one

652
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:48,560

 

653
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,590

if i'm at if i i walk from the left to

654
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:51,600
if i'm at if i i walk from the left to
 

655
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,310
if i'm at if i i walk from the left to
the right

656
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:52,320
the right
 

657
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,629
the right
okay so f1 is representing the number of

658
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:56,639
okay so f1 is representing the number of
 

659
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,269
okay so f1 is representing the number of
values that i can collect from house one

660
00:14:59,269 --> 00:14:59,279
values that i can collect from house one
 

661
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,389
values that i can collect from house one
to house n

662
00:15:00,389 --> 00:15:00,399
to house n
 

663
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,750
to house n
you know between this range f1 equals

664
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:03,760
you know between this range f1 equals
 

665
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,350
you know between this range f1 equals
one

666
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:05,360
one
 

667
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,470
one
f1 equals

668
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:08,480
f1 equals
 

669
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,550
f1 equals
the house one yeah yeah because they

670
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:10,560
the house one yeah yeah because they
 

671
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,389
the house one yeah yeah because they
look if there's only half one house and

672
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:12,399
look if there's only half one house and
 

673
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,710
look if there's only half one house and
then i can pick it i either pick it yeah

674
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:14,720
then i can pick it i either pick it yeah
 

675
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,230
then i can pick it i either pick it yeah
yeah because if i don't pick it i go

676
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:16,240
yeah because if i don't pick it i go
 

677
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,150
yeah because if i don't pick it i go
nothing i pick it

678
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:18,160
nothing i pick it
 

679
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,069
nothing i pick it
yeah also will be house one okay

680
00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:22,079
yeah also will be house one okay
 

681
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,350
yeah also will be house one okay
okay f2 equals one

682
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:25,360
okay f2 equals one
 

683
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,389
okay f2 equals one
so there are two houses so

684
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:28,399
so there are two houses so
 

685
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,590
so there are two houses so
which way the biggest yes we'll begin so

686
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:31,600
which way the biggest yes we'll begin so
 

687
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,550
which way the biggest yes we'll begin so
there will be max

688
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:32,560
there will be max
 

689
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,790
there will be max
of house one and house two right

690
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:36,800
of house one and house two right
 

691
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,870
of house one and house two right
yeah yeah because there are two houses i

692
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:38,880
yeah yeah because there are two houses i
 

693
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,629
yeah yeah because there are two houses i
can pick pick one or two it doesn't

694
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:40,639
can pick pick one or two it doesn't
 

695
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,430
can pick pick one or two it doesn't
matter

696
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:41,440
matter
 

697
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,790
matter
so look if fn houses so how horse you

698
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:44,800
so look if fn houses so how horse you
 

699
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,470
so look if fn houses so how horse you
will write it

700
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:48,480

 

701
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,829

okay i i look up

702
00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:52,839

 

703
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:55,509

fn so if i pick it what's

704
00:15:55,509 --> 00:15:55,519
fn so if i pick it what's
 

705
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,790
fn so if i pick it what's
what's the value if i pick it

706
00:15:58,790 --> 00:15:58,800
what's the value if i pick it
 

707
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,430
what's the value if i pick it
and then house n so if i pick it what's

708
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:01,440
and then house n so if i pick it what's
 

709
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,670
and then house n so if i pick it what's
the value

710
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:03,680
the value
 

711
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,470
the value
f pick it that will be house n right

712
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:08,480
f pick it that will be house n right
 

713
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,749
f pick it that will be house n right
house n yeah i pick it yeah

714
00:16:11,749 --> 00:16:11,759
house n yeah i pick it yeah
 

715
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,350
house n yeah i pick it yeah
yeah and plus

716
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:15,360
yeah and plus
 

717
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:22,230
yeah and plus
which value plus we usually

718
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:22,240
which value plus we usually
 

719
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,590
which value plus we usually
this bit what's this bit

720
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:25,600
this bit what's this bit
 

721
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,550
this bit what's this bit
uh so i picked the house end

722
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:30,560
uh so i picked the house end
 

723
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,790
uh so i picked the house end
and i i can't take this house n minus

724
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:32,800
and i i can't take this house n minus
 

725
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,230
and i i can't take this house n minus
one but i can

726
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:34,240
one but i can
 

727
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,710
one but i can
i can pick i can i can check those

728
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:36,720
i can pick i can i can check those
 

729
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,829
i can pick i can i can check those
values so which

730
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:37,839
values so which
 

731
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,110
values so which
this is the sub problem of which what

732
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:41,120
this is the sub problem of which what
 

733
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,069
this is the sub problem of which what
f as what look fn

734
00:16:46,069 --> 00:16:46,079
f as what look fn
 

735
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,230
f as what look fn
i pick this one i can't pick this one so

736
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:48,240
i pick this one i can't pick this one so
 

737
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,430
i pick this one i can't pick this one so
what's this this bit

738
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:49,440
what's this this bit
 

739
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,389
what's this this bit
this problem f and and y and minus

740
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:54,399
this problem f and and y and minus
 

741
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,110
this problem f and and y and minus
two yeah we're gonna be confident look

742
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:57,120
two yeah we're gonna be confident look
 

743
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,069
two yeah we're gonna be confident look
yes okay

744
00:16:58,069 --> 00:16:58,079
yes okay
 

745
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,629
yes okay
so i i pick this half and i can pick

746
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:00,639
so i i pick this half and i can pick
 

747
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,069
so i i pick this half and i can pick
this n minus one

748
00:17:02,069 --> 00:17:02,079
this n minus one
 

749
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,110
this n minus one
but i can pick this bit yeah which which

750
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:05,120
but i can pick this bit yeah which which
 

751
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:05,990
but i can pick this bit yeah which which
is the problem

752
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:06,000
is the problem
 

753
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,470
is the problem
f minus two yeah and

754
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:10,480
f minus two yeah and
 

755
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,669
f minus two yeah and
maximum of least if i don't

756
00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:13,679
maximum of least if i don't
 

757
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,390
maximum of least if i don't
if i don't pick this one so what should

758
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:16,400
if i don't pick this one so what should
 

759
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:16,949
if i don't pick this one so what should
i

760
00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:16,959
i
 

761
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,029
i
what's the value if i'm not picking this

762
00:17:19,029 --> 00:17:19,039
what's the value if i'm not picking this
 

763
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,470
what's the value if i'm not picking this
one

764
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:20,480
one
 

765
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,390
one
and what's this bit

766
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:24,400
and what's this bit
 

767
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,470
and what's this bit
if i don't pick this one then i i could

768
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:26,480
if i don't pick this one then i i could
 

769
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,309
if i don't pick this one then i i could
possibly pick this one and what's this

770
00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:28,319
possibly pick this one and what's this
 

771
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,950
possibly pick this one and what's this
problem

772
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:30,960

 

773
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:40,230

what's the biggest problem

774
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:40,240

 

775
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,789

fn the house end there's two choice i

776
00:17:42,789 --> 00:17:42,799
fn the house end there's two choice i
 

777
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:43,830
fn the house end there's two choice i
pick it

778
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:43,840
pick it
 

779
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,990
pick it
i pick it then the problem will be the

780
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:46,000
i pick it then the problem will be the
 

781
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,190
i pick it then the problem will be the
house n plus

782
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:47,200
house n plus
 

783
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,029
house n plus
f minus two yeah i don't know what

784
00:17:49,029 --> 00:17:49,039
f minus two yeah i don't know what
 

785
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,350
f minus two yeah i don't know what
happened here but i saw i know this is

786
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:51,360
happened here but i saw i know this is
 

787
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,230
happened here but i saw i know this is
the problem like

788
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:52,240
the problem like
 

789
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,590
the problem like
the answer for n minus two yeah or if i

790
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:55,600
the answer for n minus two yeah or if i
 

791
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,710
the answer for n minus two yeah or if i
don't pick it

792
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:56,720
don't pick it
 

793
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,710
don't pick it
if i don't pick it then the problem is f

794
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:58,720
if i don't pick it then the problem is f
 

795
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,390
if i don't pick it then the problem is f
and minus one yeah because

796
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:00,400
and minus one yeah because
 

797
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,350
and minus one yeah because
i don't care what happened here but if i

798
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:03,360
i don't care what happened here but if i
 

799
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,630
i don't care what happened here but if i
don't pick this one

800
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:04,640
don't pick this one
 

801
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,430
don't pick this one
then the the maximum value i can get is

802
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:07,440
then the the maximum value i can get is
 

803
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:07,909
then the the maximum value i can get is
from this

804
00:18:07,909 --> 00:18:07,919
from this
 

805
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,270
from this
this bit yeah what's this

806
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:11,280
this bit yeah what's this
 

807
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,110
this bit yeah what's this
dynamic programming equation so we can

808
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:13,120
dynamic programming equation so we can
 

809
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,270
dynamic programming equation so we can
just solve it we think this look this is

810
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:15,280
just solve it we think this look this is
 

811
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,669
just solve it we think this look this is
the terminal condition f1 f2

812
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:17,679
the terminal condition f1 f2
 

813
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,430
the terminal condition f1 f2
you know you know how to solve the base

814
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:21,440
you know you know how to solve the base
 

815
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,230
you know you know how to solve the base
condition small the smallest problem f1

816
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:24,240
condition small the smallest problem f1
 

817
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,150
condition small the smallest problem f1
f2 right

818
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:26,160
f2 right
 

819
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,350
f2 right
and then now we have n and the f

820
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:29,360
and then now we have n and the f
 

821
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,630
and then now we have n and the f
n can be divided into a smaller problem

822
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:32,640
n can be divided into a smaller problem
 

823
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,630
n can be divided into a smaller problem
yeah you see look in order to calculate

824
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:34,640
yeah you see look in order to calculate
 

825
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,470
yeah you see look in order to calculate
f n

826
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:36,480
f n
 

827
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,190
f n
we we we want to calculate f minus to an

828
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:39,200
we we we want to calculate f minus to an
 

829
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:39,590
we we we want to calculate f minus to an
s

830
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:39,600
s
 

831
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,789
s
n minus one so this seems uh

832
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:42,799
n minus one so this seems uh
 

833
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,430
n minus one so this seems uh
looks similar to a fibonacci number yeah

834
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:45,440
looks similar to a fibonacci number yeah
 

835
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,870
looks similar to a fibonacci number yeah
instead of this slightly different we

836
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:46,880
instead of this slightly different we
 

837
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,470
instead of this slightly different we
need to add the value the value the

838
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:48,480
need to add the value the value the
 

839
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,190
need to add the value the value the
value of the house are known

840
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:51,200
value of the house are known
 

841
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,870
value of the house are known
yeah okay does it make sense

842
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:54,880
yeah okay does it make sense
 

843
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,870
yeah okay does it make sense
what's the complexity if we're using the

844
00:18:58,870 --> 00:18:58,880
what's the complexity if we're using the
 

845
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,990
what's the complexity if we're using the
notebook thing yeah do you get it we are

846
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:02,000
notebook thing yeah do you get it we are
 

847
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,190
notebook thing yeah do you get it we are
talking about the mooc

848
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:03,200
talking about the mooc
 

849
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,230
talking about the mooc
minimization what's the complexity

850
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:06,240
minimization what's the complexity
 

851
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,270
minimization what's the complexity
oh yeah when because they are

852
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:09,280
oh yeah when because they are
 

853
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,470
oh yeah when because they are
why is online

854
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:12,480

 

855
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,029

and then each for each house fn is only

856
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:15,039
and then each for each house fn is only
 

857
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,870
and then each for each house fn is only
calculated

858
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:16,880
calculated
 

859
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,150
calculated
how many times

860
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:20,160

 

861
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:26,230

uh how many times

862
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:26,240

 

863
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,750

we're using the notebook why are we

864
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:27,760
we're using the notebook why are we
 

865
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,510
we're using the notebook why are we
using the notebook

866
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:29,520
using the notebook
 

867
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,830
using the notebook
we are going to remember it yeah yeah so

868
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:31,840
we are going to remember it yeah yeah so
 

869
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,029
we are going to remember it yeah yeah so
for each house

870
00:19:33,029 --> 00:19:33,039
for each house
 

871
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:37,110
for each house
this only calculate how many times

872
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:37,120

 

873
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,750

what yes yes that's why we use a number

874
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:39,760
what yes yes that's why we use a number
 

875
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,350
what yes yes that's why we use a number
okay let's try this

876
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:41,360
okay let's try this
 

877
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:47,510
okay let's try this
so it's simple okay

878
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:47,520

 

879
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,070

okay i'm going to write it okay look

880
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:50,080
okay i'm going to write it okay look
 

881
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,350
okay i'm going to write it okay look
define

882
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:51,360
define
 

883
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,150
define
let's say f4 function and then we have

884
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:54,160
let's say f4 function and then we have
 

885
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,190
let's say f4 function and then we have
the

886
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:55,200
the
 

887
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,470
the
house value okay house value yeah

888
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:58,480
house value okay house value yeah
 

889
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:03,750
house value okay house value yeah
house value and then

890
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:03,760

 

891
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,789

okay let's maybe just do the uh

892
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:06,799
okay let's maybe just do the uh
 

893
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:10,310
okay let's maybe just do the uh
value okay valuable right value

894
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:10,320
value okay valuable right value
 

895
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,669
value okay valuable right value
comma okay so the length n will be lens

896
00:20:13,669 --> 00:20:13,679
comma okay so the length n will be lens
 

897
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,029
comma okay so the length n will be lens
all right yeah

898
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:17,039
all right yeah
 

899
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,070
all right yeah
yeah the lens how many houses okay

900
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:20,080
yeah the lens how many houses okay
 

901
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,230
yeah the lens how many houses okay
this is a list of numbers yeah v will be

902
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:22,240
this is a list of numbers yeah v will be
 

903
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,750
this is a list of numbers yeah v will be
like one two three

904
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:23,760
like one two three
 

905
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,110
like one two three
zero five seven yeah you'll be like that

906
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,120
zero five seven yeah you'll be like that
 

907
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:27,590
zero five seven yeah you'll be like that
yeah

908
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:27,600
yeah
 

909
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,470
yeah
okay and then n dance n will be one two

910
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:30,480
okay and then n dance n will be one two
 

911
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,230
okay and then n dance n will be one two
three four five so what's n here

912
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:32,240
three four five so what's n here
 

913
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,070
three four five so what's n here
what's the value and

914
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:36,080

 

915
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,990

what's the value of n equals length v

916
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:38,000
what's the value of n equals length v
 

917
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,950
what's the value of n equals length v
what's the value i went

918
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:40,960
what's the value i went
 

919
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,470
what's the value i went
blank how many elements left five

920
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:44,480
blank how many elements left five
 

921
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,390
blank how many elements left five
so lowest n five yeah it's easy okay now

922
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:48,400
so lowest n five yeah it's easy okay now
 

923
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,149
so lowest n five yeah it's easy okay now
we need to create a array okay let's say

924
00:20:52,149 --> 00:20:52,159
we need to create a array okay let's say
 

925
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:55,190
we need to create a array okay let's say
uh dynamic programming array okay

926
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:55,200
uh dynamic programming array okay
 

927
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,230
uh dynamic programming array okay
dynamic problem

928
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:56,240
dynamic problem
 

929
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,110
dynamic problem
already equals zero initially for each

930
00:20:59,110 --> 00:20:59,120
already equals zero initially for each
 

931
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,110
already equals zero initially for each
value is zero locally syntax

932
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:01,120
value is zero locally syntax
 

933
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,549
value is zero locally syntax
bracket zero but times we use that star

934
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:04,559
bracket zero but times we use that star
 

935
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,430
bracket zero but times we use that star
times n so what it means is that n is

936
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:07,440
times n so what it means is that n is
 

937
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,110
times n so what it means is that n is
five and after this

938
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:09,120
five and after this
 

939
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,270
five and after this
we're creating an array of five so we

940
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:11,280
we're creating an array of five so we
 

941
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,710
we're creating an array of five so we
which will be zero

942
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:12,720
which will be zero
 

943
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,310
which will be zero
zero zero zero zero got it

944
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:16,320
zero zero zero zero got it
 

945
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,310
zero zero zero zero got it
yeah so after this dp is this yeah yeah

946
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:20,320
yeah so after this dp is this yeah yeah
 

947
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,230
yeah so after this dp is this yeah yeah
is it simple yeah times n yeah

948
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:24,240
is it simple yeah times n yeah
 

949
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,630
is it simple yeah times n yeah
a bracket a bucket with number zero

950
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:26,640
a bracket a bucket with number zero
 

951
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,630
a bracket a bucket with number zero
times five equals this

952
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:28,640
times five equals this
 

953
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,669
times five equals this
okay yeah okay okay now

954
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:33,679

 

955
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,870

let's look

956
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:36,880
let's look
 

957
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,470
let's look
if n equals zero

958
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:40,480
if n equals zero
 

959
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,789
if n equals zero
okay we return zero okay if there's no

960
00:21:42,789 --> 00:21:42,799
okay we return zero okay if there's no
 

961
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,149
okay we return zero okay if there's no
houses we return zero

962
00:21:44,149 --> 00:21:44,159
houses we return zero
 

963
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,430
houses we return zero
okay yes

964
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:47,440
okay yes
 

965
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,990
okay yes
actually this should go here okay it

966
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:50,000
actually this should go here okay it
 

967
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,789
actually this should go here okay it
doesn't matter

968
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:50,799
doesn't matter
 

969
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,630
doesn't matter
if n equals one what should we return

970
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:54,640
if n equals one what should we return
 

971
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,230
if n equals one what should we return
if there is only one house it's once we

972
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:56,240
if there is only one house it's once we
 

973
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,510
if there is only one house it's once we
return

974
00:21:59,510 --> 00:21:59,520

 

975
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,630

so which is v 0 yeah

976
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:02,640
so which is v 0 yeah
 

977
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,830
so which is v 0 yeah
v 0 is the first house if n

978
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:05,840
v 0 is the first house if n
 

979
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,510
v 0 is the first house if n
equals 2 return

980
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:09,520
equals 2 return
 

981
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,789
equals 2 return
so how do we write it return next

982
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:12,799
so how do we write it return next
 

983
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:16,310
so how do we write it return next
v0 and v1

984
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:16,320
v0 and v1
 

985
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,350
v0 and v1
one one okay now at least

986
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:19,360
one one okay now at least
 

987
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,710
one one okay now at least
this is okay and then what return

988
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:22,720
this is okay and then what return
 

989
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,510
this is okay and then what return
yeah the thing i want to pick the

990
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:25,520
yeah the thing i want to pick the
 

991
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,149
yeah the thing i want to pick the
maximum

992
00:22:26,149 --> 00:22:26,159
maximum
 

993
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:35,110
maximum

994
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:35,120

 

995
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,830

actually we are missing the parameter

996
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:38,840
actually we are missing the parameter
 

997
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,710
actually we are missing the parameter
here

998
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:40,720
here
 

999
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,870
here
we are missing a parameter uh actually i

1000
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:42,880
we are missing a parameter uh actually i
 

1001
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,230
we are missing a parameter uh actually i
only pick

1002
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:44,240
only pick
 

1003
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,510
only pick
pic k okay now it's k

1004
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:47,520
pic k okay now it's k
 

1005
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,270
pic k okay now it's k
so look this will be uh

1006
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:51,280
so look this will be uh
 

1007
00:22:51,280 --> 00:23:00,310
so look this will be uh
because because it's not n so n is

1008
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:00,320

 

1009
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:08,310

how can we write this better

1010
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:08,320
how can we write this better
 

1011
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,820
how can we write this better
so look uh if n equals uh

1012
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:10,830
so look uh if n equals uh
 

1013
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:13,430
so look uh if n equals uh

00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,470
so actually this value should be put
outside

okay so so look if n

1020
00:23:22,149 --> 00:23:22,159
okay so so look if n
 

1021
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:22,440
okay so so look if n

i'm currently okay so the house value
 

1039
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,909
i'm currently okay so the house value
will be vk

1045
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,110
k minus 2 right or if i don't pick it
so it will be f v k minus 1

1046
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:57,120
so it will be f v k minus 1
 

1047
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,549
so it will be f v k minus 1
right yeah yes

00:24:00,549 --> 00:24:00,559
right yeah yes
 

1049
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:03,990
right yeah yes
come on come on yeah okay so now

1050
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:04,000
come on come on yeah okay so now
 

1051
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,350
come on come on yeah okay so now
so we can call this is fv

1052
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:07,360
so we can call this is fv
 

1053
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,909
so we can call this is fv
then length v minus one because we are

1054
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:11,919
then length v minus one because we are
 

1055
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,669
then length v minus one because we are
getting that so we don't need that dp

1056
00:24:13,669 --> 00:24:13,679
getting that so we don't need that dp
 

1057
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,269
getting that so we don't need that dp
value yeah because look it will

1058
00:24:15,269 --> 00:24:15,279
value yeah because look it will
 

1059
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,390
value yeah because look it will
be going it will be the space condition

1060
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:18,400
be going it will be the space condition
 

1061
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,269
be going it will be the space condition
here yeah

1062
00:24:19,269 --> 00:24:19,279
here yeah
 

1063
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,230
here yeah
so what's missing here if i implement

1064
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:22,240
so what's missing here if i implement
 

1065
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,710
so what's missing here if i implement
this what's the complexity

1066
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:24,720
this what's the complexity
 

1067
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:31,110
this what's the complexity
what's the complexity

1068
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:31,120

 

1069
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,190

because this is recursion we don't need

1070
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:33,200
because this is recursion we don't need
 

1071
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,510
because this is recursion we don't need
to let dp array but i can show you later

1072
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:35,520
to let dp array but i can show you later
 

1073
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,149
to let dp array but i can show you later
why we

1074
00:24:36,149 --> 00:24:36,159
why we
 

1075
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,909
why we
we need it in the top bottom of dynamic

1076
00:24:39,909 --> 00:24:39,919
we need it in the top bottom of dynamic
 

1077
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,390
we need it in the top bottom of dynamic
programming this is top down remember

1078
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:42,400
programming this is top down remember
 

1079
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,269
programming this is top down remember
top down because in order to calculate f

1080
00:24:45,269 --> 00:24:45,279
top down because in order to calculate f
 

1081
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:46,390
top down because in order to calculate f
n we need to calculate

1082
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:46,400
n we need to calculate
 

1083
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,110
n we need to calculate
f n minus 1 and f y minus 2 yeah and

1084
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:49,120
f n minus 1 and f y minus 2 yeah and
 

1085
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,029
f n minus 1 and f y minus 2 yeah and
this is the equation yeah

1086
00:24:51,029 --> 00:24:51,039
this is the equation yeah
 

1087
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,230
this is the equation yeah
okay what's missing what's missing here

1088
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:54,240
okay what's missing what's missing here
 

1089
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,390
okay what's missing what's missing here
we need to catch it easily

actually you can just do cash yeah this
 

1097
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,390
actually you can just do cash yeah this
cash string is equals to

cash string is equals to
 

1099
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,750
cash string is equals to
f a i u cash

now okay this is the same thing needs to

1102
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:14,080
now okay this is the same thing needs to
 

1103
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:14,870
now okay this is the same thing needs to
this is your

1104

00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:17,760
cache oh we can we can do this using the
 

1107
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,430
cache oh we can we can do this using the
notebook yeah remember

1108
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:19,440
notebook yeah remember
 

1109
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,789
notebook yeah remember
yeah yeah no book

1110
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:22,799
yeah yeah no book
 

1111
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:27,269
yeah yeah no book
yes no book and if

1112
00:25:27,269 --> 00:25:27,279
yes no book and if
 

1113
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,789
yes no book and if
notebook equal uh if okay actually

1114
00:25:30,789 --> 00:25:30,799
notebook equal uh if okay actually
 

1115
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,590
notebook equal uh if okay actually
if we move this v outside we don't need

1116
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:33,600
if we move this v outside we don't need
 

1117
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,149
if we move this v outside we don't need
to pass

1118
00:25:34,149 --> 00:25:34,159
to pass
 

1119
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,149
to pass
v it's not changing this no one right

1120
00:25:36,149 --> 00:25:36,159
v it's not changing this no one right
 

1121
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,590
v it's not changing this no one right
away the house

1122
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:37,600
away the house
 

1123
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,630
away the house
value is known so we k

1124
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:40,640
value is known so we k
 

1125
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:47,110
value is known so we k
this is just fk yeah got it

1126
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:47,120

 

1127
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,230

so if this value is is outside if you

1128
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:50,240
so if this value is is outside if you
 

1129
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,510
so if this value is is outside if you
want to reference it

1130
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:51,520
want to reference it
 

1131
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:56,710
want to reference it
we need to use the global keyword global

1132
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:56,720
we need to use the global keyword global
 

1133
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,590
we need to use the global keyword global
v okay so look using the notebook then

1134
00:25:59,590 --> 00:25:59,600
v okay so look using the notebook then
 

1135
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,750
v okay so look using the notebook then
we can we can do this if k in notebook

1136
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:01,760
we can we can do this if k in notebook
 

1137
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,590
we can we can do this if k in notebook
we do turn notebook k

1138
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:03,600
we do turn notebook k
 

1139
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,350
we do turn notebook k
and then before returning the value we

1140
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:05,360
and then before returning the value we
 

1141
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,029
and then before returning the value we
save this into a value

1142
00:26:07,029 --> 00:26:07,039
save this into a value
 

1143
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:10,549
save this into a value
and then notebook k equals value return

1144
00:26:10,549 --> 00:26:10,559
and then notebook k equals value return
 

1145
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,390
and then notebook k equals value return
value all right i'm going to write it

1146
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:12,400
value all right i'm going to write it
 

1147
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,669
value all right i'm going to write it
it's quite similar

1148
00:26:13,669 --> 00:26:13,679
it's quite similar
 

1149
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,149
it's quite similar
than yesterday okay so i'm talking about

1150
00:26:16,149 --> 00:26:16,159
than yesterday okay so i'm talking about
 

1151
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:17,909
than yesterday okay so i'm talking about
uh

1152
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:17,919
uh
 

1153
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,190
uh
the okay um look i talked a little bit

1154

the okay um look i talked a little bit
 

1155
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,310
the okay um look i talked a little bit
about the python here look eric

1156
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:24,320
about the python here look eric
 

1157
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,590
about the python here look eric
define this is a function f yeah with

1158
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:27,600
define this is a function f yeah with
 

1159
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,470
define this is a function f yeah with
nothing

1160
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:28,480
nothing
 

1161
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,149
nothing
and if i want to print

1162
00:26:32,149 --> 00:26:32,159

 

1163
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,590

uh array here yeah i don't care

1164
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:35,600
uh array here yeah i don't care
 

1165
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,390
uh array here yeah i don't care
m is defined outside this function area

1166
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:38,400
m is defined outside this function area
 

1167
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,909
m is defined outside this function area
equals

1168
00:26:39,909 --> 00:26:39,919
equals
 

1169
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:44,230
equals
eight okay yeah yeah

1170
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:44,240
eight okay yeah yeah
 

1171
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,590
eight okay yeah yeah
and this confusing number look

1172
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:47,600
and this confusing number look
 

1173
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,230
and this confusing number look
yeah okay look this is not going to work

1174
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:50,240
yeah okay look this is not going to work
 

1175
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,190
yeah okay look this is not going to work
why is that

1176
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:51,200
why is that
 

1177
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,870
why is that
because this function is in the scope

1178
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:54,880
because this function is in the scope
 

1179
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,789
because this function is in the scope
in the stone different than this

1180
00:26:58,789 --> 00:26:58,799
in the stone different than this
 

1181
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,750
in the stone different than this
but in order to use eric here i need to

1182
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:01,760
but in order to use eric here i need to
 

1183
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,190
but in order to use eric here i need to
i need to add a keyword global

1184
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:05,200
i need to add a keyword global
 

1185
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,789
i need to add a keyword global
globa eric that means i

1186
00:27:08,789 --> 00:27:08,799
globa eric that means i
 

1187
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,029
globa eric that means i
i want to use eric and then print area

1188
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:11,039
i want to use eric and then print area
 

1189
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:11,990
i want to use eric and then print area
will be eight

1190
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:12,000
will be eight
 

1191
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,549
will be eight
if i don't at least how does if i don't

1192
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:14,559
if i don't at least how does if i don't
 

1193
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:15,190
if i don't at least how does if i don't
at least

1194
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:15,200
at least
 

1195
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,430
at least
this will print these will be

1196
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:19,440
this will print these will be
 

1197
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,310
this will print these will be
a reference it will be none okay you you

1198
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:22,320
a reference it will be none okay you you
 

1199
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,029
a reference it will be none okay you you
because if

1200
00:27:23,029 --> 00:27:23,039
because if
 

1201
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:26,230
because if
this area only lives here yeah

1202
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:26,240
this area only lives here yeah
 

1203
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,590
this area only lives here yeah
it doesn't mean outside and then then if

1204
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:29,600
it doesn't mean outside and then then if
 

1205
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,110
it doesn't mean outside and then then if
you want to use outside you have to tell

1206
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:31,120
you want to use outside you have to tell
 

1207
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,870
you want to use outside you have to tell
computer okay i want to use the area

1208
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:32,880
computer okay i want to use the area
 

1209
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,310
computer okay i want to use the area
from outside which is i need to add a

1210
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:34,320
from outside which is i need to add a
 

1211
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:34,789
from outside which is i need to add a
globe

00:27:34,789 --> 00:27:34,799
globe
 

1213
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:38,310
globe
it's in a global scope okay yeah

1214
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:38,320
it's in a global scope okay yeah
 

1215
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,350
it's in a global scope okay yeah
okay this is one thing

look define
 

1225
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,830
look define
f you can put a value here n yeah look

1226
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:53,840
f you can put a value here n yeah look
 

1227
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,710
f you can put a value here n yeah look
come on and then you can print all right

1228
00:27:58,710 --> 00:27:58,720

 

1229
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,310

okay if i do this look yeah

1230
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:02,320
okay if i do this look yeah
 

1231
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,990
okay if i do this look yeah
yeah now that's okay because this area

1232
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:06,000
yeah now that's okay because this area
 

1233
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,470
yeah now that's okay because this area
is this area and then in order to call

1234
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:08,480
is this area and then in order to call
 

1235
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,590
is this area and then in order to call
this you have to call this

1236
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:09,600
this you have to call this
 

1237
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,029
this you have to call this
f eric yeah right and then you will take

1238
00:28:13,029 --> 00:28:13,039
f eric yeah right and then you will take
 

1239
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:13,750
f eric yeah right and then you will take
this arrow

1240
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:13,760
this arrow
 

1241
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,950
this arrow
value pass it into the function

1242
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:16,960
value pass it into the function
 

1243
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,510
value pass it into the function
then you put the array which is a do you

1244
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:19,520
then you put the array which is a do you
 

1245
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,549
then you put the array which is a do you
get it

1246
00:28:20,549 --> 00:28:20,559
get it
 

1247
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,950
get it
yeah okay this is passing these

1248
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:22,960
yeah okay this is passing these
 

1249
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,630
yeah okay this is passing these
parameters

1250
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:24,640
parameters
 

1251
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,350
parameters
okay so previously this is that was top

1252
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:27,360
okay so previously this is that was top
 

1253
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,230
okay so previously this is that was top
down

1254
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:28,240
down
 

1255
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,950
down
top down yeah top down the left corner

00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:30,960
top down yeah top down the left corner
 

1257
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,950
top down yeah top down the left corner
if we want to calculate fn we calculate

1258
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:32,960
if we want to calculate fn we calculate
 

1259
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,710
if we want to calculate fn we calculate
f1 minus one and five minus

1260
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:34,720
f1 minus one and five minus
 

1261
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,310
f1 minus one and five minus
and the the other the other way of

1262
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:36,320
and the the other the other way of
 

1263
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,669
and the the other the other way of
calculating it which is called

1264
00:28:39,669 --> 00:28:39,679
calculating it which is called
 

1265
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,630
calculating it which is called
the other direction of dynamic power

1266
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:42,640
the other direction of dynamic power
 

1267
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,350
the other direction of dynamic power
button

1268
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:43,360
button
 

1269
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,789
button
yeah so in in order to

1270
00:28:46,789 --> 00:28:46,799
yeah so in in order to
 

1271
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:50,870
yeah so in in order to
do it the house is here i can just

1272
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:50,880
do it the house is here i can just
 

1273
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,470
do it the house is here i can just
start here start here and then i can

1274
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:52,480
start here start here and then i can
 

1275
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,149
start here start here and then i can
calculate from the left to the right

1276
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:54,159
calculate from the left to the right
 

1277
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:58,310
calculate from the left to the right
from the f1 f2 to fn right

1278
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:58,320
from the f1 f2 to fn right
 

1279
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,909
from the f1 f2 to fn right
yes yeah okay so

1280
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:01,919
yes yeah okay so
 

1281
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,149
yes yeah okay so
that one will be we love the recursion

1282
00:29:04,149 --> 00:29:04,159
that one will be we love the recursion
 

1283
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,110
that one will be we love the recursion
yeah okay so let's do this define

1284
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:07,120
yeah okay so let's do this define
 

1285
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,630
yeah okay so let's do this define
i have and we have the houses and we

1286
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:10,640
i have and we have the houses and we
 

1287
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,310
i have and we have the houses and we
have houses okay so now again

1288
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:14,320
have houses okay so now again
 

1289
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,590
have houses okay so now again
we now we need to do this length equal v

1290
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:17,600
we now we need to do this length equal v
 

1291
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,110
we now we need to do this length equal v
yeah okay and then now dp this is the

1292
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:21,120
yeah okay and then now dp this is the
 

1293
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,750
yeah okay and then now dp this is the
value of dp db equals zero

1294
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:23,760
value of dp db equals zero
 

1295
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,990
value of dp db equals zero
times n so we have an array a way to

1296
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:26,000
times n so we have an array a way to
 

1297
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,190
times n so we have an array a way to
keep those values

1298
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:27,200
keep those values
 

1299
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,669
keep those values
all right yeah to keep a reverse value

1300
00:29:29,669 --> 00:29:29,679
all right yeah to keep a reverse value
 

1301
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:32,230
all right yeah to keep a reverse value
and then

1302
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:32,240

 

1303
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,110

and again i'm not going to write it if n

1304
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:35,120
and again i'm not going to write it if n
 

1305
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:35,750
and again i'm not going to write it if n
equal

1306
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:35,760
equal
 

1307
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,630
equal
if n equals one okay okay let's write if

1308
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:38,640
if n equals one okay okay let's write if
 

1309
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,990
if n equals one okay okay let's write if
n equals

1310
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:40,000
n equals
 

1311
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,070
n equals
one return at return what

1312
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:44,080
one return at return what
 

1313
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:48,630
one return at return what
v zero yeah yeah

1314
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:48,640
v zero yeah yeah
 

1315
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,990
v zero yeah yeah
this should be put in the power

1316
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:52,000
this should be put in the power
 

1317
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,870
this should be put in the power
uh before that if n equals zero what's

1318
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:54,880
uh before that if n equals zero what's
 

1319
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,350
uh before that if n equals zero what's
your return

1320
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:57,360
your return
 

1321
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,510
your return
return here if n

1322
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:01,520
return here if n
 

1323
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,950
return here if n
equals two return

1324
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:04,960

 

1325
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:12,470

return max

1326
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:12,480

 

1327
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,990

yeah okay now this is interesting

1328
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:16,000
yeah okay now this is interesting
 

1329
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,350
yeah okay now this is interesting
and then we can loop it yeah for

1330
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:19,360
and then we can loop it yeah for
 

1331
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,710
and then we can loop it yeah for
i in range

1332
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:22,720
i in range
 

1333
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,630
i in range
start from one start from one

1334
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:26,640
start from one start from one
 

1335
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:32,310
start from one start from one
b zero starts from number two we

1336
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:32,320

 

1337
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,950

start from

1338
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:36,960
start from
 

1339
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,350
start from
uh start from two yeah two and then end

1340
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:41,360
uh start from two yeah two and then end
 

1341
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:46,470
uh start from two yeah two and then end
look we just return it yeah but actually

1342
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:46,480

 

1343
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,870

actually we also need to do this if n

1344
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:48,880
actually we also need to do this if n
 

1345
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,549
actually we also need to do this if n
and and here

1346
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:50,559
and and here
 

1347
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:53,909
and and here
here i need to do this d p zero

1348
00:30:53,909 --> 00:30:53,919
here i need to do this d p zero
 

1349
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:57,669
here i need to do this d p zero
equals d p zero equals v zero

1350
00:30:57,669 --> 00:30:57,679
equals d p zero equals v zero
 

1351
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:02,070
equals d p zero equals v zero
and d p one equals max

1352
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:02,080
and d p one equals max
 

1353
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,909
and d p one equals max
v zero v1 right

1354
00:31:05,909 --> 00:31:05,919
v zero v1 right
 

1355
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:10,070
v zero v1 right
yeah so that array that array

1356
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:10,080
yeah so that array that array
 

1357
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,549
yeah so that array that array
remember this tp array yeah beginning

1358
00:31:12,549 --> 00:31:12,559
remember this tp array yeah beginning
 

1359
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:13,990
remember this tp array yeah beginning
with the values i need to

1360
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:14,000
with the values i need to
 

1361
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,389
with the values i need to
update the first two values yeah this

1362
00:31:16,389 --> 00:31:16,399
update the first two values yeah this
 

1363
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:17,430
update the first two values yeah this
first this

1364
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:17,440
first this
 

1365
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,430
first this
first value would be v 0 yeah because

1366
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:19,440
first value would be v 0 yeah because
 

1367
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,630
first value would be v 0 yeah because
the

1368
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:20,640
the
 

1369
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,590
the
if i pick the the first house i can only

1370
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:23,600
if i pick the the first house i can only
 

1371
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,630
if i pick the the first house i can only
pick one right

1372
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:24,640
pick one right
 

1373
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,870
pick one right
the second house that's the same value

1374
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:26,880
the second house that's the same value
 

1375
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,470
the second house that's the same value
would be max

1376
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:28,480
would be max
 

1377
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,750
would be max
of v0 and v1 right yeah

1378
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:31,760
of v0 and v1 right yeah
 

1379
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,830
of v0 and v1 right yeah
and then start from two start from two

1380
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:35,840
and then start from two start from two
 

1381
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,029
and then start from two start from two
start from two look this is the magic

1382
00:31:39,029 --> 00:31:39,039
start from two look this is the magic
 

1383
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:43,750
start from two look this is the magic
dp i dpi

1384
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:43,760
dp i dpi
 

1385
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,909
dp i dpi
equals max can you can you say

1386
00:31:47,909 --> 00:31:47,919
equals max can you can you say
 

1387
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,950
equals max can you can you say
it's almost finished dpi equals max 1

1388
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:50,960
it's almost finished dpi equals max 1

1394
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:01,840
i pick this house and what's the value i
 

1395
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,950
i pick this house and what's the value i
need to

1396
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:02,960
need to
 

1397
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,070
need to
get i v

i plus dp1
 

1401
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,990
i plus dp1
i pick the half and then dp what's the

1402
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:12,000
i pick the half and then dp what's the
 

1403
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,630
i pick the half and then dp what's the
smaller problem i need to add

1404
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:14,640
smaller problem i need to add
 

1405
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,110
smaller problem i need to add
even better i pick this house and then i

1406
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:17,120
even better i pick this house and then i
 

1407
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,149
even better i pick this house and then i
need to

1408

need to
 

1409
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:20,230
need to
it's the the total value i can have up

1410
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:20,240
it's the the total value i can have up
 

1411
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,430
it's the the total value i can have up
to this point is

1412
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:21,440
to this point is
 

1413
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,269
to this point is
this house picking this part and the

1414
00:32:23,269 --> 00:32:23,279
this house picking this part and the
 

1415
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:26,090
this house picking this part and the
preview is what

1416
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:26,100
preview is what

1419
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,870

yes and then or i pick i don't pick this

1420
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:44,880
yes and then or i pick i don't pick this
 

1421
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,590
yes and then or i pick i don't pick this
house and

1422
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:45,600
house and
 

1423
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:50,470
house and
which is dp1 and then i can dpi

1424
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:50,480
which is dp1 and then i can dpi
 

1425
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,750
which is dp1 and then i can dpi
one yeah okay so let now return

1426
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:53,760
one yeah okay so let now return
 

1427
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,870
one yeah okay so let now return
determine which value return this this

1428
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:56,880
determine which value return this this
 

1429
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,509
determine which value return this this
is the dp array i i calculated

1430
00:32:59,509 --> 00:32:59,519
is the dp array i i calculated
 

1431
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,549
is the dp array i i calculated
along the way which value is in return

1432
00:33:02,549 --> 00:33:02,559
along the way which value is in return
 

1433
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:05,750
along the way which value is in return
dp1 the last value yeah

1434
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:05,760
dp1 the last value yeah
 

1435
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,070
dp1 the last value yeah
because i the in-house i want the last

1436
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:08,080
because i the in-house i want the last
 

1437
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,590
because i the in-house i want the last
value will be the

1438
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:09,600
value will be the
 

1439
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,669
value will be the
maximum value i can get for this end

1440
00:33:11,669 --> 00:33:11,679
maximum value i can get for this end
 

1441
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:13,110
maximum value i can get for this end
house so dp

1442
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:13,120
house so dp
 

1443
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,990
house so dp
db1 the last value what should i put

1444
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:16,000
db1 the last value what should i put
 

1445
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,509
db1 the last value what should i put
here

1446
00:33:17,509 --> 00:33:17,519
here
 

1447
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,110
here
what that was the last value the first

1448
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:19,120
what that was the last value the first
 

1449
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,549
what that was the last value the first
one is minus one

1450
00:33:20,549 --> 00:33:20,559
one is minus one
 

1451
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:24,230
one is minus one
we're done yes good job yes

1452
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:24,240
we're done yes good job yes
 

1453
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,350
we're done yes good job yes
so look this is bottom up

1454
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:27,360
so look this is bottom up
 

1455
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,509
so look this is bottom up
both of our dynamic programming we buy

1456
00:33:29,509 --> 00:33:29,519
both of our dynamic programming we buy
 

1457
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,269
both of our dynamic programming we buy
we feel english already remember the

1458
00:33:31,269 --> 00:33:31,279
we feel english already remember the
 

1459
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:32,710
we feel english already remember the
fibonacci number yeah

1460
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:32,720
fibonacci number yeah
 

1461
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,950
fibonacci number yeah
zero one two and we feel we start from

1462
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:34,960
zero one two and we feel we start from
 

1463
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,149
zero one two and we feel we start from
zero feeling that way

1464
00:33:36,149 --> 00:33:36,159
zero feeling that way
 

1465
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:38,389
zero feeling that way
the previous recursion which the

1466
00:33:38,389 --> 00:33:38,399
the previous recursion which the
 

1467
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,230
the previous recursion which the
notebook thing is the top down

1468
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:40,240
notebook thing is the top down
 

1469
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,870
notebook thing is the top down
starting from the the last one and going

1470
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:42,880
starting from the the last one and going
 

1471
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,990
starting from the the last one and going
backward this is going

1472
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:44,000
backward this is going
 

1473
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,269
backward this is going
starting from the beginning going

1474
00:33:45,269 --> 00:33:45,279
starting from the beginning going
 

1475
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:47,269
starting from the beginning going
forward and then we use the gonna write

1476
00:33:47,269 --> 00:33:47,279
forward and then we use the gonna write
 

1477
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:48,710
forward and then we use the gonna write
dp equals zero times

1478
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:48,720
dp equals zero times
 

1479
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,269
dp equals zero times
