so look considering these two if i call
 

45
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,350
so look considering these two if i call
them similar

46
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:09,360
them similar
 

47
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,469
them similar
how do you know why they are similar

48
00:01:14,469 --> 00:01:14,479

 

49
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,910

this one is super small okay okay

50
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:17,920
this one is super small okay okay
 

51
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,870
this one is super small okay okay
so given these two three if they are

52
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:20,880
so given these two three if they are
 

53
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,149
so given these two three if they are
little similar

54
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:22,159
little similar
 

55
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:38,950
little similar
they have the same leaves these

56
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:38,960

 

57
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,710

that's right yeah so basically if you

58
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:40,720
that's right yeah so basically if you
 

59
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,190
that's right yeah so basically if you
want to list all the leaves from left to

60
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:43,200
want to list all the leaves from left to
 

61
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,710
want to list all the leaves from left to
right these two trees are similar so

62
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:46,720
right these two trees are similar so
 

63
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,710
right these two trees are similar so
today's task is very simple given two

64
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:48,720
today's task is very simple given two
 

65
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,749
today's task is very simple given two
trees

66
00:01:49,749 --> 00:01:49,759
trees
 

67
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,710
trees
return true if the leaves from the left

68
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:52,720
return true if the leaves from the left
 

69
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,149
return true if the leaves from the left
to the right

70
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:54,159
to the right
 

71
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,870
to the right
are similar okay so these could have at

72
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:56,880
are similar okay so these could have at
 

73
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,590
are similar okay so these could have at
least eight

74
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:57,600
least eight
 

75
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,990
least eight
and then here seven let's start similar

76
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:00,000
and then here seven let's start similar
 

77
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,350
and then here seven let's start similar
because three four seven

78
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:01,360
because three four seven
 

79
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,910
because three four seven
three four seven does that make sense it

80
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:03,920
three four seven does that make sense it
 

81
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,950
three four seven does that make sense it
doesn't have to be

82
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:04,960
doesn't have to be
 

83
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,710
doesn't have to be
exactly the same notes okay

84
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:08,720
exactly the same notes okay
 

85
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,190
exactly the same notes okay

190
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:50,000
topic okay
 

191
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,510
topic okay
so look we only we only interest in the

192
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:53,520
so look we only we only interest in the
 

193
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,110
so look we only we only interest in the
leave so which is three four seven and

194
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:55,120
leave so which is three four seven and
 

195
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,950
leave so which is three four seven and
we checked here it's three four seven

196
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:56,960
we checked here it's three four seven
 

197
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,670
we checked here it's three four seven
so if it's only the leave we we we push

198
00:04:59,670 --> 00:04:59,680
so if it's only the leave we we we push
 

199
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,950
so if it's only the leave we we we push
it into a list right

200

sorry it's true yeah i know and then

sorry it's true yeah i know and then
 

391
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,829
sorry it's true yeah i know and then
yeah from the left what does it mean

00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:01,839
yeah from the left what does it mean
 

393
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,350
yeah from the left what does it mean
okay then i try

394
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:03,360
okay then i try
 

395
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,590
okay then i try
the left tree and i will keep earring

396
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:05,600
the left tree and i will keep earring
 

397
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,269
the left tree and i will keep earring
right when i found at least

398
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:07,279
right when i found at least
 

399
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,910
right when i found at least
yelling from the right okay but here we

400
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:09,920
yelling from the right okay but here we
 

401
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,870
yelling from the right okay but here we
go

402
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:10,880
go
 

403
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,790
go
we can't directly generate it because

404
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:12,800
we can't directly generate it because
 

405
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,030
we can't directly generate it because
this is a generator not a list

406
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,040
this is a generator not a list
 

407
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,350
this is a generator not a list
yeah so we cannot compare the generator

408
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:17,360
yeah so we cannot compare the generator
 

409
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,630
yeah so we cannot compare the generator
like this because it would

410
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:18,640
like this because it would
 

411
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,949
like this because it would
always return four so instead we will

412
00:11:20,949 --> 00:11:20,959
always return four so instead we will
 

413
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,910
always return four so instead we will
convert a generator into a list

414
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:23,920
convert a generator into a list
 

415
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,269
convert a generator into a list
okay and i know this yeah

416
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:27,279
okay and i know this yeah
 

417
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,590
okay and i know this yeah
so it doesn't is a simplified and you

418
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:29,600
so it doesn't is a simplified and you
 

419
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,389
so it doesn't is a simplified and you
can also

420
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:30,399
can also
 

421
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,790
can also
look you don't need this you don't need

422
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:32,800
look you don't need this you don't need
 

423
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,110
look you don't need this you don't need
this you just do this ear from flat

424
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:35,120
this you just do this ear from flat
 

425
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,710
this you just do this ear from flat
and then you don't need that right here

426
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:36,720
and then you don't need that right here
 

427
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,870
and then you don't need that right here
right then here from

428
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:38,880
right then here from
 

429
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,750
right then here from
that so it's simple yeah if this is the

430
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:41,760
that so it's simple yeah if this is the
 

431
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,670
that so it's simple yeah if this is the
root note i yell the blue the

432
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:43,680
root note i yell the blue the
 

433
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,829
root note i yell the blue the
value yeah then i try to hear the left

434
00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:47,839
value yeah then i try to hear the left
 

435
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,550

recursive

436

recursive
 

437
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,949
recursive
and here the right tree because right

438
00:11:50,949 --> 00:11:50,959
and here the right tree because right
 

439
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,550
and here the right tree because right
does it make sense

440
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:52,560
does it make sense
 

441
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,710
does it make sense
yeah the complexity is still this one

442
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:54,720
yeah the complexity is still this one
 

443
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,150
yeah the complexity is still this one
when comparing this

444

when comparing this
 

445
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,870
when comparing this
so this one is the generator alright so

446
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:58,880
so this one is the generator alright so
 

447
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,870
so this one is the generator alright so
this is a generator it doesn't return

448
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:00,880
this is a generator it doesn't return
 

449
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,829
this is a generator it doesn't return
anything

450
00:12:01,829 --> 00:12:01,839
anything
 

451
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,389
anything
but when you're converting the list then

452
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:04,399
but when you're converting the list then
 

453
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,069
but when you're converting the list then
you will recursively

454
00:12:06,069 --> 00:12:06,079
you will recursively
 

455
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,470
you will recursively
go through the list to get this new

456
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:08,480
go through the list to get this new
 

457
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,389
go through the list to get this new
value right doesn't make sense

then we
 

477
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,750
then we
convert the promise into that

478
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:31,760
convert the promise into that
 

479
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,670
convert the promise into that
100 pounds each day wow
