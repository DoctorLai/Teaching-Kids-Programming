we are going to talk about an
 

7
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,589
we are going to talk about an
interesting mathematics problem

8
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:13,599

 

9
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,189

we call it inverse

10
00:00:17,189 --> 00:00:17,199
we call it inverse
 

11
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,230
we call it inverse
factorial yeah

12
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:20,240
factorial yeah
 

13
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,870
factorial yeah
so can you tell me what is bacteria eric

14
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:22,880
so can you tell me what is bacteria eric
 

15
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,109
so can you tell me what is bacteria eric
i think you understand

16
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:25,119
i think you understand
 

17
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,150
i think you understand
factor yeah okay so okay do you want to

18
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:28,160
factor yeah okay so okay do you want to
 

19
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,060
factor yeah okay so okay do you want to
tell everybody no

20
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:31,070

[Music]

22
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:32,480
[Music]
 

23
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,270
[Music]
i think about factors

24
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:37,280
i think about factors
 

25
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,910
i think about factors
not exactly factorial look remember this

26
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:39,920
not exactly factorial look remember this
 

27
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:40,950
not exactly factorial look remember this
exclamation mark

28
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:40,960
exclamation mark
 

29
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,150
exclamation mark
yeah we extend hmr equals

30
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:44,160
yeah we extend hmr equals
 

31
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,190
yeah we extend hmr equals
equal 120 times 3 we're down okay

32
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:47,200
equal 120 times 3 we're down okay
 

33
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,229
equal 120 times 3 we're down okay
so now this is answer six yes yeah okay

34
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:50,239
so now this is answer six yes yeah okay
 

35
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:51,910
so now this is answer six yes yeah okay
four factorial

36
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:51,920
four factorial
 

37
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,350
four factorial
equals three factorial times four equals

38
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:55,360
equals three factorial times four equals
 

39
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,270
equals three factorial times four equals
24 all right yes okay so now today we're

40
00:00:59,270 --> 00:00:59,280
24 all right yes okay so now today we're
 

41
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,830
24 all right yes okay so now today we're
going to define a function

42
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:01,840
going to define a function
 

43
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,750
going to define a function
def called the inverse

44
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:05,760
def called the inverse
 

45
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,109
def called the inverse
inv factorial okay i'm very hot i want

46
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:09,119

f f what f two
 

75
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,670
f f what f two
which is one f2 which is what

76
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:55,680
which is one f2 which is what
 

77
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,670
which is one f2 which is what
point two right yeah

78
00:01:59,670 --> 00:01:59,680
point two right yeah
 

79
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,069
point two right yeah
okay and f one one f zero

80
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:04,079
okay and f one one f zero
 

81
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,910
okay and f one one f zero
zero nothing right because there's

82
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:07,920
zero nothing right because there's
 

83
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,389
zero nothing right because there's
nothing

84
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:08,399
nothing
 

85
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,350
nothing
minus one if it's not if it's not uh

86
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:11,360
minus one if it's not if it's not uh
 

87
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,309
minus one if it's not if it's not uh
like f7

88
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:12,319
like f7
 

89
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,350
like f7
even less no such number

90
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:15,360
even less no such number
 

91
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,070
even less no such number
factorial is seven then with the ten

92
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:18,080
factorial is seven then with the ten
 

93
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,670
factorial is seven then with the ten
minus one

94
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:19,680
minus one
 

95
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,229
minus one
is that clear yeah so any any sorts

96
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:24,239
is that clear yeah so any any sorts
 

97
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,750
is that clear yeah so any any sorts
how do we do seven yeah no no factorial

98
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:27,760
how do we do seven yeah no no factorial
 

99
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,750
how do we do seven yeah no no factorial
equals to seven right

100
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:29,760
equals to seven right
 

101
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,750
equals to seven right
all right

102
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:33,760

 

103
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,470

there is no factorial equals 7 because

104
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:36,480
there is no factorial equals 7 because
 

105
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,949
there is no factorial equals 7 because
you can't find any factorial

106
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:38,959
you can't find any factorial
 

107
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:44,949
you can't find any factorial
that would be equals to 7 right

108
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:44,959

 

109
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,750

now because because look 3 factorial is

110
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:47,760
now because because look 3 factorial is
 

111
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,229
now because because look 3 factorial is
6

112
00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:48,239
6
 

113
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,589
6
4 bacteria right so there's nothing

114
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:51,599
4 bacteria right so there's nothing
 

115
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,110
4 bacteria right so there's nothing
between right

116
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:53,120
between right
 

117
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,990
between right
all right okay so any thoughts any

118
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:56,000
all right okay so any thoughts any
 

119
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,350
all right okay so any thoughts any
thoughts how do we do that

120
00:02:59,350 --> 00:02:59,360

 

121
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,390

we can try right

122
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:02,400
we can try right
 

123
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,589
we can try right
what i mean is we can try and here

124
00:03:05,589 --> 00:03:05,599
what i mean is we can try and here
 

125
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:10,070
what i mean is we can try and here
we can try this number until

126
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:10,080

 

127
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,270

we can try time it yes until this number

128
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:13,280
we can try time it yes until this number
 

129
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,790
we can try time it yes until this number
is bigger than the n

130
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:14,800
is bigger than the n
 

131
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,350
is bigger than the n
then we can't find it if it's all if

132
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:17,360
then we can't find it if it's all if
 

133
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,710
then we can't find it if it's all if
it's equals to n

134
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:18,720
it's equals to n
 

135
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,710
it's equals to n
we find it right that's the easier way

136
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:20,720
we find it right that's the easier way
 

137
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,910
we find it right that's the easier way
right

138
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:21,920
right
 

139
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,030
right
yeah okay so i'm going to do it let's do

140
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,040
yeah okay so i'm going to do it let's do
 

141
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,110
yeah okay so i'm going to do it let's do
this

142
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:27,120
this
 

143
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,550
this
that okay f

144
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:30,560
that okay f
 

145
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,910
that okay f
f n right

146
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:33,920
f n right
 

147
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,509
f n right
yes we we need to check at the end

148
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:37,519
yes we we need to check at the end
 

149
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,229
yes we we need to check at the end
if if n

150
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:42,239

 

151
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,990

is equals to one

152
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,000
is equals to one
 

153
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,110
is equals to one
do we do we return one right

154
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:49,120
do we do we return one right
 

155
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,309
do we do we return one right
yeah if n

156
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:52,319
yeah if n
 

157
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,670
yeah if n
is smaller than

158
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:55,680

 

159
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,390

one small equal zero or smaller than one

160
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:00,400
one small equal zero or smaller than one
 

161
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,390
one small equal zero or smaller than one
with return minus one because there's no

162
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:02,400
with return minus one because there's no
 

163
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,429
with return minus one because there's no
such number

164
00:04:03,429 --> 00:04:03,439
such number
 

165
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,509
such number
factorial the factorial of this is

166
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:07,519
factorial the factorial of this is
 

167
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,869
factorial the factorial of this is
is smaller than one am right yeah

168
00:04:10,869 --> 00:04:10,879
is smaller than one am right yeah
 

169
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,910
is smaller than one am right yeah
negative numbers they don't the factor

170
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:13,920
negative numbers they don't the factor
 

171
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,270
negative numbers they don't the factor
is always positive

172
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:15,280
is always positive
 

173
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,830
is always positive
right okay so now we can try

174
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:19,840
right okay so now we can try
 

175
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,909
right okay so now we can try
we can try from the two because we know

176
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:21,919
we can try from the two because we know
 

177
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:23,670
we can try from the two because we know
once actually we have handled it

178
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:23,680
once actually we have handled it
 

179
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,189
once actually we have handled it
so now we we try from two i

180
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:27,199
so now we we try from two i
 

181
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,390
so now we we try from two i
and then s will be equals to what

182
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:30,400
and then s will be equals to what
 

183
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,350
and then s will be equals to what
to 1 at the beginning yeah so what what

184
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:33,360
to 1 at the beginning yeah so what what
 

185
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,550
to 1 at the beginning yeah so what what
do we know

186
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:34,560
do we know
 

187
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,629
do we know
why this the factorial

188
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:38,639
why this the factorial
 

189
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,909
why this the factorial
is smaller length

190
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:41,919
is smaller length
 

191
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:45,350
is smaller length
smaller than n what do we do

192
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:45,360
smaller than n what do we do
 

193
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,030
smaller than n what do we do
s times s equals

194
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:49,040
s times s equals
 

195
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,469
s times s equals
s times i right and then we need to i

196
00:04:52,469 --> 00:04:52,479
s times i right and then we need to i
 

197
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:57,749
s times i right and then we need to i
plus equals 1. you get it

198
00:04:57,749 --> 00:04:57,759
plus equals 1. you get it
 

199
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,710
plus equals 1. you get it
do you get it look s equals 1 and then s

200
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:00,720
do you get it look s equals 1 and then s
 

201
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,670
do you get it look s equals 1 and then s
smaller than

202
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:01,680
smaller than
 

203
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,710
smaller than
this number if it is 24 okay if it's n

204
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:04,720
this number if it is 24 okay if it's n
 

205
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,310
this number if it is 24 okay if it's n
is 24

206
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:06,320
is 24
 

207
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,830
is 24
and s is 1 and i is 2 s is 1

208
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:09,840
and s is 1 and i is 2 s is 1
 

209
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,790
and s is 1 and i is 2 s is 1
x equals s times i equals that will

210
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:12,800
x equals s times i equals that will
 

211
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,430
x equals s times i equals that will
become 2

212
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:13,440
become 2
 

213
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,029
become 2
right s is 1 i equals 2 s will become 2

214
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:17,039
right s is 1 i equals 2 s will become 2
 

215
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,390
right s is 1 i equals 2 s will become 2
i will become now

216
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:18,400
i will become now
 

217
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,390
i will become now
what i will become 3 3 right

218
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:22,400
what i will become 3 3 right
 

219
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,550
what i will become 3 3 right
all right is 2 smaller than 24

220
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:26,560
all right is 2 smaller than 24
 

221
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,070
all right is 2 smaller than 24
yeah okay then 2 times

222
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:30,080
yeah okay then 2 times
 

223
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,990
yeah okay then 2 times
3 will become 6 right yeah

224
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:34,000
3 will become 6 right yeah
 

225
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,029
3 will become 6 right yeah
and i plus 1 will become 4

226
00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:37,039
and i plus 1 will become 4
 

227
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,150
and i plus 1 will become 4
is six smaller than twenty-four

228
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:40,160
is six smaller than twenty-four
 

229
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,469
is six smaller than twenty-four
then times four equals twenty-four is

230
00:05:42,469 --> 00:05:42,479
then times four equals twenty-four is
 

231
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,110
then times four equals twenty-four is
twenty-four smaller than twenty-four

232
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:45,120
twenty-four smaller than twenty-four
 

233
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,310
twenty-four smaller than twenty-four
now then what then we can do this

234
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:48,320
now then what then we can do this
 

235
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,270
now then what then we can do this
return because now the i will be 5 right

236
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:53,280
return because now the i will be 5 right
 

237
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,629
return because now the i will be 5 right
plus 5 will be 5 i will be now b5

238
00:05:56,629 --> 00:05:56,639
plus 5 will be 5 i will be now b5
 

239
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,390
plus 5 will be 5 i will be now b5
so but the answer is 4 so we return

240
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:00,400
so but the answer is 4 so we return
 

241
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,870
so but the answer is 4 so we return
i minus 1 if

242
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:04,880
i minus 1 if
 

243
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,230
i minus 1 if
if s we can put it this way if s equals

244
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:08,240
if s we can put it this way if s equals
 

245
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,430
if s we can put it this way if s equals
n right

246
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:11,440
n right
 

247
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,510
n right
s will return minus one

248
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:15,520

 

249
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,029

as minus one so this is the same as

250
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:19,039
as minus one so this is the same as
 

251
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,469
as minus one so this is the same as
if s equals n return i number i minus

252
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:22,479
if s equals n return i number i minus
 

253
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:22,950
if s equals n return i number i minus
one

254
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:22,960
one
 

255
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,629
one
as return minus one am right anyway

256
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:26,639
as return minus one am right anyway
 

257
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,830
as return minus one am right anyway
yes okay that's one way of doing it so

258
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:29,840
yes okay that's one way of doing it so
 

259
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,189
yes okay that's one way of doing it so
do we get it

260
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:31,199
do we get it
 

261
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,469
do we get it
yeah that's a lot but it's but it's okay

262
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:34,479
yeah that's a lot but it's but it's okay
 

263
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:35,510
yeah that's a lot but it's but it's okay
i mean this is just

264
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:35,520
i mean this is just
 

265
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,550
i mean this is just
checking checking and then the

266
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:38,560
checking checking and then the
 

267
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,070
checking checking and then the
the man is here the men's

268
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:42,080
the man is here the men's
 

269
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,350
the man is here the men's
so to get it yeah or we can do the other

270
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:45,360
so to get it yeah or we can do the other
 

271
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:45,749
so to get it yeah or we can do the other
way

272
00:06:45,749 --> 00:06:45,759
way
 

273
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,550
way
i i read right here this is the same and

274
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:48,560
i i read right here this is the same and
 

275
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,950
i i read right here this is the same and
then i write it in different color

276
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:50,960
then i write it in different color
 

277
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,629
then i write it in different color
different colors

278
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:54,639

 

279
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,110

maybe blue maybe blue is

280
00:06:59,110 --> 00:06:59,120
maybe blue maybe blue is
 

281
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,350
maybe blue maybe blue is
no black

282
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:03,360
no black
 

283
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,230
no black
so look we can say this look this is

284
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:06,240
so look we can say this look this is
 

285
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,390
so look we can say this look this is
still let's have i equals two okay

286
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:08,400
still let's have i equals two okay
 

287
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,029
still let's have i equals two okay
this power would be the same okay this

288
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:11,039
this power would be the same okay this
 

289
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,670
this power would be the same okay this
part will be same and y

290
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:13,680
part will be same and y
 

291
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,510
part will be same and y
if n we divide it equals one bigger than

292
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:17,520
if n we divide it equals one bigger than
 

293
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,390
if n we divide it equals one bigger than
one

294
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:18,400
one
 

295
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,550
one
what do we do now we're going to try if

296
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:22,560
what do we do now we're going to try if
 

297
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,990
what do we do now we're going to try if
if n modulus

298
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:26,000
if n modulus
 

299
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,830
if n modulus
i can be divided by i if it's not equal

300
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:29,840
i can be divided by i if it's not equal
 

301
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,390
i can be divided by i if it's not equal
zero

302
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:30,400
zero
 

303
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,189
zero
remember not equal to zero then we

304
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:33,199
remember not equal to zero then we
 

305
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,550
remember not equal to zero then we
return minus one because

306
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:34,560
return minus one because
 

307
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,070
return minus one because
we found out is not a fraction uh

308
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:38,080
we found out is not a fraction uh
 

309
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,950
we found out is not a fraction uh
it's not a factorial then otherwise we

310
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:40,960
it's not a factorial then otherwise we
 

311
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,909
it's not a factorial then otherwise we
can divide it

312
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:41,919
can divide it
 

313
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,950
can divide it
and divide it by i we divided b

314
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:44,960
and divide it by i we divided b
 

315
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,990
and divide it by i we divided b
and then i plus one

316
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:48,000
and then i plus one
 

317
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,670
and then i plus one
and then f return minus then here return

318
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:51,680
and then f return minus then here return
 

319
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,350
and then f return minus then here return
minus l return i minus one okay

320
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:55,360
minus l return i minus one okay
 

321
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,150
minus l return i minus one okay
so how we can check here look we can

322
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:58,160
so how we can check here look we can
 

323
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,670
so how we can check here look we can
check here

324
00:07:59,670 --> 00:07:59,680
check here
 

325
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,029
check here
we can check we can check uh

326
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:03,039
we can check we can check uh
 

327
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,629
we can check we can check uh
24 again we're using the 24

328
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:06,639
24 again we're using the 24
 

329
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,990
24 again we're using the 24
24 is it bigger than one

330
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,000
24 is it bigger than one
 

331
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,350
24 is it bigger than one
yeah if 24 can be divided by 2

332
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:13,360
yeah if 24 can be divided by 2
 

333
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,390
yeah if 24 can be divided by 2
yes yes so i don't execute this

334
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:16,400
yes yes so i don't execute this
 

335
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,430
yes yes so i don't execute this
and 24 divided by 2 now become

336
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:19,440
and 24 divided by 2 now become
 

337
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,469
and 24 divided by 2 now become
12 12 and i will become

338
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:22,479
12 12 and i will become
 

339
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,589
12 12 and i will become
3 all right 2 plus one

340
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:25,599
3 all right 2 plus one
 

341
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,790
3 all right 2 plus one
okay is is twelve bigger than one

342
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:30,800

 

343
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,149

twelve divided by three

344
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:34,159
twelve divided by three
 

345
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,709
twelve divided by three
can be divided okay so i don't return

346
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:36,719
can be divided okay so i don't return
 

347
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:37,589
can be divided okay so i don't return
five minus one

348
00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:37,599
five minus one
 

349
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,389
five minus one
twelve divided by three equals four

350
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:40,399
twelve divided by three equals four
 

351
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,310
twelve divided by three equals four
right

352
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:42,320
right
 

353
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,470
right
and i will become four right all right

354
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:46,480
and i will become four right all right
 

355
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,829
and i will become four right all right
is four bigger than one yeah it's four

356
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:49,839
is four bigger than one yeah it's four
 

357
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,509
is four bigger than one yeah it's four
can be divided by four

358
00:08:51,509 --> 00:08:51,519
can be divided by four
 

359
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,710
can be divided by four
yes four divided by four one and four

360
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:54,720
yes four divided by four one and four
 

361
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,910
yes four divided by four one and four
minus one

362
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:55,920
minus one
 

363
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,070
minus one
five okay so four

364
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:00,080
five okay so four
 

365
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,750
five okay so four
one bigger than one

366
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:03,760

 

367
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,949

what's what's the value of four i five

368
00:09:06,949 --> 00:09:06,959
what's what's the value of four i five
 

369
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,070
what's what's the value of four i five
right so the answer is five minus one

370
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:10,080
right so the answer is five minus one
 

371
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,470
right so the answer is five minus one
four so four it means four factorial

372
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:12,480
four so four it means four factorial
 

373
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,110
four so four it means four factorial
equals

374
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:13,120
equals
 

375
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,949

is better
 

383
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,150
is better
which agreement is better ryan left the

384
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:28,160
which agreement is better ryan left the
 

385
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:28,550
which agreement is better ryan left the
right

386
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:28,560
right
 

387
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,590
right
right one which which which measure is

388
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:31,600
right one which which which measure is
 

389
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,350
right one which which which measure is
better

390
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:35,360

 

391
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,269

the one with black this one is better

392
00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:39,279
the one with black this one is better
 

393
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:39,670
the one with black this one is better
yeah

394
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:39,680
yeah
 

395
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,150
yeah
yeah how about you because it hasn't

396
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:42,160
yeah how about you because it hasn't
 

397
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,350
yeah how about you because it hasn't
been good a lot

398
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:43,360
been good a lot
 

399
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,110
been good a lot
yeah it's shorter right it's shorter

400
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:45,120
yeah it's shorter right it's shorter
 

401
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,949
yeah it's shorter right it's shorter
yeah yeah are you sure

402
00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:46,959
yeah yeah are you sure
 

403
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,190
yeah yeah are you sure
are you sure this is easier to

404
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:49,200
are you sure this is easier to
 

405
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,630
are you sure this is easier to
understand right because if i

406
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:50,640
understand right because if i
 

407
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,230
understand right because if i
24 if i given the number 24

408
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:54,240
24 if i given the number 24
 

409
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,870
24 if i given the number 24
i divide it by two and then i again

410
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:56,880
i divide it by two and then i again
 

411
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,910
i divide it by two and then i again
divide it by three

412
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:57,920
divide it by three
 

413
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,230
divide it by three
and then again i divided four by four

414
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:00,240
and then again i divided four by four
 

415
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,829
and then again i divided four by four
until it reaches one

416
00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:01,839
until it reaches one
 

417
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,790
until it reaches one
right this is easy right like six how do

418
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:04,800
right this is easy right like six how do
 

419
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,350
right this is easy right like six how do
you know if

420
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:05,360
you know if
 

421
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,389
you know if
six is a factorial number divided by

422
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:08,399
six is a factorial number divided by
 

423
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,870
six is a factorial number divided by
two and divided by three and then it's

424
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:10,880
two and divided by three and then it's
 

425
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,910
two and divided by three and then it's
one right

426
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:11,920
one right
 

427
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,710
one right
how do you know seven is no number

428
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:14,720
how do you know seven is no number
 

429
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,110
how do you know seven is no number
because you can't divide by two

430
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:17,120
because you can't divide by two
 

431
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,470
because you can't divide by two
that's right oh maybe i look a is a

432
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:20,480
that's right oh maybe i look a is a
 

433
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,550
that's right oh maybe i look a is a
factor no because a can divided by two

434
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:24,560
factor no because a can divided by two
 

435
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,910
factor no because a can divided by two
but now it's four

436
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:25,920
but now it's four
 

437
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,910
but now it's four
right yeah but four o'clock divided by

438
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:27,920
right yeah but four o'clock divided by
 

439
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,030
right yeah but four o'clock divided by
three right yeah

440
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:29,040
three right yeah
 

441
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,389
three right yeah
okay so you get it right yes so which

442
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:32,399
okay so you get it right yes so which
 

443
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,630
okay so you get it right yes so which
way do you like best

444
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:34,640
way do you like best
 

445
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,110
way do you like best
the black one the black one is easier

446
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:37,120
the black one the black one is easier
 

447
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,190
the black one the black one is easier
yeah but this way this this one is also

448
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:39,200
yeah but this way this this one is also
 

449
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:39,910
yeah but this way this this one is also
okay it's

450
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:39,920
okay it's
 

451
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,389
okay it's
very opposite do you understand this is

452
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:42,399
very opposite do you understand this is
 

453
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,590
very opposite do you understand this is
opposite this is

454
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:43,600
opposite this is
 

455
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,509
opposite this is
you divide it but this one is times a

456
00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:45,519
you divide it but this one is times a
 

457
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,110
you divide it but this one is times a
you i have to try

458
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:47,120
you i have to try
 

459
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,150
you i have to try
okay for this one for this example okay

460
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:50,160
okay for this one for this example okay
 

461
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,069
okay for this one for this example okay
how do we know if a is not a factorial

462
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:52,079
how do we know if a is not a factorial
 

463
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,829
how do we know if a is not a factorial
number one times two

464
00:10:53,829 --> 00:10:53,839
number one times two
 

465
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,870
number one times two
two two times three smaller six smaller

466
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:56,880
two two times three smaller six smaller
 

467
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,590
two two times three smaller six smaller
than a

468
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:57,600
than a
 

469
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,310
than a
and times four twelve is bigger than a

470
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:00,320
and times four twelve is bigger than a
 

471
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,430
and times four twelve is bigger than a
so it's not a

472
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:01,440
so it's not a
 

473
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,790
so it's not a
fracture okay you get it

474
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:04,800
fracture okay you get it
 

475
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,670
fracture okay you get it
okay how about 25 is this the second

476
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:07,680
okay how about 25 is this the second
 

477
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,269
okay how about 25 is this the second
number

478
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:09,279
number
 

479

483
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,350
6 times four 24 24 times five
or 120 right if one is bigger than this

484
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:19,360
or 120 right if one is bigger than this
 

485
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,870
or 120 right if one is bigger than this
number it can't be a factor
