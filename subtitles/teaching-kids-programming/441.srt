1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,439
go

2
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:05,839
hello mr miss ryan are you right

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:08,320
we talked about the largest uh sublisten

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:10,800
yeah largest

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,800
sadly

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,480
service

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,520
sometimes we call it sub-array okay

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,880
what's so funny nothing

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,000
what's the difference between service

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,119
sub-array or and subject

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,119
what

12
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,039
it's continuous what do you try is

13
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,960
continuous

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,760
these two are continuous okay for

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,079
example like let's let's do this one two

16
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,640
three this is an array so can you give

17
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:41,280
me a example of a service

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,559
three two one no

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,800
two one

20
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,960
three three what is it

21
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,960
one two three okay two three one so

22
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,039
these have to be three

23
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,760
two three one is not two three one this

24
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,239
one

25
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,800
so let's continue

26
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,680
yeah continuous one two three one two

27
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:03,440
one two three four five

28
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,239
and twelve fourteen fifteen sixty seven

29
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:09,320
one

30
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,320
eighteen twenty twenty one zero

31
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:14,299
[Music]

32
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:19,360
can you give me an example of

33
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,960
subsequence uh one

34
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,960
uh

35
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,400
one six nine eight two one three four

36
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,400
three seven one three one three okay

37
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,200
not continuous yeah not continuous one

38
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,439
two three four eight nine six

39
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,040
and all of the others only alice what do

40
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,240
you mean because

41
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,439
sex don't have to be uh

42
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,840
you know

43
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,479
subsequent don't have to be continuous

44
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,720
yeah that's right so lee all these

45
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,280
are subsequent right

46
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,680
am i right yeah service

47
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,880
yeah okay so stop this

48
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,240
service

49
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,520
is part of a subsequent yeah this is

50
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,759
kind of in

51
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,680
that means in okay

52
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,520
subsequent

53
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,479
so if we draw a set

54
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,040
here

55
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,959
that will be sublist

56
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,280
and then here will be subsequent okay

57
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,319
because subsequence includes the sunless

58
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,120
okay

59
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,160
okay let's see that's it no more

60
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,360
yeah

61
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,680
so for for problems like sublist we can

62
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:25,040
always do

63
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,360
we can do what uh we can b false false

64
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,080
and that's going to take roughly oh

65
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,879
what's the time complex

66
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,280
o n squared

67
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,560
why is that look we because we we can

68
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,160
pick

69
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,239
we can pick one

70
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,599
uh the particular style of the sub list

71
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,680
and then we can pick the end of the

72
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,959
sunday right so that would be like a

73
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,200
nasty for

74
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,800
loop and that's going to take owen

75
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,280
square time okay

76
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,760
if it's a subsequence right because if

77
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,519
it's a subsequent the time context if we

78
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,519
prove us it you'll be out to the power

79
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,440
of n yeah because for each element we

80
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,000
can pick or not pick right

81
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,640
yeah yeah so 2 times 2 times 2 times 2

82
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,159
that's 2 to the power okay so so usually

83
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:10,640
subsequence is uh is the problem is more

84
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,640
uh complicated than the

85
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,959
sub array okay

86
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,560
so for this kind of problem proof us we

87
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,319
can do this uh we can do it in

88
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:23,840
performance okay let's quickly improve

89
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:26,640
okay i think i'm running out of ink

90
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:32,799
you can use my pen

91
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:34,159
defined last is the sadly some okay

92
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,959
okay

93
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,879
so we just have to proof of the left and

94
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,879
right index right the left and right

95
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,879
index

96
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,840
first of all first of all the answer

97
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,040
is minus

98
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:58,840
the mass infinity

99
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,720
and then n will be the length of the

100
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,680
numbers

101
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,560
four

102
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,680
i

103
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,280
in range

104
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,480
and right

105
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,280
for

106
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,319
j

107
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,959
e

108
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:15,200
range we start from the i the next

109
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,799
boundary is the left boundary j is the

110
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,359
right boundary

111
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:21,359
and then the current sum will be

112
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,150
sum

113
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:23,840
numbers

114
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:26,800
[Music]

115
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,880
start from i to j plus one yeah because

116
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,919
up to j plus one

117
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:36,800
and then answer plus one answer equals

118
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:39,440
what maximum of answer uh and the sum x

119
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:43,840
310 answer

120
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,840
what's the time complexity this one

121
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,959
[Music]

122
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,639
because this is one time right but we

123
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,479
can easily optimize this this is o n

124
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,639
square o and q b sorry

125
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:01,120
but we can optimize it because this is

126
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,600
every time for each sub array we we

127
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,840
don't need to calculate the sum right we

128
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,800
don't need to calculate the sum okay

129
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:11,039
so how do we do that we just have to

130
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,960
how do we optimize this into our own

131
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,840
square

132
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,160
we make it quicker look we just put the

133
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,199
sum here s equals zero

134
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,919
right

135
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,479
so instead of summing because this takes

136
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:28,720
time let's take some right let's take

137
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:30,000
some but we we just do this s plus equal

138
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,440
nums

139
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,680
j

140
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,600
and i know b right look

141
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,280
here in this case this is

142
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,440
o n square right

143
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,199
do you see how we do it yeah this is

144
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,520
slow why is that because every time we

145
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:46,960
have to calculate

146
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:50,840
the subtly sum again and again

147
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:53,680
actually why is that look one two three

148
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:56,000
four we know this summary sum is six

149
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,880
right yeah yeah

150
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,199
yeah

151
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,199
okay what's the subtle sum this way

152
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,800
yeah

153
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,639
this is i told you here this is six

154
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,840
if i include one more number what's the

155
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,319
third sum

156
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:15,600
so this one is ten exactly how do you

157
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:18,240
get the ten uh six plus four is ten

158
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,880
exactly here right but previously this

159
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,280
one it does not do it the previously you

160
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:26,000
will just do it very stupid one plus two

161
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,400
plus three plus two that's stupid that's

162
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,720
how it's very slow okay but we are now

163
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,960
changing it because we already know this

164
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,479
okay okay we are now knowing this is

165
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,960
streets

166
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:39,840
plus another one

167
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,120
accumulated it's just well done

168
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,319
okay so

169
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,880
katan

170
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,840
yeah we also know the katan right what's

171
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,720
katan

172
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,720
kaidan is

173
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,509
[Music]

174
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,759
so look one two three minus four minus

175
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,639
five something like that okay so let's

176
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,280
say

177
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,039
the kazan is like the iterated dynamic

178
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,199
programming and we talk about it so if

179
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:16,720
we're saying dp

180
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:19,440
dpi this is the maximum surface sum that

181
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,880
ends at index i right so it's actually

182
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,280
equal to

183
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,720
maximum of come on come on can you can

184
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,680
you calm down all right people not

185
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,720
seeing it

186
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,880
dp i minus 1

187
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,280
or zero plus

188
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,880
nums i okay so this is the basically a

189
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,680
dynamic problem what does it mean is

190
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,599
that dpi oh listen to me

191
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:43,280
it's the largest subject sum that ends

192
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,960
the index i right so it equals to

193
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,039
the previous one

194
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,800
right if we pick the previous one oh we

195
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:51,840
don't pick it we start is the least

196
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,759
number okay ryan come on

197
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:57,520
so look

198
00:07:53,759 --> 00:08:00,479
look you are here i am cp vp we are here

199
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,319
dpi so we are considering this number so

200
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,080
this is

201
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,160
we are considering this number so there

202
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,479
are basically two choice all right so if

203
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:11,599
we include this number in the pre in the

204
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:13,680
it is uh previous previous sub

205
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,520
right so you will have one more right oh

206
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,919
we don't include the previous number so

207
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,319
we started as a new list so let's let's

208
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,240
sub this star is here basically there

209
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,840
are two choice that's what it means

210
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,199
right that's what it means

211
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,039
so

212
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,199
we can do this

213
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,400
let me just write it right

214
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:34,159
define

215
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:37,200
largest sublet sum lss

216
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,200
numbers okay

217
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,039
okay so if not numbers we can just put

218
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,279
it if not numbers we just return zero

219
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,279
okay

220
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:52,080
and that is we got one number so answer

221
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:54,320
equals the curve equals num zero so we

222
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:58,160
start with putting single number then we

223
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,680
start from the second number for i in

224
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,880
nums

225
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:06,880
start from one one to the end

226
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:09,040
so current equals the maximum of current

227
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,200
plus i or

228
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:14,080
i okay so this is basically saying that

229
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,720
okay let's try two possibilities one is

230
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:19,680
to include this number in the in the

231
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,279
largest submission or

232
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,360
we start this

233
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,279
start a new list with a single number

234
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,880
current number okay and then answer

235
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,480
equals

236
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,920
maximum

237
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,839
answer

238
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,240
sum okay

239
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,240
count

240
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,279
we can return one

241
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,720
also yeah

242
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,040
what's the tank on backstage if you look

243
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,040
at this

244
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:50,680
okay answer because maximum okay

245
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,680
make sense

246
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,680
yeah

247
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,560
okay so now come on today's problem

248
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:02,640
today's problem yeah today's problem is

249
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,640
look one slightly different

250
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,800
is we want to find out this continuous

251
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,279
continuous sub array which is the

252
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,600
absolute value abs

253
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,120
so nums

254
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,839
i

255
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,720
plus

256
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:22,480
num i plus one etcetera okay so we can

257
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,480
we want to find out a sub this

258
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,399
continuous surface which has the

259
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,800
absolute which is this what is this

260
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,320
absolute value why is this absolute

261
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,640
value

262
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,200
what is this absolute value

263
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,200
what's this

264
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:42,880
what does it mean

265
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:46,000
abs minus 10 what's what is it equal

266
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:49,040
it means

267
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,120
oh is it a 10 10 the distance to the

268
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,800
deal right basically so the minus will

269
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,399
be

270
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,680
the

271
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,399
negative

272
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,880
the negative value will be at least

273
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,880
taken out

274
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,920
so this is the only difference we want

275
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:20,240
to find out the absolute value so

276
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,920
so obviously we can

277
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,480
use the first two approach yeah the

278
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:27,440
proof was o and cubic or in cubic

279
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,040
exactly o n square yeah i'm gonna i'm

280
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,360
not going to write it's basically

281
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,680
similar we just have to write put one

282
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,440
more absolute value right but how can we

283
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,320
apply this kadam

284
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,079
or dynamic programming approach to to

285
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,360
this kind of problem right with this

286
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:45,920
absolute v1 with this as a blue killer

287
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,000
what's this absolute key word actually

288
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,760
so you will make the you you'll be

289
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,440
you'll be actually the distance to the

290
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,360
zero right right

291
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,480
so the only two possibilities either you

292
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,880
go very very far to the right or you go

293
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,519
very very far to the left right

294
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,760
so in this case we can use two values

295
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,519
one is to store the maximum

296
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,639
maximum sum

297
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,320
of the

298
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,279
of the subways we have seen so far and

299
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,800
the other one we see is what we find the

300
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,880
minimum

301
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,680
sum of the subjects we have seen so far

302
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,519
right yeah so how can we apply this this

303
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,000
is quite interesting look so we just

304
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:24,399
have to do this right current we just

305
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,839
have to put this color into the laser

306
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,160
low

307
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,560
and then equals and then also equals the

308
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,440
max and the height

309
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,600
okay

310
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,240
yeah

311
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,120
then this is the same we do this the

312
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,639
high

313
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:43,760
equals maximum curve high plus

314
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,279
i and we add one more low equals the

315
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,760
minimum

316
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:51,600
low plus i i

317
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:55,040
then answer equals maximum answer

318
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:58,240
okay so there are two more values high

319
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:00,800
or minus low right okay and then return

320
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,760
answer this is only changes right come

321
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,920
on this is the takeaway of today

322
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,720
this is the new thing today

323
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:10,800
do you get this problem

324
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,040
we are adding this absolutely absolute

325
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,360
value is basically the distance to zero

326
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,920
right and we are finding this absolute

327
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,399
value so it could be only two choice

328
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:23,040
either you go very very far to the right

329
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:25,600
which is to the to the east yeah

330
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,120
yeah or you go very very far to the left

331
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,079
which is to the

332
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,200
west

333
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,600
yeah

334
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,200
all right east

335
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,880
west

336
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,519
north

337
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,800
south south okay so we basically

338
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,399
two choice

339
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,959
we can get

340
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:45,600
we can track the

341
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:48,800
largest value that going east or we can

342
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:51,120
check the largest value going west right

343
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,959
so instead of checking the one single

344
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,480
value we have this low and maybe we just

345
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,680
change it to

346
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,320
to

347
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,920
east and west okay east and west

348
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,360
so

349
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:05,680
east with maximum easter plus i

350
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,920
the west will be minimum right because

351
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:11,040
what going west going left will be the

352
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:13,360
minimum so we're going to minimum plus i

353
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,360
and then

354
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:19,519
going east or minus going west so this

355
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,600
is the same thing as taking the absolute

356
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,079
value yeah because we know the west will

357
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,959
be the negative number so we just do

358
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:29,680
this minus w so so

359
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:32,800
this is basically the same as like we

360
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:36,000
are applying we are applying the kadan

361
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:38,240
uh agreement twice on this program okay

362
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,399
yes what's the time complexity for this

363
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,720
one come on

364
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:46,000
oh n right yeah because we just

365
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:48,480
we iterating ones of the array and we

366
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,240
are taking tracking the maximum minimum

367
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,839
value okay yeah

368
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:55,480
yeah what have you learned today so far

369
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,480
come on one sentence

370
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,809
[Music]

371
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,279
yeah absolutely the largest surplus

372
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,800
largest

373
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:17,519
services okay so today we we we are just

374
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:20,240
adding a keyword abs here absolute

375
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:23,120
service sound okay and then how do we do

376
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,279
it we're just applying the kadan

377
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,440
twice kadai is basically like iterated

378
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,360
dynamic programming yeah so let me talk

379
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,639
to me so it's uh let me just write it

380
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,440
again one more time okay right here so

381
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:35,839
dpi

382
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,560
is let's let's

383
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,610
what's dpi

384
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,610
[Music]

385
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,519
numbers i okay

386
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:47,600
let me explain this one more time so

387
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:50,240
this is the key key takeaway of the

388
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:53,360
dynamic programming dpi is the largest

389
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:56,639
surface on the ends the index side

390
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,720
so we are looking at this number so

391
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,040
the largest sub is sum we can include we

392
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,959
can try to include this number in the

393
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,199
previous of the sum right

394
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:07,519
and plus it or we don't pick the

395
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:11,759
previous one then we start with kinds of

396
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,759
numbers so look one two

397
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,720
minus four five okay so if we are

398
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,320
looking at this number so

399
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,639
there are two choice

400
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,560
we can increase minus four

401
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,839
in the previous subtly sum yeah

402
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,199
previously sum is bpi minus one here

403
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,959
so i don't know

404
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,160
i don't know uh

405
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,240
which one is

406
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:35,440
maximum right which one is higher so

407
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:38,240
basically dpi minus one dbi minus one

408
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,560
come on it's the service sum of the

409
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,560
previous here yeah

410
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,199
i can include this number

411
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:47,279
right so you the previous sub list will

412
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:50,240
include one more minus one

413
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:52,160
or i decide i can drop it so i start a

414
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,240
new list from here right

415
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,720
yeah do you get it

416
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,440
do you get it right this is basically it

417
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,519
okay and then plug yellow means that we

418
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,360
we are dropping the previous sum right

419
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,720
and then we we start with a new one

420
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,240
right

421
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:12,120
okay that's it for today bye bye bye

422
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,120
bye bye
