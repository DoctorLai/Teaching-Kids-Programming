1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,319
uh hello mr mr rhino right

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:07,600
[Music]

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:09,280
what have we talked about yesterday

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,040
we are talking about the deficits the

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,799
yesterday and the day before is today

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,080
yeah on the first on the day before

7
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:15,200
yesterday we talked about these the

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,759
recursive

9
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,759
deficits

10
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,400
exactly yesterday we talked about the

11
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,320
iterated uh deficit

12
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,119
we're using a stack right we use instead

13
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,279
we do this in order so the idea is that

14
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,679
we use the stack we push

15
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:34,079
push the note and go to the left go to

16
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,079
the left as much as we can right and

17
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,079
then we take one out from the stack and

18
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,879
we go to the right so that will result

19
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,719
in the in order so the problem is that

20
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,280
we're given two trees yeah one is

21
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,960
another one's clone and we given the

22
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,480
note in the one tree and we want to find

23
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,239
the corresponding one and then for

24
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,239
example like

25
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,239
this is a 3a

26
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:57,199
and then that's the exactly the same

27
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,039
copy of the 3a but it's a clone right

28
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:02,239
this is 3p so if we are given these

29
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,239
three this node a node in three a we

30
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:07,040
want to find a corresponding one in

31
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,119
three b we just synchronize we have two

32
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,840
we have two pointers so we synchronize

33
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:14,560
well we go to the left yeah we go down

34
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,000
we go down for example if we have a more

35
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,920
note here yeah

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,600
smaller note

37
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,360
okay so these two three is the same yeah

38
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,439
so how exactly are we doing this look

39
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,600
different search either is not recursion

40
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:28,720
or iterative right so one

41
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,240
two

42
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,479
four look look at my couple's fingers

43
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,840
they have the same movement right

44
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,560
yeah

45
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,240
yeah okay so because for example this is

46
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,119
the node we are looking for and then we

47
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,360
return

48
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,680
with within three so yeah you got it so

49
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:49,600
the default search what's the order one

50
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,119
two four five six three but for the

51
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,000
processes

52
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,399
one

53
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,280
two three four

54
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,880
five six okay so for example six is the

55
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,119
note we are looking for

56
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,360
now what should we do we return the one

57
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,600
on the right hand okay yeah okay make

58
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,759
sense

59
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,160
let's just quickly review what's my

60
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,160
favorite

61
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,800
what's breakfast don't say it's a

62
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,840
breakfast okay breast first

63
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,879
it's when you breathe

64
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,120
breath what's breath

65
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,120
is

66
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,239
okay so what's this word breath

67
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,959
it's supposed to

68
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,800
read

69
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,040
what's breath

70
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,040
why

71
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,720
how do you spell west

72
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,720
this is breath yeah breathe yeah but we

73
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,360
are talking about the breath

74
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,400
so breakfast so basically look we have a

75
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,319
tree we want to go

76
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:05,040
horizontally right horizontally so let's

77
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:07,120
dress as opposed to death we want to go

78
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,959
deep as much as we can right it's just

79
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,280
two different ways of traversing the

80
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,560
tree also the grass right but

81
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:17,319
okay so

82
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,319
how do we implement the preferences bffs

83
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
q yeah dq yeah

84
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:26,400
look i killed q equals cq f q dq

85
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,319
double ndq yeah

86
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,040
at the beginning we can put the rules in

87
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,519
right

88
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,560
which is number one right okay so now

89
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,640
this is the cube at the beginning

90
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,000
we put a one in that's in inside okay so

91
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,120
what do we do

92
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,440
we take

93
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,080
like the two ways we can take everything

94
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,480
out or we can take one note out we both

95
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,560
are okay yeah so for example if we want

96
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,480
to take one note off we take

97
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,200
one note of first thing first off let's

98
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,560
cue

99
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,640
what's what's the kit of one

100
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,360
two one three two and three another a

101
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,519
pen i push it to the to the cube okay

102
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,120
now okay i can take everything out or i

103
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,439
can take one note out what's the what's

104
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,840
the next next note to come out from the

105
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:10,480
queue here what's the key this is the

106
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,439
two yes because first in first order so

107
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:16,400
it comes this way this is in q we put a

108
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:18,479
note in here oh and this one is dq means

109
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,639
to take it right now so we take two

110
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,880
hours what's the kit

111
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,400
okay and i push it four and then five

112
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,040
okay and then what's the next note to

113
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,759
come out from the queue three okay

114
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,320
what's the number what's the kilometer

115
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,320
six and seven you got it and then we

116
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,759
just take a four out it doesn't have any

117
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,520
kid take the fire out you guys don't

118
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,880
have any kid take a six out it doesn't

119
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,199
have a drink

120
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,440
yeah so that's the order of the birthday

121
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:46,080
okay yeah

122
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,880
i was just taking one note at a time we

123
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,400
can also take a and take all the notes

124
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,840
so what's the difference you tell me

125
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,520
okay so look

126
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,600
no one in that

127
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,360
yeah no one in there i take everything

128
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,120
out which you want and what's the kid

129
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,360
that's a two or three okay

130
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,759
i will i was taking two at the time now

131
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,680
i can take if i take two and three oh

132
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,680
what's the kiss of two and three you

133
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,600
know that four five six seven

134
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,120
okay so you see the difference do you

135
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,280
see the difference

136
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,360
if i take everything out i can be

137
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,360
assured that all the nodes at any time

138
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,560
in the queue belongs to the same level

139
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,720
am i right

140
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,039
yeah we've given this to three a and b

141
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,520
and how do we use the preferences to

142
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:30,320
solve this problem to solve this problem

143
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,320
this is 3a this is 3p so 3a

144
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,240
is like this

145
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:44,080
so look three should be exactly copy so

146
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,199
every time i we have a q we push the

147
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,199
copper

148
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,120
of a and b right

149
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,479
and then we push the top off

150
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,639
of a and b

151
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,720
and we just check if the note equals to

152
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,000
the to the uh

153
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,720
to the three a

154
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,520
then we return the second parameter uh

155
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,120
in the top which is the three b okay q

156
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,039
defined

157
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,600
by first search

158
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:10,000
a b pocket okay

159
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,639
q equals c q

160
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,479
at the beginning we push the dude which

161
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,680
we lose one a and b yeah so

162
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,479
so what

163
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,560
a

164
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,560
b

165
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,600
that's right oh yeah immutable can

166
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:32,000
change so look this title has two

167
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,160
elements the first first element of

168
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,919
pepper is the note from a tree a the

169
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,919
second parameter is the corresponding

170
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,800
node in the tree b okay and then now

171
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,199
look

172
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,479
y up q right

173
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:46,639
so we can get the dense length q

174
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:50,880
and then we take everything out of the q

175
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:53,039
queue dq in range n

176
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,800
okay and then look x

177
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:58,080
y equals q dot top left okay we take

178
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,479
these

179
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:04,160
we take a note out of a queue first

180
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:05,680
inverse or the top left okay

181
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,120
if

182
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,880
x equal

183
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,720
if x is t

184
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:15,120
right if x is t we talk about this is

185
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,360
and the double equal sign right right

186
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,120
yes so we so what's the difference

187
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,280
between if i use the e and what's the

188
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,440
difference if i use the a so for example

189
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,960
a equal equal b what's the difference a

190
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,960
is b

191
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,319
what's the difference a

192
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,560
is b

193
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,000
which one is the value check that we

194
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,560
check the value which way is check the

195
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,560
identity

196
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:40,000
i think the value is equal equal yes and

197
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:43,360
this one is identity okay so basically

198
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,639
this one identity is id a equal equal

199
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,639
idp okay this is the equivalent okay a

200
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,560
equal equal b is the value check for

201
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,000
example like

202
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,199
a equals

203
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,080
one two

204
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:58,319
b equals one two these are two different

205
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,599
array but they have a same content their

206
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,199
values are the same so a equal equal b

207
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:05,360
is true a is b

208
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:09,840
false because if they are different

209
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:13,840
right but if a equals one two and if b

210
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:16,639
equals a then a equal to b true a is b

211
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:20,160
is it true of us yeah yes because b

212
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:23,199
equals a b is an alias it's the same as

213
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:26,240
a it's just different name okay so e

214
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:28,800
so if x was t then t is the note in a

215
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:32,080
that would be 10 y right look because x

216
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,080
and y are the corresponding note right x

217
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,039
is the note in the tree a why is the

218
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,200
tree not in the tree b if if x is no we

219
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,039
are looking for then we return the

220
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,279
corresponding one which is y okay and

221
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,640
then we just have to do this if x dot

222
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,720
left

223
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,720
then we just return oh we just push the

224
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,360
key yeah kill the append

225
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,360
up and x

226
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,680
tapper yeah extra left right or left and

227
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,200
can you tell me what's missing here

228
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,600
is what

229
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,320
look we're checking the left tree if we

230
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,440
lay electric which push the left tree

231
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:08,320
into the cube yeah if x to the right

232
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,360
q dot append extra right white or white

233
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,200
right

234
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,480
if extra white

235
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,399
q dot append x dot right y the right

236
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,080
okay that's a couple

237
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,240
time complexly

238
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,020
if there are n notes what's the tangent

239
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,800
let's be

240
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:27,360
[Music]

241
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,560
so because each node we visit once

242
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,800
correct

243
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,320
so let's open right what's the space

244
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,160
complexity

245
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,320
um

246
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,760
yeah why is that

247
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,680
we're using and

248
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,560
space to store the notes what have you

249
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,240
learned today we're learning about

250
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,600
breakfast

251
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,120
yeah we talked about two trees yeah

252
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,920
and

253
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,120
they're basically the same thing yeah

254
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,399
and then

255
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,399
the problem is

256
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,160
there's two trees that they're saying

257
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,880
number one that's in the other one yeah

258
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,279
yeah yeah the professor okay so okay so

259
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,079
to sum up we are given two binary trees

260
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:11,440
yeah

261
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:15,040
a and b b is a clone of three a

262
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,800
and if we are given a note in three a we

263
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,200
we want to find the corresponding note

264
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,440
in a tree b all right remember what

265
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,680
what's this look two hands

266
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,480
yeah let's just search one

267
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,399
two

268
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:30,000
five three four okay four is the note we

269
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,959
we are looking for and then we return

270
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,720
this one right and 10 massages where one

271
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,600
two three

272
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,279
four

273
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,200
five okay five is the note we are

274
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,600
looking for then we return the right

275
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:45,640
hand okay okay make sense

276
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,640
yeah that's it for today bye

277
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,600
you
