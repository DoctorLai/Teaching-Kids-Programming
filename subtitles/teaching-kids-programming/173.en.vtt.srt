00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:06,399
hello mr ryan how are you today good
 

5
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:09,430
hello mr ryan how are you today good
i'm good good so yesterday we talked

6
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:09,440
i'm good good so yesterday we talked
 

7
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:09,990
i'm good good so yesterday we talked
about

8
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:10,000
about
 

9
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,110
about
some binary tree

10
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:13,120
some binary tree
 

11
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,550
some binary tree
some binary tree

12
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:16,560
some binary tree
 

13
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,630
some binary tree
so i'm going to draw a binary tree and

14
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:18,640
so i'm going to draw a binary tree and
 

15
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,310
so i'm going to draw a binary tree and
tell me if it's a sun balancer or not

16
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:20,320
tell me if it's a sun balancer or not
 

17
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,109
tell me if it's a sun balancer or not
okay

18
00:00:21,109 --> 00:00:21,119
okay
 

19
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:26,390
okay
what is the sun binary tree

20
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:26,400

 

21
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:40,470

why is it no oh

22
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:40,480

 

23
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,190

so the parent needs to be equal to its

24
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:43,200
so the parent needs to be equal to its
 

25
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:43,990
so the parent needs to be equal to its
two kids

26
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:44,000
two kids
 

27
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,150
two kids
right two plus one plus five three

28
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:46,160
right two plus one plus five three
 

29
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,830
right two plus one plus five three
equals three

30
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:47,840
equals three
 

31
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,470
equals three
three yeah three equals three but not

32
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:50,480
three yeah three equals three but not
 

33
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:50,950
three yeah three equals three but not
except

34
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:50,960
except
 

35
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,029
except
the least no this note does not have any

36
00:00:53,029 --> 00:00:53,039
the least no this note does not have any
 

37
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,029
the least no this note does not have any
kids so that's why this is

38
00:00:55,029 --> 00:00:55,039
kids so that's why this is
 

39
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,910
kids so that's why this is
some binary tree okay got it right look

40
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:57,920
some binary tree okay got it right look
 

41
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,430
some binary tree okay got it right look
there you go on my hand

42
00:00:59,430 --> 00:00:59,440
there you go on my hand
 

43
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,549
there you go on my hand
that's okay look at my new tattoo okay

check the notes when we're visiting the
 

89
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,309
check the notes when we're visiting the
node yeah to check if it's the sum of

want to
 

117
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,990
want to
do x any variable too so x

118
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:54,000
do x any variable too so x
 

119
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,710
do x any variable too so x
equals zero and then let's keep the

120
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:56,720
equals zero and then let's keep the
 

121
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,509
equals zero and then let's keep the
result here

122
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:57,519

if there are any violations
then we set it to fourth right if

128
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:05,280
then we set it to fourth right if
 

129
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,550
then we set it to fourth right if
if less the left note oh wait

yeah and then yeah sorry
 

145
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,750
yeah and then yeah sorry
so x is the x is the stores the number

146
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:43,760
so x is the x is the stores the number
 

147
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,550
so x is the x is the stores the number
the sum right yeah so if there are left

148
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:46,560
the sum right yeah so if there are left
 

149
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,430
the sum right yeah so if there are left
keys or x

150
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:47,440
keys or x
 

151
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,550
keys or x
needs to plus equals one i'll be

152
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:50,560
needs to plus equals one i'll be
 

153
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,589
needs to plus equals one i'll be
uh x that's equal root

154
00:03:53,589 --> 00:03:53,599
uh x that's equal root
 

155
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,509
uh x that's equal root
right x equal root what

156
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:57,519
right x equal root what
 

157
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:05,270
right x equal root what
we don't like the left

158
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:05,280

 

159
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,350

and then we want to because we check the

160
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:07,360
and then we want to because we check the
 

161
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,949
and then we want to because we check the
left tree right

162
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:08,959
left tree right
 

163
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:17,220
left tree right
yeah so answer equals

164
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:17,230

oh okay so answer equals the answer of
 

171
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,670
oh okay so answer equals the answer of
death side okay say the definition of

172
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:37,680
death side okay say the definition of
 

173
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,150
death side okay say the definition of
the

174
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:38,160
the
 

175
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,990
the
reader of the left uh left children

176
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,000
reader of the left uh left children
 

177
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,390
reader of the left uh left children
so what does it mean what are we doing

178
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:44,400
so what does it mean what are we doing
 

179
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,670
so what does it mean what are we doing
what's this function

180
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:45,680
what's this function
 

181
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,390
what's this function
what what's this function do oh it's

182
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:48,400
what what's this function do oh it's
 

183
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:48,790
what what's this function do oh it's
it's

184
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:48,800
it's
 

185
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,830
it's
like this one is going and checking

186
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:51,840
like this one is going and checking
 

187
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,710
like this one is going and checking
on the left children so what's what are

188
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:54,720
on the left children so what's what are
 

189
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,469
on the left children so what's what are
we doing here what's this

190
00:04:56,469 --> 00:04:56,479
we doing here what's this
 

191
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,870
we doing here what's this
search what's what's this doing what

192
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:58,880
search what's what's this doing what
 

193
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,469
search what's what's this doing what
what does it return

194
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:00,479
what does it return
 

195
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,909
what does it return
oh it returns if it says some binary

196
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:03,919
oh it returns if it says some binary
 

197
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:04,310
oh it returns if it says some binary
tree

198
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:04,320
tree
 

199
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,390
tree
okay what does it mean

200
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:08,400
okay what does it mean
 

201
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,710
okay what does it mean
oh uh you add up the left

202
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:12,720
oh uh you add up the left
 

203
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,749
oh uh you add up the left
right end of the left here look at the

204
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:15,759
right end of the left here look at the
 

205
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,110
right end of the left here look at the
left side

206
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:17,120
left side
 

207
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,029
left side
we want to check the boot if it's a

208
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:19,039
we want to check the boot if it's a
 

209
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,189
we want to check the boot if it's a
binary some binary right

210
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:21,199
binary some binary right
 

211
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:37,350
binary some binary right
and therefore search what

212
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:37,360

 

213
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,629

root therefore search

214
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:40,639
root therefore search
 

215
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,950
root therefore search
is the function to check if a given

216
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:42,960
is the function to check if a given
 

217
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,070
is the function to check if a given
binary

218
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:44,080
binary
 

219
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,950
binary
is a sum binary we are given root so

220
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:46,960
is a sum binary we are given root so
 

221
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,270
is a sum binary we are given root so
load

222
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:47,280
load
 

223
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,350
load
is here so we want to check the loop

224
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:49,360
is here so we want to check the loop
 

225
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,310
is here so we want to check the loop
this three is

226
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:50,320
this three is
 

227
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,510
this three is
the barrier tree now i'm passing it

228
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:53,520
the barrier tree now i'm passing it
 

229
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,230
the barrier tree now i'm passing it
a little left i'm only passing this bit

230
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:56,240
a little left i'm only passing this bit
 

231
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,749
a little left i'm only passing this bit
so what does it mean

232
00:05:57,749 --> 00:05:57,759
so what does it mean
 

233
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,550
so what does it mean
we're checking the left we want to check

234
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:00,560
we're checking the left we want to check
 

235
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,790
we're checking the left we want to check
the left one

236
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:02,800
the left one
 

237
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,950
the left one
if if the left is what smaller

238
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:06,960
if if the left is what smaller
 

239
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,990
if if the left is what smaller
what left is uh it's

240
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:10,000
what left is uh it's
 

241
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,790
what left is uh it's
left it's smaller than the right it's a

242
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:12,800
left it's smaller than the right it's a
 

243
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,350
left it's smaller than the right it's a
sunburn

244
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:13,360
sunburn
 

245
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,390
sunburn
so come on yeah i got it

246
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:16,400
so come on yeah i got it
 

247
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,110
so come on yeah i got it
you got it now right why is that because

248
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:19,120
you got it now right why is that because
 

249
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,629
you got it now right why is that because
this is recursion

250
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:20,639
this is recursion
 

251
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,790
this is recursion
with passing the loser left it's a

252
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:22,800
with passing the loser left it's a
 

253
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,390
with passing the loser left it's a
smaller problem

254
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:24,400
smaller problem
 

255
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,430
smaller problem
yeah we already want to check the binary

256
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:27,440
yeah we already want to check the binary
 

257
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,830
yeah we already want to check the binary
tree with some binary

258
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:29,840
tree with some binary
 

259
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,189
tree with some binary
fss functions right and now

260
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:33,199
fss functions right and now
 

261
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,110
fss functions right and now
you want to check my leg all right and

262
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:35,120
you want to check my leg all right and
 

263
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,230
you want to check my leg all right and
then you breathe

264
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:36,240
then you breathe
 

265
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,670
then you breathe
right now breathe out

266
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:39,680
right now breathe out

269
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,270

slow down come

270
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:47,280

 

271
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,629

we're gonna on it okay the right

272
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:50,639
we're gonna on it okay the right
 

273
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,150
we're gonna on it okay the right
yeah okay you want it to do it

274
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:54,160
yeah okay you want it to do it
 

275
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,589
yeah okay you want it to do it
me do it okay okay

277
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,270

equal root

278
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:03,280
equal root
 

279
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,550
equal root
it's a bit small left

280
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:06,560
it's a bit small left
 

281
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:38,710
it's a bit small left
the left no right are you kidding me

282
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:38,720

 

283
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,540

289
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,830

that's okay basically you want to copy

290
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:55,840
that's okay basically you want to copy
 

291
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,830
that's okay basically you want to copy
this playstation change the left to the

292
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:57,840
this playstation change the left to the
 

293
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,510
this playstation change the left to the
right because we will do the same thing

294
00:07:59,510 --> 00:07:59,520
right because we will do the same thing
 

295
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,070
right because we will do the same thing
for the right choice right so now at

this point
x if how can we check if it is not a

300
00:08:06,309 --> 00:08:06,319
x if how can we check if it is not a
 

301

leaf note
 

303
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:25,189
leaf note
oh it doesn't have any kills so if what

304
00:08:25,189 --> 00:08:25,199

 

305
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,869

it doesn't matter because look this oh

315
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,550
don't guess okay what do you mean oh
one of them is two then it's two two or

316
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:58,560
one of them is two then it's two two or
 

317
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,750
one of them is two then it's two two or
four

318

four
 

319
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,829
four
five three one of them is two is true so

320
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:03,839
five three one of them is two is true so
 

321
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,070
five three one of them is two is true so
one eleven is true so what give me the

322
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:06,080
one eleven is true so what give me the
 

323
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,350
one eleven is true so what give me the
final answer

324

two of us i said
 

327
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:15,430
two of us i said
three fourths or two four so

328
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:15,440
three fourths or two four so
 

329
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,590
three fourths or two four so
three fourth or fourth four five
