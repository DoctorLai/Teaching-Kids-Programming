00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:32,559
today's task is given a string and we
 

25
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:33,510
today's task is given a string and we
want to remove

26
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:33,520
want to remove
 

27
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,630
want to remove
all the valves in it for example like

28
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:36,640
all the valves in it for example like
 

29
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,990
all the valves in it for example like
a b e o

30

given this function and to remove all
the vowels you should give me

36
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:45,760
the vowels you should give me
 

37
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,910
the vowels you should give me
b d d that's it

38

39
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,750

okay so what's the approach of doing

40
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:51,760
okay so what's the approach of doing
 

41
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,350
okay so what's the approach of doing
this oh you just

42
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:53,360
this oh you just
 

43
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,350
this oh you just
uh wait it's just what

00:01:01,029 --> 00:01:01,039
just take away the a e i and you just
 

47
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,670
just take away the a e i and you just
go through all of it and yeah you know

48
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:03,680
go through all of it and yeah you know
 

49
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,869
go through all of it and yeah you know
go to the all along

50
00:01:04,869 --> 00:01:04,879
go to the all along
 

51
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,070
go to the all along
all the characters in s and then if it's

52
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:08,080
all the characters in s and then if it's
 

53
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,550
all the characters in s and then if it's
vowel what do we do if it's not about

54
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:10,560
vowel what do we do if it's not about
 

55
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,429
vowel what do we do if it's not about
what we do

56
00:01:11,429 --> 00:01:11,439
what we do
 

57
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,550
what we do
keep it there keep it yes

58
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:14,560
keep it there keep it yes
 

59
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,310

yeah you you you do it tiffany
do the new okay so maybe maybe you can

62
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:21,040
do the new okay so maybe maybe you can
 

63
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,590
do the new okay so maybe maybe you can
write this

64
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:21,600
write this
 

65
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:36,390
write this
remote remove vowel

66
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:36,400

 

67
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,069

right as this empty string so how can we

68
00:01:40,069 --> 00:01:40,079
right as this empty string so how can we
 

69
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,270
right as this empty string so how can we
iterate over the string for i and s

70
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:43,280
iterate over the string for i and s
 

71
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,550
iterate over the string for i and s
for i in s column and then look

72
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:46,560
for i in s column and then look
 

73
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,069
for i in s column and then look
what if one if each eye

74
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:50,079
what if one if each eye
 

75
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,149
what if one if each eye
is not in a vowel right so how can we

76
00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:52,159
is not in a vowel right so how can we
 

77
00:01:52,159 --> 00:02:06,830
is not in a vowel right so how can we
draw this

78
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:06,840

what's the space complexity
 

103
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,470
what's the space complexity
okay

00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:54,480

 

105
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,670

okay that's it and because we know that

actually we need to
 

131
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,830
actually we need to
check how many times in the worst case

132

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,470
if we want to check if i
five times if it's a if it's e if i so

136
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:56,480
five times if it's a if it's e if i so
 

137
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,070

00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:25,199
if uh if i'm not in
 

159
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,710
if uh if i'm not in
vowels right right and then answer the

160
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:28,720
vowels right right and then answer the
 

161
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,390
vowels right right and then answer the
opening and then it still should work

162
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:30,400

okay all right

164
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:31,440
okay all right
 

165
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,430

terms

170
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:36,240
terms
 

171
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,629
terms
extremely very very fast going through

172
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:38,639
extremely very very fast going through
 

173
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,790
extremely very very fast going through
the characters one time right

174
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:40,800
the characters one time right
 

175
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,110
the characters one time right
and we're using the answer to append the

176
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:43,120
and we're using the answer to append the
 

177
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,990
and we're using the answer to append the
characters that

178
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,000
characters that
 

179
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,950
characters that
are not in the vowels right it's only

180
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:46,960
are not in the vowels right it's only
 

181
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,790
are not in the vowels right it's only
four minutes that's okay that's okay

182
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:48,800
four minutes that's okay that's okay
 

183
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,550
four minutes that's okay that's okay
and we're going to use a few

184
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:52,560
and we're going to use a few
 

185
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,909
and we're going to use a few
few things yeah here so look one

186
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:55,919
few things yeah here so look one
 

187
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,150
few things yeah here so look one
another way of doing this is using the

188
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:58,160
another way of doing this is using the
 

189
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,909
another way of doing this is using the
replace function the string has a

190
00:04:59,909 --> 00:04:59,919
replace function the string has a
 

191
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,990
replace function the string has a
replace function so you can say

192
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,000
replace function so you can say
 

193
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,830
replace function so you can say
look if you say a b c dot replace

194
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:05,840

uh something something sweet is from
chinese okay you are bbc youtube okay

224
00:05:42,469 --> 00:05:42,479
chinese okay you are bbc youtube okay
 

225
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:43,749
chinese okay you are bbc youtube okay
bbc iplayer

226
00:05:43,749 --> 00:05:43,759
bbc iplayer
 

227
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,550
bbc iplayer
on your tv you cannot read that now okay

228
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:46,560
on your tv you cannot read that now okay
 

229
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,189
on your tv you cannot read that now okay
okay

230
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:47,199
okay
 

231
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,510
okay
so look how can we use these functions

232
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:49,520
so look how can we use these functions
 

233
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,070
so look how can we use these functions
to remove all the vowels in the string

234
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:52,080
to remove all the vowels in the string
 

235
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,189
to remove all the vowels in the string
oh we just we need to replace all the

236
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:55,199
oh we just we need to replace all the
 

237
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,670
oh we just we need to replace all the
vowels with each one

238
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:57,680
vowels with each one
 

239
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,110
vowels with each one
with just nothing nothing yeah when you

240
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:01,120
with just nothing nothing yeah when you
 

241
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,350
with just nothing nothing yeah when you
place the vowels with nothing then

242
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:03,360
place the vowels with nothing then
 

243
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,070
place the vowels with nothing then
eventually that's that's removing it but

244
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,080
eventually that's that's removing it but
 

245
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,830
eventually that's that's removing it but
you so you can say return

246
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:07,840
you so you can say return
 

247
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,590
you so you can say return
s dot replace a nothing stop

248
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:11,600
s dot replace a nothing stop
 

249
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,390
s dot replace a nothing stop
yeah you keep doing that don't play b

250
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:16,400

 

251
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,629

it will take time to write yeah nothing

252
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:18,639
it will take time to write yeah nothing
 

253
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,550
it will take time to write yeah nothing
and detail

254
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:20,560
and detail
 

255
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,830
and detail
replace i nothing replace oh nothing

256

replace u nothing right
 

259
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,950
replace u nothing right
yeah okay then we can do this

260
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:28,960
yeah okay then we can do this
 

261
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,710
yeah okay then we can do this
we can do a loop right we can do this

262
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:30,720
we can do a loop right we can do this
 

263
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,550
we can do a loop right we can do this
for i

264
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:32,560
for i
 

265
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,110
for i
in a e i o u yeah right

266
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:37,120
in a e i o u yeah right
 

267
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,629
in a e i o u yeah right
s equals s dot replace

268
00:06:40,629 --> 00:06:40,639
s equals s dot replace
 

269
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,830
s equals s dot replace
replace i with y

270
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:43,840
replace i with y
 

271
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,029
replace i with y
i with the

272
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:47,039
i with the
 

273
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,950
i with the
return s so look f i will be a

274
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:50,960
return s so look f i will be a
 

275
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,270
return s so look f i will be a
i o u yeah will iterate five times and i

276
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:53,280
i o u yeah will iterate five times and i
 

277
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,350
i o u yeah will iterate five times and i
want to replace with i with one

278
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:55,360
want to replace with i with one
 

279
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,550
want to replace with i with one
how do i replace it with with to remove

280
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:58,560
how do i replace it with with to remove
 

281
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,270
how do i replace it with with to remove
it

282
00:06:59,270 --> 00:06:59,280
it
 

283
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,230
it
uh nothing nothing yeah nothing let that

284
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:02,240
uh nothing nothing yeah nothing let that
 

285
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:02,629
uh nothing nothing yeah nothing let that

return chinese character okay
 

289
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,870
return chinese character okay
so this is a replace yeah and we also

290
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:08,880
so this is a replace yeah and we also
 

291
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,990
so this is a replace yeah and we also
can

292
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:10,000
can
 

293
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,189
can
use the write it in a very nice uh way

294
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:13,199
use the write it in a very nice uh way
 

295
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,029
use the write it in a very nice uh way
of list look eric pretend

then we can slowly see for c

300
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:23,680
then we can slowly see for c
 

301
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,950
then we can slowly see for c
in s if c

302

okay that's another way of doing it and
 

307
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,469
okay that's another way of doing it and
we also can use them

308
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:38,479
we also can use them
 

309
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:39,830
we also can use them
sorry what difference yeah yeah of

310
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:39,840
sorry what difference yeah yeah of

course i'm just yeah define
and then return this okay course and we

314
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:43,919
and then return this okay course and we
 

315
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,749
and then return this okay course and we
can use the filter filter function

316
00:07:45,749 --> 00:07:45,759
can use the filter filter function
 

317
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,830
can use the filter filter function
theater is the function to

335
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,390
so look there's a there's a
something like that and it's a very

336
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:10,400
something like that and it's a very
 

337
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,710
something like that and it's a very
small hole and then if you give

338
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:12,720
small hole and then if you give
 

339
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,510
small hole and then if you give
put all the sand and the bigger sand

340
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:15,520
put all the sand and the bigger sand
 

341
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,629
put all the sand and the bigger sand
stays out

342
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:16,639
stays out
 

343
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,070
stays out
up right the smallest end goes through

344
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,080
up right the smallest end goes through
 

345
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,150
up right the smallest end goes through
so let's call the theater yeah

346
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:22,160
so let's call the theater yeah
 

347
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,990
so let's call the theater yeah
uh yeah it doesn't make sense so it's

348
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:24,000
uh yeah it doesn't make sense so it's
 

349
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,390
uh yeah it doesn't make sense so it's
like the whole string here are you under

350
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:26,400
like the whole string here are you under
 

351
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,189
like the whole string here are you under
the theater

352
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:27,199
the theater

only the noun vowels goes through the
 

355
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,469
only the noun vowels goes through the
vowels stay here right

356
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:32,479
vowels stay here right
 

357
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,589
vowels stay here right
all right yes so theater

all right yes so theater
 

359
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,230
all right yes so theater
there's a function function function and

360
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:38,240
there's a function function function and
 

361
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,350
there's a function function function and
then input right

362
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:39,360
then input right
 

363
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,029
then input right
input so let's s and it will give us a

364
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:43,039
input so let's s and it will give us a
 

365
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,790
input so let's s and it will give us a
a list of a list of

366
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:46,800
a list of a list of
 

367
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,350
a list of a list of
a generator of a list right so this

368
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:49,360
a generator of a list right so this
 

369
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,790
a generator of a list right so this
function look we can

370
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:50,800
function look we can
 

371
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,030
function look we can
do this join johnny's right

372
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:55,040
do this join johnny's right
 

373
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,710
do this join johnny's right
all right return journalists but this

374
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:56,720
all right return journalists but this
 

375
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,350
all right return journalists but this
function we can define what

376
00:08:59,350 --> 00:08:59,360
function we can define what
 

377
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,269
function we can define what
define this function x we need to define

378
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:03,279
define this function x we need to define
 

379
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,870
define this function x we need to define
if it's not a vowel right x

380
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:06,880
if it's not a vowel right x
 

381
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,949
if it's not a vowel right x
return x not in one

382
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:10,959
return x not in one
 

383
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,230
return x not in one
right yeah that's it so we

384
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:14,240
right yeah that's it so we
 

385
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,350
right yeah that's it so we
return join theater

386
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:17,360
return join theater
 

387
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,750
return join theater
function s that's it and this function

388
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:19,760
function s that's it and this function
 

389
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,750
function s that's it and this function
is you need to give it this function

390
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:21,760
is you need to give it this function
 

391
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,150
is you need to give it this function
but we can also remove this function we

392
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:24,160
but we can also remove this function we
 

393
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,590
but we can also remove this function we
don't need to declare this we can use

394
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:25,600
don't need to declare this we can use
 

395
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,630
don't need to declare this we can use
the one line thing

396
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:26,640
the one line thing
 

397
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,670
the one line thing
called lambda yeah so instead only of

398
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:29,680
called lambda yeah so instead only of
 

399
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,030
called lambda yeah so instead only of
this we can do this

400
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:31,040
this we can do this
 

401
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:42,230
this we can do this
we can fit it with lambda

402
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:42,240

 

403
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,990

yeah you see so you

404
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,000
yeah you see so you
 

405
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,670
yeah you see so you
it's 1 9 return empty string dot join

406
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:49,680
it's 1 9 return empty string dot join
 

407
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,110
it's 1 9 return empty string dot join
theater lambda comma s and let

408
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:53,120
theater lambda comma s and let
 

409
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,110
theater lambda comma s and let
that level be linked to one line right

410
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:55,120
that level be linked to one line right
 

411
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,750
that level be linked to one line right
another way yeah another way so how many

412
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:57,760
another way yeah another way so how many
 

413
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,350
another way yeah another way so how many
there's so many ways how many ways you

414
00:09:59,350 --> 00:09:59,360
there's so many ways how many ways you
 

415
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,430
there's so many ways how many ways you
remember so far

416
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:01,440
remember so far
 

417
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,430
remember so far
okay not really you know you're not

remembering any of this
 

421
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,350
remembering any of this
anyone okay let's not define remove

422
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:09,360
anyone okay let's not define remove
 

423
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,310
anyone okay let's not define remove
that's that's why

424
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:10,320
that's that's why
 

425
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,670
that's that's why
right together remove vowels

426
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:13,680
right together remove vowels

look but one one thing you have to you
 

475
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,389
look but one one thing you have to you
need to have a space

476
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:54,399
need to have a space
 

477
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:55,829
need to have a space
right when you go to when you have a

478
00:11:55,829 --> 00:11:55,839
right when you go to when you have a
 

479
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,670
right when you go to when you have a
column you need to have a space

480
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:57,680
column you need to have a space
 

481
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,949
column you need to have a space
yeah this needs to shift in here right

482
00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:00,959
yeah this needs to shift in here right
 

483
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,550
yeah this needs to shift in here right
doesn't make sense and this needs to

484
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:02,560
doesn't make sense and this needs to
 

485
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,509
doesn't make sense and this needs to
come with that yeah yeah

486
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:05,519
come with that yeah yeah
 

487
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:22,829
come with that yeah yeah
for c that's e is

488
