yeah okay so we're given a sentence yeah

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:12,960
and sentence s equals

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:16,599
e let's say i write the ascendant e r

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,599

ryan eric is ryan's good friend what's

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,039
wrong with that

17
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,160
okay

18
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:53,440
so we want to capitalize this words in a

19
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:56,320
sentence in such a way first of all

20
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,320
what's philosophy

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,840
last thing okay so don't worry about the

22
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,600
possibility okay

23
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,799
so lee is our letter there are only

24
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:08,000
letters what space in the sentences and

25
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,400
we want to capitalize the sentences in

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,240
in such way if the letter if a word is

27
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,080
less or

28
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,479
less than one two letters okay if it's

29
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,439
two letters or less then we make it all

30
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:22,560
up a lowercase which is is

31
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,840
otherwise for others we want to

32
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,159
capitalize

33
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,960
make the first letter uppercase and all

34
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,159
the rest lowercase so this will be e i i

35
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,159
c f

36
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,240
r y a n

37
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,360
g o o d

38
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,280
f r i e n d okay

39
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,600
clear

40
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,880
yeah look this is very special only the

41
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,720
very special okay if we if that word has

42
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,880
two letters or less then we make it all

43
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,119
lowercase uh

44
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,799
okay okay

45
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,600
okay so what's your all your thoughts

46
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,320
how can we do it

47
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,560
how can we do this

48
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,079
[Music]

49
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,730
okay so we want to find out the first

50
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:07,040
letter of the word to make it

51
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:09,200
[Music]

52
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,520
so the first um is the string how can we

53
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,720
get the words extra words from the

54
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,640
string

55
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,480
remember we get it

56
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,360
how do we get it

57
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,360
we

58
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,360
how do we get it how do we copy

59
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,640
so

60
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,680
the computer sees it what do you mean

61
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,920
computer scissors computer computer sees

62
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,000
it how how can computer seizing

63
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,959
find the noise but it's

64
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,180
okay come on come on seriously how can

65
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,920
we do it how can the computer do it

66
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:41,680
[Music]

67
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,000
what are the separators between the

68
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,000
words

69
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,720
split and join spirit and john that's

70
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,519
the word okay so this is as if we split

71
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,640
it

72
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,480
by the spaces okay five spaces what we

73
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:00,879
have got is one

74
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:03,040
is a list of a string list of strings

75
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,120
these are a list of string lists of

76
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,920
words like that

77
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,080
yeah

78
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,120
i s

79
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,920
i y a and s

80
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,280
okay

81
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,800
i'm going to write it

82
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,680
i'm not going to write it okay now

83
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,560
i split it look from here to here is

84
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,879
what

85
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,680
s dot split

86
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,760
yeah

87
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,519
and we have this then we go through each

88
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,239
word

89
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,760
and we check if the letter if the word

90
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,440
has the length

91
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,360
lower smaller

92
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,360
and equal than two then we make it all

93
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,599
lowercase yeah remember how do we make

94
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,760
it lowercase

95
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:44,959
if this is worth something we make it

96
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,959
lower okay stop lower

97
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,920
and how about how about this if you want

98
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,159
to make this

99
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,640
first letter uppercase the rest

100
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,720
lowercase so what's this if this is one

101
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,959
okay for w

102
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,959
in

103
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,680
okay so we can say if

104
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,760
length w

105
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,560
smaller or equal than

106
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,400
two then w to lower right

107
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,199
yeah

108
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,799
otherwise what otherwise what how can we

109
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,280
how can we make the first letter

110
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:23,919
uppercase then the rest will be

111
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,919
lowercase

112
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,479
so what was the first letter

113
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,240
w you'll be w0 right the first letter i

114
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,919
only need to the uppercase

115
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,080
after

116
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,199
and the rest will be lowercase i need to

117
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,840
plus

118
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:43,759
w 1 to the n dot location

119
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,000
right

120
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,000
yeah

121
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,919
does it make sense this one

122
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,000
the first letter is zero

123
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,960
are only in uppercase plus

124
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,440
from

125
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,520
the second character to the end and only

126
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,680
lowercase right yeah

127
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,680
okay so by python we have another

128
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,320
function okay look at me you don't need

129
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,840
to write this this bit of

130
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:13,919
crap okay yeah not

131
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:15,680
crap okay so you can write it look w

132
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,120
can you guess the word

133
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,320
t

134
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,000
i

135
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:24,600
p

136
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,600
t y there are two letters here

137
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,400
tighter tighter will do the exactly the

138
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,440
same so you make the first letter

139
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,120
uppercase and the red noise

140
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,280
yeah

141
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,919
but if we want to implement it ourselves

142
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:45,039
the first letter uppercase plus

143
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,479
okay can you explain to me what this is

144
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,680
number two

145
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,680
no if it's uh

146
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,840
that's the index start from the second

147
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,880
letter to the end right

148
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:01,600
yeah so so let the first letter w zero e

149
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:04,880
the uppercase then you become e

150
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,479
and then w one to the end will be

151
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,440
this bit

152
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:11,600
make it all lowercase so you'll be

153
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,440
ah ic and you press it together it will

154
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,400
be etheric

155
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,639
yeah

156
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,639
okay so let me write it okay let me go

157
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,639
ahead

158
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,880
instead having a hiccup

159
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,880
drink more water

160
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,120
defy

161
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,120
okay let's say capitalized

162
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,680
okay i don't know how to spell this word

163
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,680
s

164
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,919
s is a sentence and then let's split it

165
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,960
by the

166
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,160
by uh to a list of words okay so let's

167
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,199
say

168
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,400
array

169
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:53,759
let's say was okay what

170
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,759
equal s dot split

171
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,000
okay you can given a space but without

172
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,720
giving a space you can treat you can

173
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,120
treat much of a space at the time okay

174
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,080
so let's say split and then we can say

175
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,160
what

176
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,840
for

177
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,840
for i

178
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,319
w in

179
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:18,319
enumerate yeah we will

180
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:20,240
get the index enumerate what

181
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,720
right we're going to the index i will be

182
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:26,240
the index 0 1 2 3

183
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,720
and w will be the word there like e

184
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,919
e r i c

185
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,599
uh

186
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:35,360
is

187
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,360
etcetera okay etc

188
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,160
so now

189
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,039
look

190
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,319
if

191
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:45,440
length of the word is smaller than equal

192
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:48,479
than two then i want it to

193
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,479
be all lowercase so i will have this

194
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,840
what

195
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:56,879
i

196
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,879
equals w dot lower right

197
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,520
ass

198
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,560
was i

199
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,599
remember all we have to talk about left

200
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,319
we want to make the first capital

201
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:13,360
uh uppercase this the rest lowercase so

202
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:17,120
we use that function which is what

203
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:19,680
title p-i-t-a and that's it and then now

204
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,360
the word is the modified

205
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,960
it's the modified

206
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,840
list of words how can we make it a

207
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,560
string again

208
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,400
split

209
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,720
no no no how can we make a list of

210
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,120
string by

211
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,000
what's the opposite of i mean

212
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,360
we

213
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,680
yeah yeah join join come we return

214
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,719
empty space.join

215
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:45,600
join what okay

216
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:48,880
yeah can you have a look at this come on

217
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,880
can you have look at this

218
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,640
yeah

219
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,100
uh what's immunity come on what's in my

220
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,040
neck

221
00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:00,399
[Music]

222
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,200
what does the immune give us the

223
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,560
what's

224
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,680
talk about this

225
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,680
what's enumerate come on

226
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,200
look at me come on what's fighting so

227
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,200
busy

228
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,399
what's your number here

229
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,240
one or zero yeah

230
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,440
so what does it give us if we without

231
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,240
the enumerate you give up it's like the

232
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,760
index um yeah indexing give me the index

233
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,320
right zero one two three and then the

234
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,720
value of w will be the value okay

235
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,040
yeah okay so

236
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,120
how about if we we can do it another way

237
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,880
look this is the easy way because we use

238
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,800
this title function

239
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,720
yeah this is already

240
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,959
there we can just use it we don't need

241
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,000
to reinvent the wheel right

242
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,399
all right

243
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,279
but if we we are not allowed to use

244
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,720
these

245
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,839
if we are not allowed to use this

246
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:58,640
function and we are not allowed to use

247
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,720
the split function okay how can we do it

248
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,800
right

249
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,200
very very tricky okay let's say look e

250
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,640
e-r-i-c is

251
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,680
a

252
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,079
good

253
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,279
toy all right

254
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,360
like that

255
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:16,320
so

256
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,720
orion yeah i have a ryan here okay yeah

257
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,519
so look

258
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,320
so

259
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:25,200
i can have two pointers i points to the

260
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,560
beginning of the first each word and

261
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,279
then j

262
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:32,079
j will be moving to the end

263
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:34,160
that j will be moving moving moving when

264
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,920
you move when it meets a

265
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,720
space

266
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,320
then i check the last word if it's more

267
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,480
than two

268
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,920
if it's more than two

269
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,360
then

270
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,240
no one

271
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,000
if it's more than two will happen

272
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,839
if it's more than two then i set the

273
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,480
first character to uppercase all the

274
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:57,519
rest will be lowercase and i move on and

275
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:00,240
i i move the i

276
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:02,079
to the to the beginning of next word and

277
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,600
i keep moving keep moving if it's

278
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,760
smaller than two

279
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,600
then i set everything to

280
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,800
lowercase right

281
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:14,399
and i move to two to three n until i

282
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:16,560
reaches the end makes sense

283
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,399
okay can you explain to me what did they

284
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,640
just say

285
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:23,360
what's i what's j what's iron want to

286
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:26,000
say i point to the beginning of each one

287
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,959
yeah and what's j j is character by the

288
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,959
girl movie

289
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,880
yeah we we use this in beard functions

290
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,440
doing functions to spread to break a

291
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:52,560
sentence into a list of words okay well

292
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:55,279
this is kind of like a quick easy way

293
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,920
but we were also talking about

294
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,450
how can we do it without the help of

295
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,720
these kind of functions yeah

296
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:03,680
[Music]

297
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:07,440
and let's quickly do it come on everyone

298
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,440
can we can we pay attention please

299
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,120
define

300
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,320
capitalize

301
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,040
s

302
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:18,000
okay so at the beginning we have two

303
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,880
pointers here i equals j equals zero

304
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,279
right

305
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,839
and then the end will be

306
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,959
the length of a

307
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:26,240
string yeah

308
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,560
so now

309
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,560
why

310
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,839
why let's say if j points to the

311
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,600
beginning let's say okay

312
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,880
i smaller

313
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:41,120
or equal than n okay

314
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:44,639
and then i need to do what then i need

315
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,639
to check if s i

316
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,480
equal equal n if it reaches the end or s

317
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,399
i

318
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,720
is empty space

319
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:57,279
then this is then look what happened

320
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,200
here what's what's this condition what's

321
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:02,160
this condition

322
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,160
what does it mean here

323
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,680
if if it look

324
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:13,120
uh actually no if i equals the n okay

325
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:16,160
sorry if i reaches the n or s i equals

326
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,240
empty space what does it mean

327
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:22,560
okay this is a space array

328
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:25,120
is a good boy okay now

329
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,200
i is here now what happened

330
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,600
oh i is here what happened what should

331
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,600
we do now

332
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,040
keep

333
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,279
so we have this word already right so j

334
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,760
you'll be here right j is here

335
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,440
so i need to make i need to check the

336
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,519
length of this one right so what's the

337
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,160
length of this what

338
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:55,360
if this is i this is what's the length

339
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,360
what's the length of the word

340
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:05,279
yeah that's it

341
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:08,079
now we need to check if if i minus j if

342
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:10,800
it's bigger

343
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:12,959
right n to noise increase if if it's

344
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,399
bigger than two bigger or even two what

345
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,639
should we do

346
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,399
it's bigger than two right because

347
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,560
if it's bigger than two then i need to

348
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,560
set

349
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,040
i mean

350
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,600
s j

351
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,519
equals f j

352
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,279
dot upper right

353
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,800
yeah

354
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:39,199
all right

355
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:42,480
s j equals f j dot upper and then

356
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:46,399
and then what then j equals i'm then j j

357
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:48,560
needs to be what j needs to be where

358
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,639
this needs to set to be upper so now

359
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,440
it's after now what's j j is going to be

360
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,279
one

361
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,040
j is going to jump to where which

362
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,920
position

363
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,720
i

364
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,720
is here is

365
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:07,600
better okay so what's eye letter this is

366
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:11,120
i this is either so what's either this

367
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:14,480
one we're done okay so now j needs to

368
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,360
jump to i plus one right okay now look

369
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,000
uh

370
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,000
okay so now

371
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,240
oh okay so now

372
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,880
s here as this bit

373
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,760
okay so if it hasn't reached the letters

374
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,759
yes so we need to set everything into

375
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:32,639
lowercase right so i will set everything

376
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,639
into lowercase

377
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,639
okay

378
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,639
so big why is that because everything

379
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,839
look i can just

380
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,800
convert everything to lowercase

381
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,759
and

382
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,920
i look listen to me i can turn

383
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,240
everything into lowercase first and then

384
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,480
only make the first letter capitalized

385
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,000
if the word has more than

386
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,079
two letters right

387
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,040
all right does it is it the same

388
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,279
so look

389
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,399
if it hasn't reached the what what

390
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:06,320
boundary

391
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,320
if we haven't reached the word boundary

392
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,000
i set everything to lower case right and

393
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,920
if it reaches the boundary

394
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,800
i need to check the word then if it's

395
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,880
what more than one or two words we we

396
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,279
set the first beginning of the word

397
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:24,160
characterized right

398
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:26,320
okay so first of all this s is to be a

399
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,240
it's a string which we can modify

400
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,480
because the string in python is

401
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,079
immutable what's your multiple you can't

402
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,160
change it you can do that there's one

403
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:36,959
way of thinking which is what let's say

404
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:40,240
okay let's let's make this uh

405
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:42,320
let's say a sentence okay sentence

406
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,160
and then this sentence is a string and i

407
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,079
want to make a s

408
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,880
equals this

409
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,880
this sentence

410
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,720
all right

411
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:56,399
this function it's like it's kind of

412
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:59,199
break but it's not look look a b c yeah

413
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,720
i want to break it into

414
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,160
a

415
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,839
b

416
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,839
c look at me

417
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:11,919
yeah abc this is a string i want to make

418
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,839
it a list and i i just need to read

419
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,240
list and you make me a list so look

420
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,760
sentence is a string immutable

421
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,480
i make it a list

422
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:23,199
s is a rate of words

423
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,199
a rate of characters right so a rate of

424
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,039
characters and then i can change it and

425
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,640
then after changing i just need to

426
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,880
return

427
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,120
uh i i just need to return what

428
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,840
i want to make it a sentence again i

429
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,320
have

430
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,559
now i have a list of characters now i

431
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:42,559
want to make it a string so how can we

432
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:44,930
do it how can convert convert it back

433
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:46,240
return
