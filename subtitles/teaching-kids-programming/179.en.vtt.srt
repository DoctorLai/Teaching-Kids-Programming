which are even yeah what are the inside
even numbers

30
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:56,000
even numbers
 

31
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,869
even numbers
okay so if we did this yes we did this

32
00:00:58,869 --> 00:00:58,879

we did
this and look what are the even numbers

36
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:01,440
this and look what are the even numbers
 

37
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,790
this and look what are the even numbers
now

38
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:02,800
now
 

39
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,149

00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:29,040
yeah okay so any idea how we open this
 

63
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,990
yeah okay so any idea how we open this
problem

64
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:34,000

 

65

yeah but we talked about deficits today
okay yeah okay so how are we solving

72
00:01:41,109 --> 00:01:41,119
okay yeah okay so how are we solving
 

73
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,069
okay yeah okay so how are we solving
this look

74
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:42,079

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,229
this is the look look at me look at here
yeah this is the loop now i'm calling

170
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:00,239
yeah this is the loop now i'm calling
 

171
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,550
yeah this is the loop now i'm calling
the recursion to do the job

172
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:04,560
the recursion to do the job
 

173
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,110
the recursion to do the job
yeah do the job for the left tree and

174
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:07,120
yeah do the job for the left tree and
 

175
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,949
yeah do the job for the left tree and
the right tree right

176
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:08,959
the right tree right
 

177
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,429
the right tree right
okay yeah and after that what should we

178
00:04:11,429 --> 00:04:11,439
okay yeah and after that what should we
 

179
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:16,629
okay yeah and after that what should we
do next

180
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:16,639

 

181
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,110

and then if this dude becomes the leave

182
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:19,120
and then if this dude becomes the leave
 

183
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,949
and then if this dude becomes the leave
again

184
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:20,959
again
 

185
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,909
again
yeah so what does it mean look if canvas

186
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:25,919

 

187
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,230

how do we check if the root balloon is

188
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:28,240
how do we check if the root balloon is
 

189
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,189
how do we check if the root balloon is
the leaf now

190
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:29,199
the leaf now
 

191
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,310
the leaf now
now because i already did that

192
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:32,320
now because i already did that
 

193
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,950
now because i already did that
you know apply this function to the left

194
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:34,960
you know apply this function to the left
 

195
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,550
you know apply this function to the left
string and to the right tree

196
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:36,560
string and to the right tree
 

197
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,469
string and to the right tree
and it might be possible that these two

198
00:04:38,469 --> 00:04:38,479
and it might be possible that these two
 

199
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,230
and it might be possible that these two
will be removed yeah because

200
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:40,240
will be removed yeah because
 

201
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,670
will be removed yeah because
yeah all right so and now if we check

202
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:43,680
yeah all right so and now if we check
 

203
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,350
yeah all right so and now if we check
the root is the difference so how can we

204
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:45,360
the root is the difference so how can we
 

205
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,990
the root is the difference so how can we
say it would do within the leaf now

206
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:48,000
say it would do within the leaf now
 

207
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,830
say it would do within the leaf now
how can we check if the low is the leaf

208
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:49,840
how can we check if the low is the leaf
 

209
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,070
how can we check if the low is the leaf
now if blue

210
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,080
now if blue
 

211
00:04:52,080 --> 00:05:02,950
now if blue
what really does left

212
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:02,960

 

213
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,230

so what does it mean what does it mean

214
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:06,240
so what does it mean what does it mean
 

215
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:14,320
so what does it mean what does it mean
every the value what

216
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:14,330

 

217
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:33,830

[Music]

218
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:33,840

 

219
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,189

does not have any kid ali

220
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:37,199
does not have any kid ali
 

221
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,510
does not have any kid ali
yeah it's a leaf now now right yeah if

222
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:39,520
yeah it's a leaf now now right yeah if
 

223
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,870
yeah it's a leaf now now right yeah if
it's a leaf now

224
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:40,880
it's a leaf now
 

225
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,070
it's a leaf now
then if root of value you can't divide

226
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:44,080
then if root of value you can't divide
 

227
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,870
then if root of value you can't divide
by three

228
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:44,880
by three
 

229
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,070
by three
yeah or modular two or n one yeah equals

230
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:48,080
yeah or modular two or n one yeah equals
 

231
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,830
yeah or modular two or n one yeah equals
zero

232
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:49,840
zero
 

233
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,430
zero
and then what should we do if it's a

234
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:51,440
and then what should we do if it's a
 

235
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,189
and then what should we do if it's a
loop

236
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:55,199

 

237
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,270

return now because now if it's the leaf

238
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:57,280
return now because now if it's the leaf
 

239
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,029
return now because now if it's the leaf
now i will move it

240
00:05:59,029 --> 00:05:59,039
now i will move it
 

241
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:16,950
now i will move it
otherwise here yeah yeah

242
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:16,960

 

243
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:43,760

because we need to go through

244
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:43,770

 

245
00:06:43,770 --> 00:07:03,450

[Music]

248
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:15,120

 

249
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,469

2 you can also write it as n one right

250
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:18,479
2 you can also write it as n one right
 

251
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,870
2 you can also write it as n one right
equals zero it's the same thing yeah

252
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:20,880
equals zero it's the same thing yeah
 

253
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,230
equals zero it's the same thing yeah
yeah this is one

254
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:22,240
yeah this is one
 

255
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,870
yeah this is one
right and one this is binary yeah that

256
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:24,880
right and one this is binary yeah that
 

257
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,990
right and one this is binary yeah that
doesn't make sense

258
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:26,000
doesn't make sense
 

259
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,319
doesn't make sense
okay that's it for today
