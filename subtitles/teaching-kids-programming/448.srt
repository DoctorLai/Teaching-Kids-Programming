1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
you go hello mr harry mr ryan are you

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:05,600
right

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,040
yeah okay okay so we have talked about

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,120
the tree detection

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,360
that left for three days okay

6
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,679
for two days actually we talked about uh

7
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,000
different structure we talked about uh

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,680
search so basically we're given this a

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,160
graph and left and right uh representing

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,920
the left child and right side of the

11
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,840
note i right no i i from zero to n minus

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,439
one and we want to find out if this

13
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,200
given graph is a it's a tree right it's

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,520
a tree it's basically financing because

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,360
there's only left and right left right

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,640
away okay

17
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,440
so

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,000
so

19
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,520
in order for god to be a tree so what

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,360
makes a

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,840
what makes it a tree

22
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,239
it's not true so what makes is a tree so

23
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,039
what are we looking for connecting yes

24
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,960
no cycles no cycle connected yeah so we

25
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,840
want to find out the root the root is

26
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,640
that no acceptable yeah

27
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,879
is the only node that has a

28
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,760
zero in degree okay has a zero in degree

29
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:09,360
okay so if we have more than

30
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,200
do one node that has uh zero in degree

31
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,439
then that is not connected right so it

32
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,840
could be something like these right this

33
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,960
is we have two notes look at my mini

34
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,280
phone okay okay we have two notes

35
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,640
look at this one is the three it's a

36
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,960
piece of three

37
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,960
no yeah why is that it's not connected

38
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:41,439
is this uh

39
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,399
no

40
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:46,159
numbers and it has a cycle okay you have

41
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,759
cycles okay don't worry about the

42
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,079
numbers okay

43
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,840
okay and how about this this is a tricky

44
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:55,680
one how about this one how about this

45
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:58,240
one how about this one is this a note i

46
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,640
one two three nine why is that yes

47
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,079
because it has two groups

48
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,119
uh well done yes two roots it

49
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,960
yes

50
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,520
yeah it's connected but it has two roots

51
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,680
but this one is a special it's a case

52
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,040
that it shows that one pair one note has

53
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,120
two pairs but in a tree in a tree what

54
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,280
do we have how many how many parent

55
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,879
maximum parents can send a note have in

56
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,760
the final three two

57
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,599
the parent the parent no kids one yes

58
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,800
what is that

59
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,879
okay

60
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,930
okay come on come on come on

61
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,009
okay so now

62
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:33,009
[Applause]

63
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,040
okay um that's it okay so we talked

64
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,920
about the default third yeah i'm

65
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,680
question

66
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,040
area

67
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,360
here this is constantly in degree right

68
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,480
right with counting the integra

69
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,440
integration

70
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,200
even it has more than one degree so what

71
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,879
happened if you have no one has more

72
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,360
than one name degree

73
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,120
then it's not a root right obviously and

74
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,680
now we are not we are finding the root

75
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,159
and then we do this by factoring we want

76
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,480
to make sure that each node from each

77
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,640
node can be visited exactly one from the

78
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,879
root okay and then at the end we check

79
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,280
that the node visited is the executive

80
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,720
end node right now okay

81
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,879
so

82
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,200
so today we talked about uh we want to

83
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:21,840
talk about the same uh

84
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,840
some problem

85
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,159
we want to find out we want to use

86
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,310
another algorithm which is called the

87
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:31,409
strong set yeah

88
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:31,409
[Music]

89
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:43,879
[Music]

90
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,959
too much

91
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,959
oh my god this is

92
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,879
okay

93
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,120
so

94
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,120
how do we apply this to join set and

95
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,040
unify remember this joins that we have

96
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,639
these uh at the beginning we have

97
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:40,160
angular n groups and then we can have a

98
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:42,639
function to operation to union so we can

99
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,800
union two into one group or union

100
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,360
another three into one and then at the

101
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,160
end at the end if we if it's a tree how

102
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,720
many groups do we have if we look at the

103
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,800
beginning we have notes about you know a

104
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,960
tree for three if you say it's connected

105
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,960
how

106
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:08,160
[Music]

107
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,720
to solve this problem but okay so let's

108
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,960
let's do this union fire again okay this

109
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,240
screw is set okay let's see let's say

110
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:19,120
too much too much errors right too much

111
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,320
too much so destroy that i just need a

112
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,320
better

113
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,320
pen okay

114
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:28,800
okay so first of all this shows that

115
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:32,240
let's say class disjoins that these s

116
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,240
okay ds object

117
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,560
so define

118
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,960
in it

119
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,960
graph

120
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,560
oh it means that we have n

121
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,080
at the beginning we initialize as angle

122
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,039
okay so let's say

123
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:52,000
angle so how to do that

124
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:54,479
dot plr sends your parent their parent

125
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,479
equals at the beginning you'll be angry

126
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:59,360
will be so at the beginning you'll be

127
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:01,280
initialized to uh from zero minus one so

128
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,840
we can turn these and these

129
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,960
kind of range range and range n

130
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,960
is that range range n is a iterator that

131
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,280
will give us that from zero to a minus

132
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,759
one converted to a list that fits

133
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:17,120
perfectly with this uh purpose okay and

134
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:19,759
then select parent okay so

135
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,199
we want to have a find

136
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,759
find

137
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,319
find one find x we want to find the

138
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,639
parent of x okay we find we know the

139
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:32,720
kind of parentheses remember if

140
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:35,039
it's not apparent x so look uh

141
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,560
if

142
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,479
if

143
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,520
the pair

144
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:43,280
x not equal x yeah if it's equal to x

145
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,919
and it's in the group and then we what

146
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,520
what do we do then we can reset

147
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,560
the pair

148
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,800
x equals 75

149
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,680
self defined because you'll be calling

150
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,759
it yourself to find the center pair x

151
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,360
okay i'm going to put it

152
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,720
here okay

153
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,960
and then

154
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,960
and then

155
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,120
so what does it mean okay so look this

156
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,639
is to compress the compressor

157
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,080
compress the

158
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:19,120
uh the path okay compress the task step

159
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,120
the parent if the second pair uh parent

160
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,680
x is not equal x if this is not a

161
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,160
problem we need to keep finding its

162
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,680
parent okay keep fighting is current

163
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,800
okay this is the fight and then how

164
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,960
about uh

165
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,680
define union

166
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,759
yeah union union union will put merge

167
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,400
two groups together

168
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,960
so this is a little bit more work to do

169
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,759
here okay i'm gonna write it here

170
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:47,919
come on guys sit down please

171
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:49,440
so first of all the parent group is of x

172
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,120
equals cell

173
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,479
so

174
00:07:51,120 --> 00:08:00,039
the 5 yeah we use this 5 function

175
00:07:54,479 --> 00:08:00,039
x and then py equals 7.5

176
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,400
okay so look

177
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,919
we want to merge x and y but if they

178
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,919
belong to the same group we don't need

179
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,840
to do anything right right if they

180
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:13,120
already belong to the same rule like if

181
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:15,840
px equals ti right

182
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,560
if vx equals p1 return okay

183
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,960
okay for now i'm just going to merge

184
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:24,080
from uh for uh

185
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,000
for uh for x to y or for y to x it

186
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,840
doesn't matter okay so then let's do

187
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,120
this third top

188
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,400
pair

189
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,800
p x

190
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,599
equal p y okay

191
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,120
so once we have merged it so we have one

192
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,560
more less component right and the

193
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,399
beginning okay

194
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,159
at the beginning we have angle

195
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,159
and if we merge two groups how many

196
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,959
groups left

197
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,880
how many good left

198
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:51,360
come on very easy question i have n

199
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:54,640
group and then i have merged two two

200
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,640
notes how many groups are there

201
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,200
okay so

202
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,800
so

203
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,399
at the beginning we can put another one

204
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,800
set of size

205
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,560
equals and angle right and then we are

206
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:10,000
merging one so

207
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:12,959
dot size minus equals one right yeah

208
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,680
right so the thing here is that

209
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:18,160
remember the the disjoint set

210
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:21,680
there are two group okay here

211
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,550
so you tell me which group must do it's

212
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,800
better here look

213
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:26,800
[Music]

214
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,959
okay everyone look

215
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,600
guess we'll talk about it i have a group

216
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:34,240
bigger group i have a smaller group so

217
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,320
is it better to move to attach the

218
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,160
bigger gluteus molecule of from the

219
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,440
smaller to bigger two which one you

220
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,440
think is better bigger grip teaspoon

221
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,399
smaller go to bigger book right that's

222
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:51,000
better why is that because you have

223
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,000
you only because they are

224
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,800
yeah if you attach small to

225
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:03,680
here and then the total part will be

226
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,519
more but if you attach less to

227
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,839
the total path will be less

228
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,600
right so something like that right so so

229
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:13,920
in order to do that we're going to do

230
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:16,800
this self dot side sizes okay

231
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,079
at the beginning one times n right

232
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,640
and learned

233
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,640
i realized

234
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:26,079
too much noise okay

235
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:28,399
union indian union so in here

236
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:30,079
i'm going to check right if

237
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,480
i'm going to check i'm going to check

238
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:36,000
what i'm going to check here if if the

239
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:38,720
size is if the size is several sizes p x

240
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,440
d x if it's smaller than p y along with

241
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:44,160
i i swap p x and p y so

242
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,720
the thing is i want to append the group

243
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:49,680
with less to the right to the bigger one

244
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:52,160
so if if the site if after swap the px

245
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:55,360
is bigger right if it's bigger then i

246
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:59,600
can say i want to move the py attach ui

247
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:02,240
to px then i can say save the size is

248
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,200
so size is p x

249
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,320
plus

250
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,880
equal

251
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,720
seven the size p y right and then i can

252
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:12,800
and i can

253
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:15,360
set the parent p y equal to p x

254
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,760
right okay so this is one other thing

255
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,120
okay so we see this is the disjoint set

256
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,880
we have talked about a long time ago

257
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,600
right this is the one of the data

258
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,640
structure that is useful

259
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,839
to

260
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:30,160
to do this kind of thing

261
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:32,079
we what kind of thing so you can merge

262
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,160
it's a graph data structure you can

263
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:36,800
merge different components and then at

264
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,440
least and us we can check how many

265
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,200
components how many how many groups left

266
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,800
okay so we can have at least another

267
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,480
property

268
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:49,600
at property properties define count

269
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,880
and allow cells we can save the

270
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,880
cells uh

271
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,040
which which parameter is itself the

272
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,480
sizes okay set the size return sample

273
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,440
sizes

274
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:02,079
[Music]

275
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,360
okay so now i'm going to i'm going to

276
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,920
write the

277
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,800
main thing okay which is to

278
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:11,360
i'm going to write the main thing

279
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,959
this is the white for the babies it's

280
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,440
not very good for

281
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:19,120
wiping the white board

282
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,120
easier white gold water

283
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,800
okay so so the thing is the thing is how

284
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,959
do we apply this disjoint set unified

285
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,000
into into solving this program to find

286
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:34,000
out if a

287
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,200
graph is a tree so so uh basically it's

288
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,480
it's actually

289
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,079
a lot easier

290
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,399
so normally we don't have to implement

291
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:43,040
the disturbance letter you can just uh

292
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,519
import it or maybe i mean we don't have

293
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,560
to really have to reinvent the wheel

294
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,079
every time

295
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,320
so define

296
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,320
this is tree detection okay this comes

297
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,160
the magic it's actually very simple with

298
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,360
that disturbance

299
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,600
the left

300
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,560
the right right

301
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:03,680
so like okay ts equals

302
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,880
n equals length of the left

303
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,680
this is

304
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,839
n equals length of the left

305
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,680
also length of the right

306
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,399
is the number of notes

307
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,079
of the graph or binary tree okay ds

308
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,440
equals df

309
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,839
n

310
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,760
okay

311
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:24,160
then right oh

312
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:27,440
i i'm going to iterate

313
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:29,120
i'm going to iterate i the note i in

314
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:33,760
range

315
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:36,959
and right so let's say if left eye

316
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,480
not equals minus one right if it's if it

317
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,480
so if that

318
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,800
if the node i

319
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,760
has the left node right look this is i

320
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,720
alright

321
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:48,880
look this is i if i have a decimal which

322
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,160
is left eye right

323
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,959
here

324
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:56,079
then what do we do if we have a h coming

325
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:58,160
from i to left eye what do we need to do

326
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,199
we need to do is the distance set to

327
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,040
merge it

328
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:03,040
yeah so look if there's an a

329
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,800
what does it mean

330
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,160
these two belongs to the same group

331
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:12,720
right

332
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:15,279
so what do we do look d s dot new union

333
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,399
okay now we have to do this t e f c s

334
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,680
union

335
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,839
not u

336
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,320
not union

337
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:25,360
i left i

338
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:28,240
then we return force right we can first

339
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:31,040
okay so i think we forgot about how when

340
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:34,000
in what cases we need to return unions

341
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:36,160
uh union remember the ds unions if it's

342
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,120
the same group then we return first

343
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:41,199
right if it is if if t x

344
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,680
equal equal py that will be turned forth

345
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:48,480
right return false

346
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,480
otherwise do the margin return true

347
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:53,360
right so if you if this know if these

348
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,839
two notes already belongs to the same

349
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,000
group then we'll return first

350
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,160
everyone makes sense why is that look

351
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,639
there might be another edge coming

352
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:05,040
later coming back then this will return

353
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,480
first right so that's what i mean and

354
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,600
the same thing here

355
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,680
uh

356
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,360
if right

357
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,720
if right i

358
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:17,040
not equal minus one and if not

359
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:20,480
d s dot union

360
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:22,800
i right i yeah we want to merge them

361
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,040
the note with the left tree and right

362
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,279
three return fourth

363
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,920
okay so like look there's a there's a

364
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:31,600
right eye okay i'm running out of this

365
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,279
ink this one

366
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,839
right so here

367
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,839
okay so this is all

368
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:41,720
okay for most okay but it's a special

369
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,720
case this does not attack

370
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:58,399
three points to two if

371
00:15:54,959 --> 00:16:00,560
uh it does not violate this uh

372
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,399
uh this condition look we just merge it

373
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,320
we just merge it right so it's the

374
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,360
central it doesn't matter how do we

375
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,040
check this

376
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,800
how do we check this is not allowed

377
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,839
right because look these two have two

378
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,240
parents

379
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,959
so we can use the individual if

380
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,880
number two parent yeah my mommy and my

381
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:20,320
daddy okay okay

382
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:21,600
but in binary in in data science in data

383
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,079
structure

384
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,639
no can only have one parent okay

385
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:28,480
so this is the band this is a tree

386
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,600
this is a tree

387
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,839
okay so

388
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,160
this is a tree a nose can only have one

389
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,920
parent right

390
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,000
yeah the nose can only have one parent

391
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,000
if an i don't know comes in

392
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,560
another comes in this is invalid this is

393
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,480
not a tree right it's a graph actually

394
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,399
uh so we want to find we want to find

395
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,079
out this this kind of thing so we use

396
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,880
the in degree

397
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:52,000
yeah in degree in degree let's say in i

398
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,199
and d

399
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,320
equals default dictionary int right so

400
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,320
we just do this here

401
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:05,679
so left okay so if left i know equals

402
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:09,360
one and theta the in degree

403
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:11,919
in degree left i plus equal one

404
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:14,000
then we have to check if this is bigger

405
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,559
than one will return false

406
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,600
and at the end if all these test paths

407
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,880
now will return true okay

408
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,600
yeah

409
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,640
so to sum up to sum up how do we check

410
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:29,039
if this is uh uh how do we check if this

411
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,280
is a tree okay let's just forget about

412
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:34,559
coding let's just walk through the

413
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,760
example a few examples okay and then we

414
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,559
find out

415
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,480
uh

416
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:41,360
okay not return true actually it needs

417
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,400
to return the size needs to be one yeah

418
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,600
because

419
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,559
only one component right yeah look

420
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,480
okay

421
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,520
uh

422
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,720
one

423
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,679
two

424
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,840
three four okay this is not true yeah

425
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,559
look it's disconnected

426
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,760
yeah how do we use this the ts

427
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:02,559
at the beginning

428
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,919
one to two yes so one and two merge to

429
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,280
one one

430
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,799
three and four

431
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,840
merge to one

432
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:11,360
how many

433
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:13,200
how many how many uh size when the ds

434
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,640
dot the size they will return two

435
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,720
because there are two groups right

436
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,559
everywhere look

437
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,400
it's not equal one they return four how

438
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,600
about this one

439
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,200
one

440
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,160
two

441
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,080
three

442
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:30,080
four okay essentially there's a cycle

443
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:33,919
look one two three yeah so one to two

444
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:35,760
so i have one two three here there we go

445
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,120
one to two

446
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,320
so these two

447
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,000
same group

448
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,720
two and three

449
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,440
okay i include one more one yeah look

450
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,760
three and one look three and one already

451
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,960
in one group so we do ten four right

452
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,400
here

453
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,760
and how about this these cases one

454
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,799
two

455
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,799
three

456
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:59,440
okay look

457
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:02,000
here this one yeah the last example yeah

458
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,120
this is one this one

459
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,039
this one

460
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,600
one two three

461
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:10,799
one two two

462
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,600
three two it's okay but but it violates

463
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,919
the

464
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:16,160
in degree because in degree two has more

465
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,080
than one right it means he has two point

466
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:21,280
parents that's not right

467
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:23,679
okay so the second one yeah so basically

468
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:26,400
this disjoint set

469
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:29,360
can this join set has to

470
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:32,240
find out if laser cycle is very good

471
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:34,000
helps to find out if it's disjoint

472
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,240
if it is connected because with at the

473
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,600
end we will find out if t is the size if

474
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,840
it equals one

475
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:43,039
but for the least cases

476
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:45,120
we need to use the in degree right a

477
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:47,600
parent a

478
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:50,799
note a no in a tree cannot have more

479
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,720
than one parent okay

480
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:54,880
a note in a tree

481
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:58,160
there's a no in a tree that does not

482
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,160
have any parent why is it

483
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,919
where are you listening where them to

484
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,840
jump how many kids i mean the kids the

485
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:08,240
the note the witch does not have organic

486
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,480
kids what do we call them

487
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,240
exactly okay yeah

488
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,700
for today bye

489
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,769
bye bye
