x y y z z
yeah you see so each letter in alphabet

54
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:47,840
yeah you see so each letter in alphabet
 

55
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,389
yeah you see so each letter in alphabet
appears

56
00:01:48,389 --> 00:01:48,399
appears
 

57
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,789
appears
at least once okay it can appear more

58
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:50,799
at least once okay it can appear more
 

59
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,710
at least once okay it can appear more
than once but it at least it needs to

60
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:52,720
than once but it at least it needs to
 

61
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,350
than once but it at least it needs to
appear once

62
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:53,360
appear once
 

63
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,350
appear once
so this sentence is a penguin

64
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:57,360
so this sentence is a penguin
 

65
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,149
so this sentence is a penguin
doesn't make sense okay so our class is

66
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:00,159
doesn't make sense okay so our class is
 

67
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,149
doesn't make sense okay so our class is
like giving a string a sentence this

68
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:02,159
like giving a string a sentence this
 

69
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,190
like giving a string a sentence this
might be we want to find out if it's a

70
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:05,200
might be we want to find out if it's a
 

71
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,550
might be we want to find out if it's a
penguin okay

72
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:06,560
penguin okay
 

73
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,749
penguin okay
any ideas oh we just check

74
00:02:09,749 --> 00:02:09,759
any ideas oh we just check
 

75
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,790
any ideas oh we just check
if there's a a and this is a b

76
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:12,800
if there's a a and this is a b
 

77
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,670
if there's a a and this is a b
and if there's a c and if there's a d

78
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:15,680
and if there's a c and if there's a d
 

79
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,550
and if there's a c and if there's a d
and it does

80
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:16,560
and it does
 

81
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,430
and it does
oh no one level one

82
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:21,440
oh no one level one
 

83
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,790
oh no one level one
no work no work okay so we can

84
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:24,800
no work no work okay so we can
 

85
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,750
no work no work okay so we can
as you can see see we can do this yeah

86
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:27,760
as you can see see we can do this yeah
 

87
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,309
as you can see see we can do this yeah
so

88
00:02:28,309 --> 00:02:28,319
so
 

89
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,350
so
how let's do this okay

90
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:31,360
how let's do this okay
 

91
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,270
how let's do this okay
define check okay that's a sentence okay

92
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:35,280
define check okay that's a sentence okay
 

93
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,030
define check okay that's a sentence okay
so you're saying that

94
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:37,040
so you're saying that
 

95
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,550
so you're saying that
for in our current character is

96
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:40,560
for in our current character is
 

97
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,350
for in our current character is
in in you just do this a

98
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:45,360
in in you just do this a
 

99
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,790
in in you just do this a
b and here here z yeah you write it that

100
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:48,800
b and here here z yeah you write it that
 

101
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,190
b and here here z yeah you write it that
way

102
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:49,200
way
 

103
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,710
way
yeah and then if if not

104
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:52,720
yeah and then if if not
 

105
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,070
yeah and then if if not
alright not c in s right

106
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:56,080
alright not c in s right
 

107
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,710
alright not c in s right
return

108
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:00,720

 

109
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,350

and if we all check it abcd to z and

110
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:03,360
and if we all check it abcd to z and
 

111
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,589
and if we all check it abcd to z and
then we return true right

112
00:03:05,589 --> 00:03:05,599
then we return true right
 

113
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,229
then we return true right
number one right yeah know what what's

114
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:08,239
number one right yeah know what what's
 

115
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:13,670
number one right yeah know what what's
the time capacity

116
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:13,680

 

117
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,990

what's the complexity of checking a

118
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,000
what's the complexity of checking a
 

119
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,550
what's the complexity of checking a
letter in that o

120
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:18,560
letter in that o
 

121
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,149
letter in that o
one o n o n come on because my n

122
00:03:22,149 --> 00:03:22,159
one o n o n come on because my n
 

123
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,270
one o n o n come on because my n
o n and then you what you want to check

124
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:25,280
o n and then you what you want to check
 

125
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,309
o n and then you what you want to check
26 times so it's all 26 times n

126
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:28,319
26 times so it's all 26 times n
 

127
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,070
26 times so it's all 26 times n
okay yeah that's pretty slow

128
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:32,080
okay yeah that's pretty slow
 

129
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,869
okay yeah that's pretty slow
because you're 26 times right yeah it's

130
00:03:34,869 --> 00:03:34,879
because you're 26 times right yeah it's
 

131
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:35,910
because you're 26 times right yeah it's
36 seconds

132
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:35,920
36 seconds
 

133
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,110
36 seconds
stop doing that okay yours is wet yeah i

134
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:39,120
stop doing that okay yours is wet yeah i
 

135
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,830
stop doing that okay yours is wet yeah i
know

136
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:39,840
know
 

137
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,869
know
okay so one

138
00:03:42,869 --> 00:03:42,879
okay so one
 

139
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,830
okay so one
one way of simplifying this is that you

140
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:45,840
one way of simplifying this is that you
 

141
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,550
one way of simplifying this is that you
know this c

142
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:46,560
know this c
 

143
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,030
know this c
is if you don't like this you write

144
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,040
is if you don't like this you write
 

145
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,710
is if you don't like this you write
range

146
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:50,720
range
 

147
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,990
range
26 yeah and then 8 is that

148
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,000
26 yeah and then 8 is that
 

149
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,229
26 yeah and then 8 is that
okay then this letter let's say a then

150
00:03:56,229 --> 00:03:56,239
okay then this letter let's say a then
 

151
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:57,350
okay then this letter let's say a then
you say what's a

152
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:57,360
you say what's a
 

153
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,390
you say what's a
a equals remember this this chr what's

154
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:00,400
a equals remember this this chr what's
 

155
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:00,949
a equals remember this this chr what's
the

156
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:00,959
the
 

157
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,429
the
lowercase letter of the ascii of the

158
00:04:05,429 --> 00:04:05,439
lowercase letter of the ascii of the
 

159
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,990
lowercase letter of the ascii of the
lowercase 48 that's zero

160
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:10,000
lowercase 48 that's zero
 

161
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,149
lowercase 48 that's zero
48 is zero 65. so yeah

162
00:04:14,149 --> 00:04:14,159
48 is zero 65. so yeah
 

163
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,509
48 is zero 65. so yeah
no 65 is uppercase 97 is lowercase

164
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:17,519
no 65 is uppercase 97 is lowercase
 

165
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,670
no 65 is uppercase 97 is lowercase
oh okay okay

166
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:21,680
oh okay okay
 

167
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,390
oh okay okay
if recent letter every sentence only

168
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:24,400
if recent letter every sentence only
 

169
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,790
if recent letter every sentence only
lowercase we talk about lowercase okay

170
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:26,800
lowercase we talk about lowercase okay
 

171
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,310
lowercase we talk about lowercase okay
okay chr 97 plus

172
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:30,320
okay chr 97 plus
 

173
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,150
okay chr 97 plus
c okay converting these two

174
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:34,160
c okay converting these two
 

175
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,590
c okay converting these two
c is from 0 to 26 right to 25 so

176
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:37,600
c is from 0 to 26 right to 25 so
 

177
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,870
c is from 0 to 26 right to 25 so
97 plus 6 6. now you can write it this

178
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:40,880
97 plus 6 6. now you can write it this
 

179
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,990
97 plus 6 6. now you can write it this
way so you don't need to write

180
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,000
way so you don't need to write
 

181
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,909
way so you don't need to write
abcd yeah the thing is checking a letter

182
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:45,919
abcd yeah the thing is checking a letter
 

183
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,030
abcd yeah the thing is checking a letter
in a string it takes o n n is the number

listen how about with you
 

201
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,310
listen how about with you
how about we use kind of data structure

202
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:10,320
how about we use kind of data structure
 

203
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,510
how about we use kind of data structure
all right

204
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:11,520
all right
 

205
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,270
all right
what kind of data structure can we use

206
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:13,280
what kind of data structure can we use
 

207
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:21,990
what kind of data structure can we use
set yes

208
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:22,000

00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:54,479
if i tell you if i tell you all the
 

227
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,029
if i tell you if i tell you all the
letters

228
00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:55,039
letters
 

229
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,590
letters
in the s is lowercase after this how

230
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:57,600
in the s is lowercase after this how
 

231
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,710
in the s is lowercase after this how
many letters

232
00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:58,720
many letters
 

233
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,710
many letters
are we looking for how many letters in

234
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:00,720
are we looking for how many letters in
 

235
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,309
are we looking for how many letters in
the set are we looking for

236
00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:02,319
the set are we looking for
 

237
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:19,590
the set are we looking for
if it's a penguin 26 okay so then we can

238
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:19,600

 

239
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,230

yeah let's see if this is the low case

240
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:22,240
yeah let's see if this is the low case
 

241
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,550
yeah let's see if this is the low case
yeah it's all a lowercase okay

242
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:24,560
yeah it's all a lowercase okay
 

243
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,270
yeah it's all a lowercase okay
yeah okay so

244
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:29,280
yeah okay so
 

245
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,270
yeah okay so
using the set we can also use what we

246
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:31,280
using the set we can also use what we
 

247
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,629
using the set we can also use what we
can also use this

248
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:32,639
can also use this
 

249
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,070
can also use this
called counter remember yeah c equals

250
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:36,080
called counter remember yeah c equals
 

251
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,510
called counter remember yeah c equals
counter we want to

252
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:37,520
counter we want to
 

253
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,390
counter we want to
check counter s right right therefore

254
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:42,400
check counter s right right therefore
 

255
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,870
check counter s right right therefore
i know we can all we can now check those

256
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:44,880
i know we can all we can now check those
 

257
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,430
i know we can all we can now check those
return

258
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:45,440
return
 

259
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,110
return
a return length c

260
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:49,120
a return length c
 

261
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,189
a return length c
equals one 26 yeah

262
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:53,199
equals one 26 yeah
 

263
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,550
equals one 26 yeah
if if there's s well

264
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:56,560
if if there's s well
 

265
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,710
if if there's s well
if s contains contains the space

266
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:00,720
if s contains contains the space
 

267
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,510
if s contains contains the space
uppercase lowercase this does not work

268
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:03,520
uppercase lowercase this does not work
 

269
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,430
uppercase lowercase this does not work
because we have that

270
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:05,440
because we have that
 

271
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,749
because we have that
it has more other characters yeah so how

272
00:07:07,749 --> 00:07:07,759
it has more other characters yeah so how
 

273
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:08,790
it has more other characters yeah so how
can we do this

274
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:08,800
can we do this
 

275
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,629
can we do this
we can do this every c and then we can

276
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:10,639
we can do this every c and then we can
 

277
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,990
we can do this every c and then we can
do this for

278
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:12,000
do this for
 

279
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,510
do this for
i in range

280
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:15,520
i in range
 

281
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,790
i in range
26 okay then we say

282
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:18,800
26 okay then we say
 

283
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,830
26 okay then we say
if ch if

284
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:21,840
if ch if
 

285
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,790
if ch if
okay what if uh

286
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:26,800

i plus 97 in
 

291
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,950
i plus 97 in
c right then return what

292
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:38,960
c right then return what
 

293
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:46,550
c right then return what
if you return five yeah return tree

294
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:46,560

 

295
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,029

yeah we are checking every letters yeah

296
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:49,039
yeah we are checking every letters yeah
 

297
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,550
yeah we are checking every letters yeah
that will work as well right

298
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:50,560
that will work as well right
 

299
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,029
that will work as well right
yeah what's the time complexity of this

300
00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:53,039
yeah what's the time complexity of this
 

301
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:53,990
yeah what's the time complexity of this
one right

302
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:54,000
one right
 

303
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:08,390
one right
what do you say oh

304
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:08,400

 

305
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:15,110

this is 26 this is one

306
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:15,120

 

307
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,830

okay 26 plus n right so actually you can

308
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:17,840
okay 26 plus n right so actually you can
 

309
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,430
okay 26 plus n right so actually you can
drop the constant oh n

310
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:19,440
drop the constant oh n
 

311
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,749
drop the constant oh n
because the most time consuming part is

312
00:08:21,749 --> 00:08:21,759
because the most time consuming part is
 

313
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,629
because the most time consuming part is
this b

314
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:22,639
this b
 

315
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,510
this b
the space complexity is our that's what

316
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:25,520
the space complexity is our that's what
 

317
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,390
the space complexity is our that's what
i said

318
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:26,400
i said
 

319
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,230
i said
first okay what's the terms what's the

320
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:28,240
first okay what's the terms what's the
 

321
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,790
first okay what's the terms what's the
space complexity

322
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:30,800
space complexity
 

323
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,949
space complexity
what's the space complexity

324
00:08:34,949 --> 00:08:34,959

 

325
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:38,829

we are using one what are we using

326
00:08:38,829 --> 00:08:38,839
we are using one what are we using
 

327
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,750
we are using one what are we using
uh what's that the counter yeah without

328
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:41,760
uh what's that the counter yeah without
 

329
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,029
uh what's that the counter yeah without
accept

330

00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:50,000
you're gonna rub it out uh
 

335
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,430
you're gonna rub it out uh
no no no what's the ask ascii

336
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:53,440
