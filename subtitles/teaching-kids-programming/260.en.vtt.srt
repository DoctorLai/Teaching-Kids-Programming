if a square
if it's a square if the side is one

20
00:00:27,189 --> 00:00:27,199
if it's a square if the side is one
 

21
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:28,630
if it's a square if the side is one
what's the perimeter

22
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:28,640
what's the perimeter

00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:39,440
so what's this
 

27
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,190
so what's this
if it's side of one

28
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:41,200
if it's side of one
 

29
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,510
if it's side of one
what's this parameter how much is the

30
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:43,520
what's this parameter how much is the
 

31
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,069
what's this parameter how much is the
perimeter of a square which size of one

32
00:00:48,069 --> 00:00:48,079
perimeter of a square which size of one
 

33
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,750
perimeter of a square which size of one
um

34
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:49,760
um
 

35
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,029
um
four yeah

36
00:00:51,029 --> 00:00:51,039
four yeah
 

37
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,510
four yeah
four one times four equals four yeah

38
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:53,520
four one times four equals four yeah
 

39
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,350
four one times four equals four yeah
because we have four sides two times

40
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:55,360
because we have four sides two times
 

41
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,270
because we have four sides two times
four okay how about if i give you

42
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:57,280
four okay how about if i give you
 

43
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,069

59
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,749

so what's mean what's the terminator of

60
00:01:49,749 --> 00:01:49,759
so what's mean what's the terminator of
 

61
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,990
so what's mean what's the terminator of
the what's the perimeter parameter of

sorry
 

67
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,870
sorry
you don't have to count so how do you

68
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:04,880
you don't have to count so how do you
 

69
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,630
you don't have to count so how do you
get a number

70
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:06,640
get a number
 

71
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,670
get a number
six with this you count you count

72
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:11,680

 

73
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,070

oh can you do this two

74
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:14,080
oh can you do this two
 

75
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,390
oh can you do this two
look

76
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:16,400

 

77
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,750

one square contribute four right so

78
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:19,760
one square contribute four right so
 

79
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,869
one square contribute four right so
actually it should be two times four but

80
00:02:22,869 --> 00:02:22,879
actually it should be two times four but
 

81
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,270
actually it should be two times four but
we want to subtract

82
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:25,280
we want to subtract
 

83
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,949
we want to subtract
we want to subtract this meter

84
00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:26,959
we want to subtract this meter
 

85
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,949
we want to subtract this meter
connection right so how many numbers

86
00:02:30,949 --> 00:02:30,959
connection right so how many numbers
 

87
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,750
connection right so how many numbers
two blocks so how many edges how many

88
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:33,760
two blocks so how many edges how many
 

89
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,509
two blocks so how many edges how many
two we need to subtract two so that's

90
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:35,519
two we need to subtract two so that's
 

91
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,470
two we need to subtract two so that's
six okay another example

92
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:40,480

 

93
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,110

number block three

95
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,070
number block three
what's the meter eight

96
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:46,080
what's the meter eight
 

97
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,630
what's the meter eight
eight yeah how do you get it because i

98
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:48,640
eight yeah how do you get it because i
 

99
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,750
eight yeah how do you get it because i
just know yeah three times four

100
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:51,760
just know yeah three times four
 

101
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,630
just know yeah three times four
and i need to stop trying

102
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:56,640

 

103
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,910

so so so far what you will get if there
 

119
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,750
so so so far what you will get if there
are connections if if i i added here a

120
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:23,760
are connections if if i i added here a
 

121
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,949
are connections if if i i added here a
square and if there's something here

122
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:26,959
square and if there's something here
 

123
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:27,750
square and if there's something here
and

124
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:27,760
and
 

125
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,270
and
uh okay if they are square here and then

126
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:31,280
uh okay if they are square here and then
 

127
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,830
uh okay if they are square here and then
i need to subtract two right if i add

128
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:33,840
i need to subtract two right if i add
 

129
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,990
i need to subtract two right if i add
another square here i need to subtract

that's um
 

205
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,830
that's um
eight

206
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:15,840
eight
 

207
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,150
eight
eight plus four yeah yeah okay so how do

208
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:18,160
eight plus four yeah yeah okay so how do
 

209
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,070
eight plus four yeah yeah okay so how do
we do this computing uh how do we

210
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:20,080
we do this computing uh how do we
 

211
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,230
we do this computing uh how do we
calculate with the algorithm on the

212
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:22,240
calculate with the algorithm on the
 

213
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,950
calculate with the algorithm on the
computer so i can count how many squares

214
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:24,960
computer so i can count how many squares
 

215
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,189
computer so i can count how many squares
right one two three four four square

216
00:05:27,189 --> 00:05:27,199
right one two three four four square
 

217
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,150
right one two three four four square
four times four but i need to subtract

218
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:30,160
four times four but i need to subtract
 

219
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,310
four times four but i need to subtract
the comma edges which is here two

220
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:34,320
the comma edges which is here two
 

221
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,629
the comma edges which is here two
four four that's the other four yeah and

222
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:36,639
four four that's the other four yeah and
 

223
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,070
four four that's the other four yeah and
that these two doesn't have any

224
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,080
that these two doesn't have any
 

225
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,790
that these two doesn't have any
combination so that was that 16 minus

226
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:40,800
combination so that was that 16 minus
 

227
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,510
combination so that was that 16 minus
four equals square got it

228
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:43,520
four equals square got it
 

229
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,029
four equals square got it
easy yeah

230
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:45,039
easy yeah
