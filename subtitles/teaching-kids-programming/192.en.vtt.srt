00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,230
go hello mr mr ryan how are you today
good okay consider this a

4
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:08,240
good okay consider this a
 

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,589
good okay consider this a
b c d e

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,590
f g h i j a
zero one two three four

10
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:19,600
zero one two three four
 

11
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,470
zero one two three four
five six seven eight nine okay so this

12
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:22,480
five six seven eight nine okay so this
 

13
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,390
five six seven eight nine okay so this
mapping for the first

14
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:24,400
mapping for the first
 

15
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,830
mapping for the first
ten letters in alphabet we have

16
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:27,840
ten letters in alphabet we have
 

17
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,630
ten letters in alphabet we have
mapping to zero okay and then look if

18
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:30,640
mapping to zero okay and then look if
 

19
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,269
mapping to zero okay and then look if
this is

20
00:00:31,269 --> 00:00:31,279
this is
 

21
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,630
this is
a c b

22
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:34,640
a c b
 

23
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,910
a c b
so you'll be become zero two

24
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:37,920
so you'll be become zero two
 

25
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,389
so you'll be become zero two
one right okay one

26
00:00:42,389 --> 00:00:42,399
one right okay one
 

27
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,869
one right okay one
c b a what's that

28
00:00:46,869 --> 00:00:46,879
c b a what's that
 

29
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,229
c b a what's that
two one zero if you pass this together

30
00:00:50,229 --> 00:00:50,239
two one zero if you pass this together
 

31
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,670
two one zero if you pass this together
that'll be two hundred

32
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:53,680
that'll be two hundred
 

33
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,590
that'll be two hundred
and thirty one yeah and what's that 231

34
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:57,600
and thirty one yeah and what's that 231
 

35
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,990
and thirty one yeah and what's that 231
is

36
00:00:58,990 --> 00:00:59,000
is
 

37
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,069
is
cbd cbd

38
00:01:02,069 --> 00:01:02,079
cbd cbd
 

39
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,710
cbd cbd
so today's task is very easy given two

40
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:04,720
so today's task is very easy given two
 

41
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,070
so today's task is very easy given two
words

42
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:06,080
words
 

43
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,270
words
first word second was

44
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:09,280
first word second was
 

45
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,109
first word second was
three words you need to tell me if they

46
00:01:11,109 --> 00:01:11,119
three words you need to tell me if they
 

47
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,990
three words you need to tell me if they
added together is the same

48
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:14,000
added together is the same
 

49
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,590
added together is the same
all right then you need to tell me true

50
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:15,600
all right then you need to tell me true
 

51
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,310
all right then you need to tell me true
okay because you

52
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:18,320
okay because you
 

53
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,350
okay because you
give me acb and cba

54
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:21,360
give me acb and cba
 

55
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,749
give me acb and cba
and cbd and you need to tell me yes

56
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:23,759
and cbd and you need to tell me yes
 

57
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,510
and cbd and you need to tell me yes
because acb plus cba

58
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:25,520
because acb plus cba
 

59
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,550
because acb plus cba
equals cbt according to lease

60
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:28,560
equals cbt according to lease
 

61
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,990
equals cbt according to lease
correct are we here

62
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:32,000
correct are we here
 

63
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,190
correct are we here
yeah okay any idea

64
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:35,200
yeah okay any idea
 

65
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,910
yeah okay any idea
thing yeah how are we improving every

66
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:37,920
thing yeah how are we improving every
 

67
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,230
thing yeah how are we improving every
possibility what possibilities

68
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:40,240
possibility what possibilities
 

69
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,910
possibility what possibilities
well there's only one possibility it's

70
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:41,920
well there's only one possibility it's
 

71
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,910
well there's only one possibility it's
not performing yeah it's just

72
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:43,920
not performing yeah it's just
 

73
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,350
not performing yeah it's just
okay straight forward yeah you figure

74
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:47,360
okay straight forward yeah you figure
 

75
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,389
okay straight forward yeah you figure
out this one

76
00:01:48,389 --> 00:01:48,399
out this one
 

77
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,190
out this one
you figure out this one and then you sum

78
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:51,200
you figure out this one and then you sum
 

79
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,230
you figure out this one and then you sum
up them

80
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:52,240
up them
 

81
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,749
up them
and see if

82
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:55,759

 

83
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,910

okay so we need the functions to convert

84
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:57,920
okay so we need the functions to convert
 

85
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,510
okay so we need the functions to convert
these to this right

86
00:01:59,510 --> 00:01:59,520
these to this right
 

87
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,789
these to this right
yes if this is function f if

88
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:02,799
yes if this is function f if
 

89
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,069
yes if this is function f if
if f a c b

90
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:06,079
if f a c b
 

91
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,070
if f a c b
if it is a function f acp you can tell

92
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:08,080
if it is a function f acp you can tell
 

93
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,469
if it is a function f acp you can tell
me if it's 0 21

94
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:10,479
me if it's 0 21
 

95
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,670
me if it's 0 21
right then i can say f this is if

96
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:13,680
right then i can say f this is if
 

97
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,229
right then i can say f this is if
a this is b this c and i can say i can

98
00:02:16,229 --> 00:02:16,239
a this is b this c and i can say i can
 

99
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:17,510
a this is b this c and i can say i can
check f a

100
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:17,520
check f a
 

101
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,670
check f a
plus f b is equals to f c right

102
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:21,680
plus f b is equals to f c right
 

103
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,869
plus f b is equals to f c right
easy pc yeah so the most important

104
00:02:24,869 --> 00:02:24,879
easy pc yeah so the most important
 

105
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,910
easy pc yeah so the most important
thing is this f function right right

106
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:27,920
thing is this f function right right
 

107
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,350
thing is this f function right right
so how can we implement this function

108
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:31,360
so how can we implement this function
 

109
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,910
so how can we implement this function
bottom up what bottom what's out of

110
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:33,920
bottom up what bottom what's out of
 

111
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,070
bottom up what bottom what's out of
bottom remember how do we convert these

112
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:36,080
bottom remember how do we convert these
 

113
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,670
bottom remember how do we convert these
the numbers to the

114
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:39,680
the numbers to the
 

115
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,110
the numbers to the
binary to remember no no no no

116
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:43,120
binary to remember no no no no
 

117
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,630
binary to remember no no no no
no remember this one one one one one in

118
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:46,640
no remember this one one one one one in
 

119
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,830
no remember this one one one one one in
binary is what

120
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:48,840
binary is what
 

121
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,150
binary is what
how and how are we converting

122
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:52,160
how and how are we converting
 

123
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,190
how and how are we converting
111 to 15. one

124
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:55,200
111 to 15. one
 

125
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,309
111 to 15. one
two four eight exactly so every time we

126
00:02:58,309 --> 00:02:58,319
two four eight exactly so every time we
 

127
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,390
two four eight exactly so every time we
comes two plus the

128
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:00,400
comes two plus the
 

129
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,350
comes two plus the
yeah so for example one times two and if

130
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:03,360
yeah so for example one times two and if
 

131
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,750
yeah so for example one times two and if
it's zero we skip it

132
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:05,760
it's zero we skip it
 

133
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,470
it's zero we skip it
yeah so so look at it so how do we

134
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:08,480
yeah so so look at it so how do we
 

135
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,470
yeah so so look at it so how do we
calculate one two three in decimal is

136
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:10,480
calculate one two three in decimal is
 

137
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,149
calculate one two three in decimal is
like one

138
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:12,159
like one
 

139
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,790
like one
and then here is one times ten plus two

140
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:14,800
and then here is one times ten plus two
 

141
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,190
and then here is one times ten plus two
okay

142
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:15,200
okay
 

143
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,589
okay
then the note becomes 12. and then 12

144
00:03:17,589 --> 00:03:17,599
then the note becomes 12. and then 12
 

145
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,750
then the note becomes 12. and then 12
plus 10 times 10 plus 3

146
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:19,760
plus 10 times 10 plus 3
 

147
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,670
plus 10 times 10 plus 3
equals 123 exactly so yeah

148
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:23,680
equals 123 exactly so yeah
 

149
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,830
equals 123 exactly so yeah
so if we know the mapping which is times

150
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:25,840
so if we know the mapping which is times
 

151
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,350
so if we know the mapping which is times
10 plus

152
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:27,360
10 plus
 

153
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,030
10 plus
it's the same yeah we the only

154
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:29,040
it's the same yeah we the only
 

155
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,550
it's the same yeah we the only
difference is that we need to convert

156
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:30,560
difference is that we need to convert
 

157
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,470
difference is that we need to convert
this a

158
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:32,480
this a
 

159
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,910
this a
to zero b to one c to two right

160
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:35,920
to zero b to one c to two right
 

161
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:42,390
to zero b to one c to two right
okay yeah this is one way of doing okay

162
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:42,400

 

163
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,589

so let's implement this function define

164
00:03:45,589 --> 00:03:45,599
so let's implement this function define
 

165
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,110
so let's implement this function define
f s f column

166
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:49,120
f s f column
 

167
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,390
f s f column
so let's say answer equals zero

168
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:52,400
so let's say answer equals zero
 

169
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,910
so let's say answer equals zero
right that's the beginning yeah

170
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:53,920
right that's the beginning yeah
 

171
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,309
right that's the beginning yeah
therefore we want to go through how do

172
00:03:56,309 --> 00:03:56,319
therefore we want to go through how do
 

173
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,910
therefore we want to go through how do
we go through this number in

174
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:57,920
we go through this number in
 

175
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,190
we go through this number in
s for i in s

176
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:01,200
s for i in s
 

177
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,710
s for i in s
right right now i is the character a

178
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:04,720
right right now i is the character a
 

179
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,309
right right now i is the character a
a b c this kind of thing

180
00:04:08,309 --> 00:04:08,319

 

181
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,509

and if we want to convert it to 0

182
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:11,519
and if we want to convert it to 0
 

183
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,789
and if we want to convert it to 0
what we can get what can we do

184
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:14,799
what we can get what can we do
 

185
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,909
what we can get what can we do
we can have this if if i equals a

186
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:17,919
we can have this if if i equals a
 

187
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,270
we can have this if if i equals a
then then answer

188
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:21,280
then then answer
 

189
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,870
then then answer
times answer plus 10 times 10 plus

190
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:24,880
times answer plus 10 times 10 plus
 

191
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,310
times answer plus 10 times 10 plus
a plus zero but now you need to have

192
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:28,320
a plus zero but now you need to have
 

193
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,510
a plus zero but now you need to have
10 if so look remember long

i just need to return what it cannot
 

263
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,510
i just need to return what it cannot
yeah what's the time complexity

264
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:35,520
yeah what's the time complexity
 

265
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,029
yeah what's the time complexity
what's the space complexity

266

if i want to convert one to three string
into an integer one two three oh how can

334
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:15,039
into an integer one two three oh how can
 

335
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:15,430
into an integer one two three oh how can
i

336
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:15,440
i
 

337
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,629
i
impress them in

338
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:18,639
impress them in
 

339
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,230
impress them in
no no no integer right

340
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:22,240
no no no integer right
 

341
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,670
no no no integer right
and then n and because this is one

342
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:25,680
and then n and because this is one
 

343
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,550
and then n and because this is one
string rook eric marking yeah and

344
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:28,560
string rook eric marking yeah and
 

345
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,270
string rook eric marking yeah and
mapping

346
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:29,280
mapping
 

347
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,870
mapping
eric what this making what is it

348
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:34,880

 

349
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,909

i mean what's the inside what this key

350
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:37,919
i mean what's the inside what this key
 

351
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,110
i mean what's the inside what this key
value pair what's that

352
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:39,120
value pair what's that
 

353
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,230
value pair what's that
dictionary right dictionary and unless i

354
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:42,240
dictionary right dictionary and unless i
 

355
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,590
dictionary right dictionary and unless i
is the key and mi what does it return

356
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:45,600
is the key and mi what does it return
 

357
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,630
is the key and mi what does it return
if i is a what is the difference zero

358
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:48,640
if i is a what is the difference zero
 

359
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,550
if i is a what is the difference zero
zero okay and then add all these

360
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:50,560
zero okay and then add all these
 

361
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,670
zero okay and then add all these
together so

362
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:51,680
together so
 

363
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,710
together so
if it's uh if it's a c then it will be

364
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:54,720
if it's uh if it's a c then it will be
 

365
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,790
if it's uh if it's a c then it will be
clo 2 1 right then it will be 0 to 1

366
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:58,800
clo 2 1 right then it will be 0 to 1
 

367
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,190
clo 2 1 right then it will be 0 to 1
right this l will be 0 to 1 and convert

368
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:01,200
right this l will be 0 to 1 and convert
 

369
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,190
right this l will be 0 to 1 and convert
to in that will be 21

370
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:03,200
to in that will be 21
 

371
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,310
to in that will be 21
right okay yeah so

372
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:06,320
right okay yeah so
 

373
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,509
right okay yeah so
what's the time complexity for this one

374
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:11,519

 

375
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,750

yeah what's the space complexity

376
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:15,760

 

377
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,550

and why someone

378
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:20,560

 

379
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:29,670

i'm thinking

380
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:29,680

 

381
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,670

this is the additional array alright

382
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:31,680
this is the additional array alright
 

383
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,150
this is the additional array alright
this could grow this is the same size as

384
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:34,160
this could grow this is the same size as
 

385
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,949
this could grow this is the same size as
right right so it's all n right now

386
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:36,959
right right so it's all n right now
 

387
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,030
right right so it's all n right now
previously that one does not why why is

388
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,040
previously that one does not why why is
 

389
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,110
previously that one does not why why is
that because it's a number

390
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:41,120
that because it's a number
 

391
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,030
that because it's a number
right we're converting to the number

392
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,040
right we're converting to the number
 

393
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,870
right we're converting to the number
only right got it

394
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:44,880
only right got it
 

395
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,910
only right got it
yeah that times 10 plus that thing yeah

396
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:47,920
yeah that times 10 plus that thing yeah
 

397
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,470
yeah that times 10 plus that thing yeah
correct does it make sense yeah

398
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:52,480
correct does it make sense yeah
 

399
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,829
correct does it make sense yeah

403
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,829

and equals is something about

404
00:10:02,829 --> 00:10:02,839
and equals is something about
 

405
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:08,630
and equals is something about
um okay

406
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:08,640

 

407
