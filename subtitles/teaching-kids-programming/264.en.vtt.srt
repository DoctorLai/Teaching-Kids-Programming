c b okay
so

116
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:24,640
so
 

117
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,110
so
we want to look for the substrings

118
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:27,120
we want to look for the substrings
 

119
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,949
we want to look for the substrings
in s1 let's have the let's ah

120
00:02:30,949 --> 00:02:30,959
in s1 let's have the let's ah
 

121
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,070
in s1 let's have the let's ah
let our anagram with s0 okay so what are

122
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:34,080
let our anagram with s0 okay so what are
 

123
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,470
let our anagram with s0 okay so what are
those in this case all right look

124
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:36,480
those in this case all right look
 

125
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,589
those in this case all right look
abc

126
00:02:37,589 --> 00:02:37,599
abc
 

127
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,589
abc
what are the abc in can you find the

128
00:02:39,589 --> 00:02:39,599
what are the abc in can you find the
 

129
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,229
what are the abc in can you find the
substring in s1 which is the anagram in

130
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:42,239
substring in s1 which is the anagram in
 

131
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:49,350
substring in s1 which is the anagram in
stl

132

133
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,670

and um yeah

134
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:51,680
and um yeah
 

135
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,790
and um yeah
okay so you got it right so look bac abc

136
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:54,800
okay so you got it right so look bac abc
 

137
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,070
okay so you got it right so look bac abc
acb is okay so yeah so we return number

138
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:58,080
acb is okay so yeah so we return number
 

139
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,070
acb is okay so yeah so we return number
three easy

140
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,080
three easy
 

141
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,910
three easy
yeah yeah there's atp and another acb

142
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:03,920
yeah yeah there's atp and another acb
 

143
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,070
yeah yeah there's atp and another acb
yeah that acv yes exactly but they

144
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:06,080
yeah that acv yes exactly but they
 

145
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,750
yeah that acv yes exactly but they
consider the difference so there are

146
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:07,760
consider the difference so there are
 

147
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,229
consider the difference so there are
different substrings right this acp acp

148
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:10,239
different substrings right this acp acp
 

149
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,309
different substrings right this acp acp
they are both

150
00:03:12,309 --> 00:03:12,319
they are both
 

151
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,190
they are both
the energon with s0 okay got it

152
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:15,200
the energon with s0 okay got it
 

153
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,509
the energon with s0 okay got it
so this is the problem man yeah so how

154
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:17,519
so this is the problem man yeah so how
 

155
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,430
so this is the problem man yeah so how
can we do this

156
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:19,440
can we do this
 

157
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,030
can we do this
so how do we check if the two strings

158
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:21,040
so how do we check if the two strings
 

159
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,589
so how do we check if the two strings
are underground if they are look if i

160
00:03:23,589 --> 00:03:23,599
are underground if they are look if i
 

161
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,390
are underground if they are look if i
give you s0 and s1 how do we check if

162
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:26,400
give you s0 and s1 how do we check if
 

163
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,990
give you s0 and s1 how do we check if
they are n

164
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:28,000
they are n
 

165
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,830
they are n
remember define

166
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:29,840
remember define
 

167
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,789
remember define
check engram

168
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:32,799

 

169
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,430

how do we check it remember

170
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:35,440
how do we check it remember
 

171
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,190
how do we check it remember
we talked about this before we want to

172
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:37,200
we talked about this before we want to
 

173
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,869
we talked about this before we want to
use we want to check the number of

174
00:03:38,869 --> 00:03:38,879
use we want to check the number of
 

175
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,470
use we want to check the number of
characters and

176
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:40,480
characters and
 

177
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,309
characters and
and their appearance the number of

178
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:42,319
and their appearance the number of
 

179
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,149
and their appearance the number of
frequencies are the same and we can use

180
00:03:44,149 --> 00:03:44,159
frequencies are the same and we can use
 

181
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,030
frequencies are the same and we can use
the

182
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,040
the
 

183
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,070
the
we need to count right we need to count

184
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:48,080
we need to count right we need to count
 

185
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,750
we need to count right we need to count
the

186
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:49,760
the
 

187
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,390
the
counter string so in person remember we

188
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:52,400
counter string so in person remember we
 

189
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,229
counter string so in person remember we
use what kind of

190
00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:54,239
use what kind of
 

191
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,750
use what kind of
how can we count it

192
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:55,760
how can we count it
 

193
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,229
how can we count it
hong kong county set

194
00:03:58,229 --> 00:03:58,239
hong kong county set
 

195
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,550
hong kong county set
yeah but we can use the much faster way

196
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:00,560
yeah but we can use the much faster way
 

197
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,350
yeah but we can use the much faster way
which is capital c

198
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:03,360
which is capital c
 

199
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,149
which is capital c
yeah

200
00:04:04,149 --> 00:04:04,159
yeah
 

201
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,789
yeah
so if this is easier return

202
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:06,799
so if this is easier return
 

203
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,949
so if this is easier return
counter

204
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:08,959
counter
 

205
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,869
counter
s zero

206
00:04:10,869 --> 00:04:10,879
s zero
 

207
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:22,550
s zero
equals equal what

208
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:22,560

 

209
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,950

to check if these two are energons okay

210
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:26,960
to check if these two are energons okay
 

211
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,590
to check if these two are energons okay
okay so now look because we know the

212
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:29,600
okay so now look because we know the
 

213
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,909
okay so now look because we know the
length of the s0 is three yeah we know

214
00:04:31,909 --> 00:04:31,919
length of the s0 is three yeah we know
 

215
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,790
length of the s0 is three yeah we know
this length so in s1

216
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:34,800
this length so in s1
 

217
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,430
this length so in s1
what are the what are the substring the

218
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:37,440
what are the what are the substring the
 

219
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,710
what are the what are the substring the
size

220
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:38,720
size
 

221
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,950
size
we want to look to check

222
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:42,960

 

223
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,110

we know right because we only we only

224
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:45,120
we know right because we only we only
 

225
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,590
we know right because we only we only
want to check the number uh

226
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:47,600
want to check the number uh
 

227
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,070
want to check the number uh
the the substring which are size have

228
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,080
the the substring which are size have
 

229
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,230
the the substring which are size have
the same size as still yeah so in this

230
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:52,240
the same size as still yeah so in this
 

231
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,150
the same size as still yeah so in this
case i check what plc because this is

232
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:54,160
case i check what plc because this is
 

233
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,790
case i check what plc because this is
the window of three and i move to next i

234
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:56,800
the window of three and i move to next i
 

235
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,310
the window of three and i move to next i
move to next every time i check the

236
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:58,320
move to next every time i check the
 

237
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,390
move to next every time i check the
substring of three yeah substitutionally

238
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:00,400
substring of three yeah substitutionally
 

239
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,830
substring of three yeah substitutionally
substring

240
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:01,840
substring
 

241
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,909
substring
subject and right yeah

242
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:03,919
subject and right yeah
 

243
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,070
subject and right yeah
so in this case we can check right so

244
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:06,080
so in this case we can check right so
 

245
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,790
so in this case we can check right so
how can we check so p a c we check okay

246
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:08,800
how can we check so p a c we check okay
 

247
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,390
how can we check so p a c we check okay
if it's that set we can use this one

248
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:10,400
if it's that set we can use this one
 

249
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,510
if it's that set we can use this one
right but when we move to the acp

250
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:13,520
right but when we move to the acp
 

251
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,430
right but when we move to the acp
we need to update this counter thing

252
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:15,440
we need to update this counter thing
 

253
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,350
we need to update this counter thing
yeah so how can we update it

254
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:17,360
yeah so how can we update it
 

255
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,670
yeah so how can we update it
when we move from bac

256
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:19,680
when we move from bac
 

257
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,469
when we move from bac
to

258
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:20,479
to
 

259
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,790
to
acb what should we do what should we do

260
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:22,800
acb what should we do what should we do
 

261
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,390
acb what should we do what should we do
with the counter one of the counter

262
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:24,400
with the counter one of the counter
 

263
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,150
with the counter one of the counter
because this counter never change uh

264
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:26,160
because this counter never change uh
 

265
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,870
because this counter never change uh
let's call the s0 never change right

266
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:28,880
let's call the s0 never change right
 

267
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,550
let's call the s0 never change right
this counter average but this is

268
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:30,560
this counter average but this is
 

269
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,110
this counter average but this is
changing call the s1 is changing of the

270
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:33,120
changing call the s1 is changing of the
 

271
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,990
changing call the s1 is changing of the
lead from phc to acb so what we need to

272
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,000
lead from phc to acb so what we need to
 

273
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,749
lead from phc to acb so what we need to
do is we remove the left mouse b look

274
00:05:39,749 --> 00:05:39,759
do is we remove the left mouse b look
 

275
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,670
do is we remove the left mouse b look
all right this is very important right

276
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:41,680
all right this is very important right
 

277
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,469
all right this is very important right
now we remove the f mouse b and then we

278
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:44,479
now we remove the f mouse b and then we
 

279
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,390
now we remove the f mouse b and then we
add the right most b

280
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:46,400
add the right most b
 

281
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,430
add the right most b
right b a c to h b will happen we don't

282
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:49,440
right b a c to h b will happen we don't
 

283
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,510
right b a c to h b will happen we don't
need this b right

284
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:51,520
need this b right
 

285
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,790
need this b right
and we added one more okay acb to to

286
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:54,800
and we added one more okay acb to to
 

287
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,710
and we added one more okay acb to to
move to next what do we do

288
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:56,720
move to next what do we do
 

289
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,390
move to next what do we do
what do we do

290
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:58,400
what do we do
 

291
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,230
what do we do
look array

292
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:00,240
look array
 

293
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,110
look array
we get rid of a we add d and then move

294
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:03,120
we get rid of a we add d and then move
 

295
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,270
we get rid of a we add d and then move
to next what do we do we get with the c

296
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:05,280
to next what do we do we get with the c
 

297
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,230
to next what do we do we get with the c
and we add e okay move to next we get

298
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:08,240
and we add e okay move to next we get
 

299
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,150
and we add e okay move to next we get
rid of b and we add a

300
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:10,160
rid of b and we add a
 

301
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,670
rid of b and we add a
move to next

302
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:11,680
move to next
 

303
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,629
move to next
we add a c and remove d move to next we

304
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:14,639
we add a c and remove d move to next we
 

305
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,430
we add a c and remove d move to next we
add b and remove e okay so we just need

306
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:17,440
add b and remove e okay so we just need
 

307
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,550
add b and remove e okay so we just need
to

308
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:18,560
to
 

309
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,469
to
update this counter along the way right

310
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:22,479
update this counter along the way right
 

311
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:23,350
update this counter along the way right
yeah

312
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:23,360
yeah
 

313
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,909
yeah
okay then we can do this okay

314
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:25,919
okay then we can do this okay
 

315
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,909
okay then we can do this okay
this this is called the sliding window

316
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:27,919
this this is called the sliding window
 

317
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,070
this this is called the sliding window
okay because we know the size of the

318
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:30,080
okay because we know the size of the
 

319
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,350
okay because we know the size of the
window is

320
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:31,360
window is
 

321
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,670
window is
what n0 equals length

322
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:33,680
what n0 equals length
 

323
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,230
what n0 equals length
as zero okay this is the size of sliding

324
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:36,240
as zero okay this is the size of sliding
 

325
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,150
as zero okay this is the size of sliding
window always the stacking window of

326
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:38,160
window always the stacking window of
 

327
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,350
window always the stacking window of
size and yellow no we attack move it

328
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:41,360
size and yellow no we attack move it
 

329
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,189
size and yellow no we attack move it
move it move okay

330
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:43,199
move it move okay
 

331
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,230
move it move okay

and one is the length and zero and zero

438
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:50,320
and one is the length and zero and zero
 

439
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,829
and one is the length and zero and zero
come on zero is this one

440
00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:52,839
come on zero is this one
 

441
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:54,710
come on zero is this one
yeah

442
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:54,720
yeah
 

443
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,509
yeah
okay and then if c equals current if abc

444
00:08:57,509 --> 00:08:57,519
okay and then if c equals current if abc
 

445
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,230
okay and then if c equals current if abc
and bac the counter is our anagram so

446
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:00,240
and bac the counter is our anagram so
 

447
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,829
and bac the counter is our anagram so
what should we do

448
00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:01,839
what should we do
 

449
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,269
what should we do
what should we do answer what

450
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:05,279
what should we do answer what
 

451
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,350
what should we do answer what
if this is the n comma at least the

452
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:07,360
if this is the n comma at least the
 

453
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,750
if this is the n comma at least the
first winner what should we do

454
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:09,760
first winner what should we do
 

455
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,949
first winner what should we do
um

456
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:10,959
um
 

457
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,430
um
plus one that's the plus one where that

458
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:13,440
plus one that's the plus one where that
 

459
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,230
plus one that's the plus one where that
yes that's what i mean yeah and then we

460
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:16,240
yes that's what i mean yeah and then we
 

461
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,990
yes that's what i mean yeah and then we
just need to move this

462
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:18,000
just need to move this
 

463
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,670
just need to move this
to the end right

464
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:19,680
to the end right
 

465
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,350
to the end right
so ah look r is the length as zero i is

466
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:23,360
so ah look r is the length as zero i is
 

467
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,269
so ah look r is the length as zero i is
at this point at three so zero one two

468
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:25,279
at this point at three so zero one two
 

469
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,710
at this point at three so zero one two
three i will be pointing to here right

470
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:28,720
three i will be pointing to here right
 

471
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,509
three i will be pointing to here right
i is the initial value so i'm here i

472
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:31,519
i is the initial value so i'm here i
 

473
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,269
i is the initial value so i'm here i
wanna move here ah yeah so what should

474
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:33,279
wanna move here ah yeah so what should
 

475
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,829
wanna move here ah yeah so what should
we do

476
00:09:34,829 --> 00:09:34,839
we do
 

477
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:36,389
we do
wire

478
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:36,399
wire
 

479
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,750
wire
ah is smaller than

480
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:39,760
ah is smaller than
 

481
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,550
ah is smaller than
an n zero all in one

482
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:42,560
an n zero all in one
 

483
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,269

489
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,230

okay so i need to update the window so

490
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:56,240
okay so i need to update the window so
 

491
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,790
okay so i need to update the window so
this is c current is the current window

492
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:58,800
this is c current is the current window
 

493
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,030
this is c current is the current window
so what should i do i just remove s i

494
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:01,040
so what should i do i just remove s i
 

495
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,630
so what should i do i just remove s i
should add the b right

496
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:02,640
should add the b right
 

497
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,269
should add the b right
look at it i should add the

498
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:05,279
look at it i should add the
 

499
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,870
look at it i should add the
these i should add these and remove

500
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:06,880

these i should add these and remove
these yeah i should remove this i should

502
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:08,800
these yeah i should remove this i should
 

503
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,630
these yeah i should remove this i should
at least right

504
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:10,640
at least right
 

505
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,949
at least right
look so what should we do

506
00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:12,959
look so what should we do
 

507
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:13,829
look so what should we do
uh

508
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:13,839
uh
 

509
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:31,110
uh
the current yeah current

510
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:31,120

 

511
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,230

this here

512
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:32,240
this here
 

513
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,829
this here
come on

514
00:10:33,829 --> 00:10:33,839
come on
 

515
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,670
come on
s1 what ah

516
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:37,680
s1 what ah
 

517
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,630
s1 what ah
if this is r what's this

518
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:40,640
if this is r what's this
 

519
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,350
if this is r what's this
this is r what's this

520
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:43,360
this is r what's this
 

521
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:50,710
this is r what's this
r minus one and zero and

522
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:50,720

 

523
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,150

minus three f

524
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:52,160
minus three f
 

525
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,230
minus three f
minus and zero

526
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:56,240

 

527
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,030

minus equals one right but if this is

528
00:10:59,030 --> 00:10:59,040
minus equals one right but if this is
 

529
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,110
minus equals one right but if this is
zero so what happened if this is yellow

530
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:01,120
zero so what happened if this is yellow
 

531
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,269
zero so what happened if this is yellow
we need to remove the key from the

532
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:03,279
we need to remove the key from the
 

533
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,230
we need to remove the key from the
decision area correct because when it

534
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:06,240
decision area correct because when it
 

535
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,150
decision area correct because when it
becomes zero what does this mean when a

536
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:08,160
becomes zero what does this mean when a
 

537
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,389
becomes zero what does this mean when a
a number of appearance becomes zero it

538
00:11:10,389 --> 00:11:10,399
a number of appearance becomes zero it
 

539
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,269
a number of appearance becomes zero it
means this this character is not

540
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:13,279
means this this character is not
 

541
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,790
means this this character is not
it's not existing you know we can't

542
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:14,800
it's not existing you know we can't
 

543
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,389
it's not existing you know we can't
window so we need to remove the key

544
00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:16,399
window so we need to remove the key
 

545
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,710
window so we need to remove the key
right so so e

546
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:18,720
right so so e
 

547
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,750
right so so e
is what

548
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:19,760
is what
 

549
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,430
is what
if current

550
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:21,440
if current
 

551
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,030

00:11:26,069 --> 00:11:26,079
r minus n0 come up
 

555
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,470
r minus n0 come up
equals 1 then we debate it we deleted a

556
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:28,480
equals 1 then we debate it we deleted a
 

557
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,150
equals 1 then we debate it we deleted a
key did it

558
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:30,160
key did it
 

559
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,389
key did it
it is current

560
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:32,399
it is current
 

561
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,710
it is current
s1 yeah s1

562
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:34,720
s1 yeah s1
 

563
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,590
s1 yeah s1
r minus n0

564
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:37,600
r minus n0
 

565
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,389
r minus n0
okay

566
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:38,399
okay
 

567
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,230
okay
right

568
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:40,240
right
 

569
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,870
right
and now what should we do if current

570
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:42,880
and now what should we do if current
 

571
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,509
and now what should we do if current
equals c what should we do

572
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:45,519
equals c what should we do
 

573
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,030
equals c what should we do
yeah

574
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,040
yeah
 

575
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,829
yeah
yeah if we if already update if we

576
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:49,839
yeah if we if already update if we
 

577
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,550
yeah if we if already update if we
already update it then we need to if we

578
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:52,560
already update it then we need to if we
 

579
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,389
already update it then we need to if we
already update the window and then we

580
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:54,399
already update the window and then we
 

581
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,230
already update the window and then we
find out the window is the same as this

582
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:56,240
find out the window is the same as this
 

583
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,710
find out the window is the same as this
window then we answer plus in person

584
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:58,720
window then we answer plus in person
 

585
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,910
window then we answer plus in person
all right

586
00:11:59,910 --> 00:11:59,920
all right
 

587
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,150
all right
and how do we go to the next loop how do

588
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:02,160
and how do we go to the next loop how do
 

589
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,790
and how do we go to the next loop how do
we go to the next loop by one

590
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:04,800
we go to the next loop by one
 

591
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,910
we go to the next loop by one
hour

592
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:07,920

 

593
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,389

plus equal one left move this window to

594
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:10,399
plus equal one left move this window to
 

595
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,310
plus equal one left move this window to
the next year after last one

596
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:12,320
the next year after last one
 

597
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,230
the next year after last one
and return a little bit

598
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:14,240
and return a little bit
 

599
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,310
and return a little bit
awesome return answer we're done okay

600
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:18,320
awesome return answer we're done okay
 

601
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,990
awesome return answer we're done okay
so does it make sense what's the time

602
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:20,000
so does it make sense what's the time
 

603
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,670
so does it make sense what's the time
complexity

604
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:21,680
complexity
 

605
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:34,470
complexity
what's the time rest

606
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:34,480

 

607
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,310

because we're moving here right we're

608
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:36,320
because we're moving here right we're
 

609
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,509
because we're moving here right we're
moving

610
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:39,519

 

611
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:40,629

okay

612
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:40,639
okay
 

613
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,710
okay
okay so and yeah because look we are

614
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:42,720
okay so and yeah because look we are
 

615
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,949
okay so and yeah because look we are
moving this window yeah so we're moving

616
00:12:44,949 --> 00:12:44,959
moving this window yeah so we're moving
 

617
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,030
moving this window yeah so we're moving
here not here right because this one is

618
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:47,040
here not here right because this one is
 

619
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,470
here not here right because this one is
here so sorry this end come on

620
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:50,480
here so sorry this end come on
 

621
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,269
here so sorry this end come on
okay and then

622
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:53,279
okay and then
 

623
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,949
okay and then
what's a space complexity

624
00:12:56,949 --> 00:12:56,959

 

625
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,650

what's the space for mercury

626
00:12:58,650 --> 00:12:58,660
what's the space for mercury
 

627
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:15,990
what's the space for mercury
[Music]

628
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:16,000

 

629
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,870

right and what's this space

630
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:20,880

 

631
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,870

look this is the same size yeah because

632
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:22,880
look this is the same size yeah because
 

633
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,430
look this is the same size yeah because
we you know all the time we just need

634
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:25,440
we you know all the time we just need
 

635
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,590
we you know all the time we just need
the space two counters to store

636
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:29,600
the space two counters to store
 

637
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,110
the space two counters to store
the number

638
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:31,120
the number
 

639
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,310
the number
of

640
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:32,320
of
 

641
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,790
of
energons right so what's that so it's

642
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:34,800
energons right so what's that so it's
 

643
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,629
energons right so what's that so it's
all n 0

644
00:13:36,629 --> 00:13:36,639
all n 0
 

645
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,829
all n 0
times 2

times 2
 

647
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,829
times 2
n 0 plus n 0 0 and 0 times 2 okay got it

648
00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:41,839
n 0 plus n 0 0 and 0 times 2 okay got it
 

649
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,350
n 0 plus n 0 0 and 0 times 2 okay got it
doesn't make sense eric okay

650
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:45,360
doesn't make sense eric okay
 

651
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,870
doesn't make sense eric okay
okay can you tell me how can we solve

because the window size is n0 so we get

722
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:11,120
because the window size is n0 so we get
 

723
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,470
because the window size is n0 so we get
the previous left most window uh

724
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:14,480
the previous left most window uh
 

725
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,829
the previous left most window uh
currently in the window yeah because

726
00:15:15,829 --> 00:15:15,839
currently in the window yeah because
 

727
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,430

00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:17,440
we're shifting right
 

729
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,670
we're shifting right
what does it mean by shifting we take

730
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:19,680
what does it mean by shifting we take
 

731
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,470
what does it mean by shifting we take
away the left mouse in a window and then

732
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:22,480
away the left mouse in a window and then
 

733
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,949
away the left mouse in a window and then
we add a new new

734
00:15:24,949 --> 00:15:24,959
we add a new new
 

735
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,470
we add a new new
new character in the window so we are

736
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:26,480
new character in the window so we are
 

737
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,910
new character in the window so we are
shifting basically with shifting this

738
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:27,920
shifting basically with shifting this
 

739
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,110
shifting basically with shifting this
window okay

740
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:29,120
window okay
 

741
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,470
window okay
okay and then if the window if this

742
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:32,480
okay and then if the window if this
 

743
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,870
okay and then if the window if this
map if this occurrence becomes zero we

744
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:34,880
map if this occurrence becomes zero we
 

745
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,870
map if this occurrence becomes zero we
need to remove it remove the entry from

746
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:36,880
need to remove it remove the entry from
 

747
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,189
need to remove it remove the entry from
the map okay this is what comparison

748
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:39,199
the map okay this is what comparison
 

749
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:40,949
the map okay this is what comparison
because we we want to check if current

750
00:15:40,949 --> 00:15:40,959
because we we want to check if current
 

751
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,350
because we we want to check if current
equals c then another plus one our plus

752
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:43,360
equals c then another plus one our plus
 

753
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,110
equals c then another plus one our plus
one we move this we shifted the window

754
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:45,120
one we move this we shifted the window
 

755
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,310
one we move this we shifted the window
one side to the right okay

756
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:48,320
one side to the right okay
 

757
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,590
one side to the right okay
okay that's it for today good job

758
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:51,600
okay that's it for today good job
