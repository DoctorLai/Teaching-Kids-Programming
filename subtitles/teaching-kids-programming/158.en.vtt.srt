i'll do a three here and draw here

18
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:32,640
i'll do a three here and draw here
 

19
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,270
i'll do a three here and draw here
okay well so what yeah you draw a binary

20
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:35,280
okay well so what yeah you draw a binary
 

21
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,430
okay well so what yeah you draw a binary
tree and it's finally says tree so what

22
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:37,440
tree and it's finally says tree so what
 

23
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,150
tree and it's finally says tree so what
makes it binary that's true

25
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,670

on the right right side is greater than

26
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:45,680
on the right right side is greater than
 

27
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,110
on the right right side is greater than
the parent and on the left side it's

28
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:49,120
the parent and on the left side it's
 

29
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,830
the parent and on the left side it's
uh smaller yeah yeah so smaller and then

30
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:51,840
uh smaller yeah yeah so smaller and then
 

31
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,150
uh smaller yeah yeah so smaller and then
look

32
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:52,160
look
 

33
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,310
look
this is this is on the right side of one

34
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:56,320
this is this is on the right side of one
 

35
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,310
this is this is on the right side of one
so it should be bigger right but it's on

36
00:00:58,310 --> 00:00:58,320
so it should be bigger right but it's on
 

37
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,830
so it should be bigger right but it's on
the left side of the three so it's

38
00:00:59,830 --> 00:00:59,840
the left side of the three so it's
 

39
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,869
the left side of the three so it's
smaller right

40
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:00,879
smaller right
 

41
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,990
smaller right
yeah so on which

42
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:04,000
yeah so on which
 

43
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,109
yeah so on which
order would give it a sorted list

44
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:07,119
order would give it a sorted list
 

45
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,350
order would give it a sorted list
which order remember we have the

46
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:09,360
which order remember we have the
 

47
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,510
which order remember we have the
pre-order in order for solder

48
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:11,520
pre-order in order for solder
 

49
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,510
pre-order in order for solder
yeah you know what in order yeah

50
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:15,520
yeah you know what in order yeah
 

51
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,710
yeah you know what in order yeah
so left no right right so it's never

52
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:18,720
so left no right right so it's never
 

53
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,109
so left no right right so it's never
known right you'll be zero one two three

54
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:21,119
known right you'll be zero one two three

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:21,749
known right you'll be zero one two three
four right

56
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:21,759
four right
 

57
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,310
four right
it's a sorted list and how about if it's

58
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:24,320
it's a sorted list and how about if it's
 

59
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,030
it's a sorted list and how about if it's
a

60
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:25,040
a
 

61
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,749
a
breakfast search what which order is it

62
00:01:27,749 --> 00:01:27,759
breakfast search what which order is it
 

63
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:28,230
breakfast search what which order is it
it's

64
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:28,240
it's
 

65
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,710
it's
one zero three two four yes level by

66
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:30,720
one zero three two four yes level by
 

67
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,789
one zero three two four yes level by
level and how about pre-order

68
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:32,799
level and how about pre-order
 

69
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,990
level and how about pre-order
uh that would be one zero three two

70
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:36,000
uh that would be one zero three two
 

71
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,069
uh that would be one zero three two
four one zero three two four and how

72
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:38,079
four one zero three two four and how
 

73
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,429
four one zero three two four and how
about post order

74
00:01:39,429 --> 00:01:39,439
about post order
 

75
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,550
about post order
okay that will be

76
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:42,560
okay that will be
 

77
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,069
okay that will be
zero uh like zero

78
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:46,079
zero uh like zero
 

79
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,109
zero uh like zero
two four yeah three

80
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:49,119
two four yeah three
 

81
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,749
two four yeah three
one we're done okay so you got it okay

82
00:01:51,749 --> 00:01:51,759
one we're done okay so you got it okay
 

83
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:52,310
one we're done okay so you got it okay
so

84
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:52,320
so
 

85
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,870
so
how about if i give you a range like

86
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:54,880
how about if i give you a range like
 

87
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,069
how about if i give you a range like
let's say

88
00:01:56,069 --> 00:01:56,079
let's say
 

89
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,510
let's say
uh 2 2

90
00:01:59,510 --> 00:01:59,520
uh 2 2
 

91
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,630
uh 2 2
4 2 left equals to 4

92
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:02,640
4 2 left equals to 4
 

93
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,270
4 2 left equals to 4
and i i want you to find out the sum of

94
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:05,280
and i i want you to find out the sum of
 

95
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,870
and i i want you to find out the sum of
all the notes within this

96
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:06,880
all the notes within this
 

97
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,070
all the notes within this
range inclusive 10 yeah can t

98
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:10,080
range inclusive 10 yeah can t
 

99
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,830
range inclusive 10 yeah can t
be in it yeah that's right well i said

100
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:11,840
be in it yeah that's right well i said
 

101
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,430
be in it yeah that's right well i said
inclusive when you say increase

102
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:13,440
inclusive when you say increase
 

103
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,350
inclusive when you say increase
when it's inclusive you put a bracket

104
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:15,360
when it's inclusive you put a bracket
 

105
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,710
when it's inclusive you put a bracket
yeah this is inclusive

106
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:16,720
yeah this is inclusive
 

107
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,869
yeah this is inclusive
yeah there will be two three and four

108
00:02:18,869 --> 00:02:18,879
yeah there will be two three and four
 

109
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:19,830
yeah there will be two three and four
yeah

110
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:19,840
yeah
 

111
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,990
yeah
and if it's inclusive if it's not

112
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,000
and if it's inclusive if it's not
 

113
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,270
and if it's inclusive if it's not
inclusive you put this

114
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:23,280
inclusive you put this
 

115
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,070
inclusive you put this
curly brace if this is right this

116
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:26,080
curly brace if this is right this
 

117
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,710
curly brace if this is right this
bracket

118
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:26,720
bracket
 

119
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,910
bracket
means two and four is not in it square

120
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:29,920
means two and four is not in it square
 

121
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,390
means two and four is not in it square
bracket

122
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:30,400
bracket
 

123
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,670
bracket
means in it okay okay yeah

124
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:33,680
means in it okay okay yeah
 

125
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,710
means in it okay okay yeah
so two three four right the sum would be

126
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:36,720
so two three four right the sum would be
 

127
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,390
so two three four right the sum would be
nine right yeah okay so hope yeah

128
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:40,400
nine right yeah okay so hope yeah
 

129
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,869
nine right yeah okay so hope yeah
today we're task is our task is given

130
00:02:42,869 --> 00:02:42,879
today we're task is our task is given
 

131
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,550
today we're task is our task is given
the root of the binary switch

132
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:44,560
the root of the binary switch
 

133
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,550
the root of the binary switch
and then the left and the right which

134
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:46,560
and then the left and the right which
 

135
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,390
and then the left and the right which
means the inclusive range of the lower

136
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:48,400
means the inclusive range of the lower
 

137
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,670
means the inclusive range of the lower
bound and upper bound

138
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:49,680
bound and upper bound
 

139
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,750
bound and upper bound
we want to sum up the notes within the

140
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:51,760
we want to sum up the notes within the
 

141
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,710
we want to sum up the notes within the
range

142
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:52,720
range
 

143
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,050
range
so how can we do this

144
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:55,060
so how can we do this
 

145
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,790
so how can we do this

like something
 

151
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,990
like something
oh yeah right yeah

152
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,000
oh yeah right yeah
 

153
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,229
oh yeah right yeah
in order yes in order

154
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:12,239
in order yes in order
 

155
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,990
in order yes in order
and then you know so in order notes you

156
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,000
and then you know so in order notes you
 

157
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,790
and then you know so in order notes you
will have

158
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:16,800
will have
 

159
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,430
will have
one two three four right zero one two

160
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:19,440
one two three four right zero one two
 

161
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,070
one two three four right zero one two
three four

162
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:20,080
three four
 

163
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,750
three four
that would be uh yeah

164
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:23,760
that would be uh yeah
 

165
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,350
that would be uh yeah
when you do in order what's the time

166
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:25,360
when you do in order what's the time

00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:29,920
oh like ten
 

171
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,949
oh like ten
and n is the number of nodes yeah yeah

172
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:32,959
and n is the number of nodes yeah yeah
 

173
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,589
and n is the number of nodes yeah yeah
and then one thing you have all in order

174
00:03:35,589 --> 00:03:35,599
and then one thing you have all in order
 

175
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,390
and then one thing you have all in order
so you you

176
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:36,400
so you you
 

177
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,470
so you you
you must store this in an array right

178
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:38,480
you must store this in an array right
 

179
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,990
you must store this in an array right
let's also take owen

180
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:40,000
let's also take owen
 

181
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,630
let's also take owen
space right yeah and then you want to

182
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:42,640
space right yeah and then you want to
 

183
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,550
space right yeah and then you want to
find out the two and four right

184
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:44,560
find out the two and four right
 

185
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,030
find out the two and four right
two and four for example you find these

186
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:47,040
two and four for example you find these
 

187
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,949
two and four for example you find these
two here and four here

188
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:48,959
two here and four here
 

189
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,710
two here and four here
and then you just sum it up yeah yeah

190
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:50,720
and then you just sum it up yeah yeah
 

191
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,030
and then you just sum it up yeah yeah
and if the two and four is not there you

192
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,040
and if the two and four is not there you
 

193
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,070
and if the two and four is not there you
find the one

194
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:54,080
find the one
 

195
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,949
find the one
between yeah you know okay so how do you

196
00:03:56,949 --> 00:03:56,959
between yeah you know okay so how do you
 

197
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,710
between yeah you know okay so how do you
find the two and four

198
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:58,720
find the two and four
 

199
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,140
find the two and four
okay

200
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:01,150

 

201
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:10,470

[Music]

202
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:10,480
[Music]
 

203
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,789
[Music]
you are doing the linear search right

204
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:12,799
you are doing the linear search right
 

205
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,550
you are doing the linear search right
can we do better because it's already

206
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:14,560
can we do better because it's already
 

207
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,429
can we do better because it's already
sorted

208
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:15,439
sorted
 

209
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,469
sorted
so we can use what linear search is o n

210
00:04:18,469 --> 00:04:18,479
so we can use what linear search is o n
 

211
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:19,030
so we can use what linear search is o n
right

212
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:19,040
right
 

213
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,670
right
you'll find another one term right yeah

214
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:21,680
you'll find another one term right yeah
 

215
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,749
you'll find another one term right yeah
so what

216
00:04:23,749 --> 00:04:23,759
so what
 

217
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,590
so what
how can we do it better make it better

218
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:27,600
how can we do it better make it better
 

219
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,310
how can we do it better make it better
if it's just salted remember if it's

220
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:30,320
if it's just salted remember if it's
 

221
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,070
if it's just salted remember if it's
salted we want to find an element in the

222
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,080
salted we want to find an element in the
 

223
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,870
salted we want to find an element in the
sorted list

224
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:32,880
sorted list
 

225
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:39,909
sorted list
we can use you know cut in half

226
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:39,919

 

227
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,310

again yeah what's that name called

228
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:42,320
again yeah what's that name called
 

229
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,189
again yeah what's that name called
binary

230
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:43,199
binary
 

231
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,270
binary
binary what yeah we're done binary word

232
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:47,280
binary what yeah we're done binary word
 

233
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,070
binary what yeah we're done binary word
final research come on yeah you want

234
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,080
final research come on yeah you want
 

235
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,030
final research come on yeah you want
because this is

236
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:51,040
because this is
 

237
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,189
because this is
sorted and you want to find the number

238
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:53,199
sorted and you want to find the number
 

239
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,030
sorted and you want to find the number
it's finally searching okay

240
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:55,040
it's finally searching okay
 

241
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,070
it's finally searching okay
wait we're done right binary search

242
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,080
wait we're done right binary search
 

243
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,790
wait we're done right binary search
okay but and you'll find two two times

244
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:00,800
okay but and you'll find two two times
 

245
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,870
okay but and you'll find two two times
the binary search login right

246
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:02,880
the binary search login right
 

247
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,189
the binary search login right
yeah and then you sum it up right so

248
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:05,199
yeah and then you sum it up right so
 

249
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,670
yeah and then you sum it up right so
that complexity is still on because

250
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:07,680
that complexity is still on because
 

251
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,870
that complexity is still on because
you've got the o and

252
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:08,880
you've got the o and
 

253
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,430
you've got the o and
right at the beginning can we do better

254
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:11,440
right at the beginning can we do better
 

255
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,749
right at the beginning can we do better
yeah can we do better

256
00:05:13,749 --> 00:05:13,759
yeah can we do better
 

257
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,830
yeah can we do better
do we actually need to perform this in

258
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:15,840
do we actually need to perform this in
 

259
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,950
do we actually need to perform this in
order

260
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:16,960
order
 

261
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,350
order
wait wait wait wait wait actually wait

262
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:19,360
wait wait wait wait wait actually wait
 

263
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,469
wait wait wait wait wait actually wait
you stop

264
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:20,479
you stop
 

265
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:30,550
you stop
you start from here and wait okay

266
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:30,560

 

267
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,790

you don't need to check this one because

268
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:32,800
you don't need to check this one because
 

269
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,990
you don't need to check this one because
because it's smaller

270
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:34,000
because it's smaller
 

271
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:42,070
because it's smaller
and and it's not in the regular table so

272
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:42,080

 

273
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,710

so previously uh you can actually

274
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:44,720
so previously uh you can actually
 

275
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,790
so previously uh you can actually
iterate all the nodes yeah proof of

276
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:46,800
iterate all the nodes yeah proof of
 

277
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,469
iterate all the nodes yeah proof of
all the nodes and check each node if

278
00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:48,479
all the nodes and check each node if
 

279
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,469
all the nodes and check each node if
it's in a range yeah that's the proof of

280
00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:50,479
it's in a range yeah that's the proof of
 

281
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:51,430
it's in a range yeah that's the proof of
thirds right

282
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:51,440
thirds right
 

283
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,749
thirds right
and if you want to prove us the uh

284
00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:53,759
and if you want to prove us the uh
 

285
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,029
and if you want to prove us the uh
integrate

286
00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:55,039
integrate
 

287
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,950
integrate
uh traversal the binary issue you've got

288
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:56,960
uh traversal the binary issue you've got
 

289
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,629
uh traversal the binary issue you've got
a lot of traversing

290
00:05:58,629 --> 00:05:58,639
a lot of traversing
 

291
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,950
a lot of traversing
agreement like uh default search

292
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:00,960
agreement like uh default search
 

293
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,950
agreement like uh default search
breakfast search yeah pre-order in all

294
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:02,960
breakfast search yeah pre-order in all
 

295
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,830
breakfast search yeah pre-order in all
the

296
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:03,840
the
 

297
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,390
the
post order yeah as long as you can check

298
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:06,400
post order yeah as long as you can check
 

299
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,270
post order yeah as long as you can check
all the notes

300
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:07,280
all the notes
 

301
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,230
all the notes
in the range right and then you'll check

302
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:10,240
in the range right and then you'll check
 

303
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,830
in the range right and then you'll check
if it's the inner range you sum it up

304
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:11,840
if it's the inner range you sum it up
 

305
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,590
if it's the inner range you sum it up
right does it make sense

306
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:13,600
right does it make sense
 

307
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,189
right does it make sense
can we do better

308
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:17,199

 

309
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,189

wait then let me just implement this

310
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:19,199
wait then let me just implement this
 

311
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,029
wait then let me just implement this
okay and then you can tell me how can we

312
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:21,039
okay and then you can tell me how can we
 

313
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:21,830
okay and then you can tell me how can we
make it better

314
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:21,840
make it better
 

315
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,710
make it better
i think you've got the idea okay define

316
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:24,720
i think you've got the idea okay define
 

317
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,230
i think you've got the idea okay define
okay let's say

318
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:26,240
okay let's say
 

319
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,430
okay let's say
as f function we have a root

320
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:29,440
as f function we have a root
 

321
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,510
as f function we have a root
we have a left we have a right yeah but

322
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:31,520
we have a left we have a right yeah but
 

323
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,550
we have a left we have a right yeah but
we are not using

324
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:32,560
we are not using
 

325
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,070
we are not using
this at the moment so look if

326
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:36,080
this at the moment so look if
 

327
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,230
this at the moment so look if
not load yeah if the load is empty then

328
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:40,240
not load yeah if the load is empty then
 

329
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,469
not load yeah if the load is empty then
we return what

330
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:42,479
we return what
 

331
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,629
we return what
nothing zero right because we only find

332
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:44,639
nothing zero right because we only find
 

333
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,749
nothing zero right because we only find
the sum right

334
00:06:45,749 --> 00:06:45,759
the sum right
 

335
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,909
the sum right
yeah then we can have answer equals

336
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:49,919
yeah then we can have answer equals
 

337
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,430
yeah then we can have answer equals
zero and now we can say if lu dot

338
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:53,440
zero and now we can say if lu dot
 

339
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,550
zero and now we can say if lu dot
value if it's bigger than

340
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:56,560
value if it's bigger than
 

341
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,830
value if it's bigger than
l smaller than r then i will i add the

342
00:06:59,830 --> 00:06:59,840
l smaller than r then i will i add the
 

343
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,629
l smaller than r then i will i add the
answer it's in the range right yeah

344
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:02,639
answer it's in the range right yeah
 

345
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,670
answer it's in the range right yeah
lose the value right all right look if

346
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:05,680
lose the value right all right look if
 

347
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,150
lose the value right all right look if
current node is between this range

348
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:08,160
current node is between this range
 

349
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,870
current node is between this range
i answer i will definitely include no

350
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:10,880
i answer i will definitely include no
 

351
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,510
i answer i will definitely include no
right

352
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:11,520
right
 

353
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,629
right
yes and then i can say answer

354
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:14,639
yes and then i can say answer
 

355
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:20,790
yes and then i can say answer
plus equals f load the left

356
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:20,800

 

357
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,710

left right and then can you tell me

358
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:22,720
left right and then can you tell me
 

359
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,110
left right and then can you tell me
what's next answer plus equal one

360
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:25,120
what's next answer plus equal one
 

361
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:31,830
what's next answer plus equal one
f with the right yeah

362
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:31,840

 

363
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,110

yeah yeah okay so let's complex t what's

364
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:35,120
yeah yeah okay so let's complex t what's
 

365
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,350
yeah yeah okay so let's complex t what's
the term complexity for this one

366
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:37,360
the term complexity for this one
 

367
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,589
the term complexity for this one
oh and because we are we need to visit

368
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:39,599
oh and because we are we need to visit
 

369
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,070
oh and because we are we need to visit
all the nodes in the binary tree right

370
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:42,080
all the nodes in the binary tree right
 

371
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,430
all the nodes in the binary tree right
all right can we do better look at

372
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:45,440
all right can we do better look at
 

373
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,550
all right can we do better look at
you're right right look if this is one

374
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:48,560
you're right right look if this is one
 

375
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,749
you're right right look if this is one
zero three

376
00:07:51,749 --> 00:07:51,759
zero three
 

377
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,070
zero three
two four yeah if we want to

378
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:56,080
two four yeah if we want to
 

379
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,830
two four yeah if we want to
find a between two and four

380
00:07:59,830 --> 00:07:59,840
find a between two and four
 

381
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,550
find a between two and four
right look if it wants to find the

382
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:02,560
right look if it wants to find the
 

383
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,749
right look if it wants to find the
between two and four

384
00:08:05,749 --> 00:08:05,759

 

385
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,189

if it's bigger than it is one

386
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:09,199
if it's bigger than it is one
 

387
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,550
if it's bigger than it is one
in this range oh no no right

388
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:12,560
in this range oh no no right
 

389
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,589
in this range oh no no right
because one is smaller than two right

390
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:15,599
because one is smaller than two right
 

391
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,950
because one is smaller than two right
if we go to the left you'll be also

392
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:18,960
if we go to the left you'll be also
 

393
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,830
if we go to the left you'll be also
you'll be even smaller so none of these

394
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:21,840
you'll be even smaller so none of these
 

395
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,710
you'll be even smaller so none of these
notes will be

396
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:22,720
notes will be
 

397
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,110
notes will be
inside this one right so i need to go to

398
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:25,120
inside this one right so i need to go to
 

399
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,150
inside this one right so i need to go to
the right all right that

400
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:26,160
the right all right that
 

401
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,670
the right all right that
makes sense yeah so so yeah

402
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:29,680
makes sense yeah so so yeah
 

403
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,709
makes sense yeah so so yeah
yeah i know i know you know so look so

404
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:32,719
yeah i know i know you know so look so
 

405
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,310
yeah i know i know you know so look so
all we have to do is when we're

406
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:34,320
all we have to do is when we're
 

407
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,269
all we have to do is when we're
traveling to the left

408
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:37,279
traveling to the left
 

409
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,310
traveling to the left
we don't need to look so so how how can

410
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:40,320
we don't need to look so so how how can
 

411
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:40,790
we don't need to look so so how how can
do this

412
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:40,800
do this
 

413
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,829
do this
so if if so we put it here here

414
00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:43,839
so if if so we put it here here
 

415
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,470
so if if so we put it here here
if blue dot value

416
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:48,480
if blue dot value
 

417
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,829
if blue dot value
right if root of value

418
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:51,839
right if root of value
 

419
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,269
right if root of value
is is what is bigger than 2

420
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:55,279
is is what is bigger than 2
 

421
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,070
is is what is bigger than 2
is bigger than 2 bigger than r then we

422
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:58,080
is bigger than 2 bigger than r then we
 

423
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,990
is bigger than 2 bigger than r then we
do this right

424
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:00,000
do this right
 

425
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,110
do this right
then here

426
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:03,120

 

427
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,829

here what do we do with this if root of

428
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:06,839
here what do we do with this if root of
 

429
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,710
here what do we do with this if root of
value

430
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:08,720
value
 

431
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,070
value
is smaller than r right all right

432
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:12,080
is smaller than r right all right
 

433
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,110
is smaller than r right all right
look if this value is bigger bigger than

434
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:15,120
look if this value is bigger bigger than
 

435
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,829
look if this value is bigger bigger than
2

436
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:15,839
2
 

437
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,070
2
then we can go to the left if it's

438
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:18,080
then we can go to the left if it's
 

439
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,910
then we can go to the left if it's
smaller than 4

440
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:19,920
smaller than 4
 

441
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,829
smaller than 4
then we can go to the right right if

442
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:21,839
then we can go to the right right if
 

443
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,030
then we can go to the right right if
it's bigger than four

444
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:25,040

 

445
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,470

we don't need to go to the right because

446
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:26,480
we don't need to go to the right because
 

447
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,150
we don't need to go to the right because
it's always bigger it's always bigger

448
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:28,160
it's always bigger it's always bigger
 

449
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,750
it's always bigger it's always bigger
than this region right

450
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:29,760
than this region right
 

451
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,910
than this region right
doesn't make sense so all we have to do

452
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:31,920
doesn't make sense so all we have to do
 

453
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,790
doesn't make sense so all we have to do
is put two

454
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:32,800
is put two
 

455
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,389
is put two
if yeah without these two if

456
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:36,399
if yeah without these two if
 

457
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,670
if yeah without these two if
there will be o n no be blue forcing but

00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,230
right remember how many nodes are there
how many nodes are there seven seven

502
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:34,240
how many nodes are there seven seven
 

503
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,910
how many nodes are there seven seven
nodes what's the height

504
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:35,920
nodes what's the height
 

505
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,150
nodes what's the height
three yeah so log two seven is roughly

506
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:40,160
three yeah so log two seven is roughly
 

507
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,430
three yeah so log two seven is roughly
three right yeah all right it's all

508
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:43,440
three right yeah all right it's all
 

509
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,550
three right yeah all right it's all
actually all log two a

510
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:46,560
actually all log two a
 

511
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,350
actually all log two a
is 3. 2 to the power 3 equals 8 right

512
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:49,360
is 3. 2 to the power 3 equals 8 right
 

513
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,190
is 3. 2 to the power 3 equals 8 right
that's where it comes from okay

514
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:51,200
that's where it comes from okay
 

515
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:57,670
that's where it comes from okay
yeah does it make sense yeah mommy not

516
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:57,680

 

517
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,870

ok so now we this is recursion

518
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:00,880
ok so now we this is recursion
 

519
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,790
ok so now we this is recursion
yeah where is the recursion happening

520
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:04,800
yeah where is the recursion happening
 

521
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,829
yeah where is the recursion happening
where is the recursion

522
00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:07,839

 

523
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,470

what's a good question oh wait wait wait

524
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:10,480
what's a good question oh wait wait wait
 

525
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,990
what's a good question oh wait wait wait
talking about itself

526
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:12,000
talking about itself
 

527
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,069
talking about itself
yeah it's calling itself and which part

528
00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:14,079
yeah it's calling itself and which part
 

529
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,829
yeah it's calling itself and which part
is calling itself

530
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:15,839
is calling itself
 

531
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,110
is calling itself
yeah f f function right yeah right

532
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:19,120
yeah f f function right yeah right
 

533
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,069
yeah f f function right yeah right
down everywhere okay we can do it

534
00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:22,079
down everywhere okay we can do it
 

535
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,150
down everywhere okay we can do it
without the recursion

536
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:24,160
without the recursion
 

537
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,430
without the recursion
yeah remember previously no no no

538
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:27,440
yeah remember previously no no no
 

539
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,069
yeah remember previously no no no
we use the stack right to remember that

540
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:30,079
we use the stack right to remember that
 

541
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,509
we use the stack right to remember that
the thingy

542
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:31,519
the thingy
 

543
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,350
the thingy
the left tree right three and then we

544
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:33,360
the left tree right three and then we
 

545
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,030
the left tree right three and then we
reverse it right there

546
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:35,040
reverse it right there
 

547
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,509
reverse it right there
a few days ago i show you oh yeah i

548
00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:37,519
a few days ago i show you oh yeah i
 

549
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:38,389
a few days ago i show you oh yeah i
think i remember

550
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:38,399
think i remember
 

551
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,870
think i remember
that yeah you'll remember that okay so

552
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:40,880
that yeah you'll remember that okay so
 

553
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,670
that yeah you'll remember that okay so
let's do this

554
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:43,680
let's do this
 

555
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,710
let's do this
what root left

556
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:46,720
what root left
 

557
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,230
what root left
right

558
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:50,240

 

559
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,069

yeah just scale mommy a little bit

560
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:54,079
yeah just scale mommy a little bit
 

561
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,110
yeah just scale mommy a little bit
if not this is the same

562
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:57,120
if not this is the same
 

563
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,350
if not this is the same
it normally returns right yeah okay now

564
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:01,360
it normally returns right yeah okay now
 

565
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,670
it normally returns right yeah okay now
now we have a answer yeah we also have

566
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:03,680
now we have a answer yeah we also have
 

567
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,670
now we have a answer yeah we also have
an answer equals zero and now we have a

568
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:05,680
an answer equals zero and now we have a
 

569
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,550
an answer equals zero and now we have a
stack

570
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:06,560
stack
 

571
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,550
stack
we have a stack equals at the beginning

572
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:08,560
we have a stack equals at the beginning
 

573
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,750
we have a stack equals at the beginning
we put a load in it

574
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:09,760
we put a load in it
 

575
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,190
we put a load in it
right right and then

576
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:13,200
right right and then
 

577
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,110
right right and then
wire while this stack stack is less and

578
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:17,120
wire while this stack stack is less and
 

579
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,069
wire while this stack stack is less and
it's not empty while there's element

580
00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:20,079
it's not empty while there's element
 

581
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:20,470
it's not empty while there's element
stack

582
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:20,480
stack
 

583
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,670
stack
we want to pop it current

584
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:23,680
we want to pop it current
 

585
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,269
we want to pop it current
equals stack how do we get the element

586
00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:27,279
equals stack how do we get the element
 

587
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,069
equals stack how do we get the element
from the stack

588
00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:28,079
from the stack
 

589
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,430
from the stack
oh we pop it yeah pop

590
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:31,440
oh we pop it yeah pop
 

591
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,790
oh we pop it yeah pop
okay now look if caroline

592
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:36,800

 

593
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,910

you currently look if

594
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:39,920
you currently look if
 

595
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,509
you currently look if
it's current and if

596
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:43,519
it's current and if
 

597
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,550
it's current and if
current of value is

598
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:46,560
current of value is
 

599
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,750
current of value is
in a range in the range we we add it to

600
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:49,760
in a range in the range we we add it to
 

601
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,350
in a range in the range we we add it to
the answer right

602
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:51,360
the answer right
 

603
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,069
the answer right
10 yeah answer i say it's a number yeah

604
00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:54,079
10 yeah answer i say it's a number yeah
 

605
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,750
10 yeah answer i say it's a number yeah
current of value

606
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:55,760
current of value
 

607
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,350
current of value
level what and then here if current

608
00:12:59,350 --> 00:12:59,360
level what and then here if current
 

609
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,949
level what and then here if current
value is bigger than left

610
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:02,959
value is bigger than left
 

611
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,949
value is bigger than left
right then we we put it in a stack stack

612
00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:06,959
right then we we put it in a stack stack
 

613
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:07,750
right then we we put it in a stack stack
dot append

614
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:07,760
dot append
 

615
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,949
dot append
yeah okay we put it in a stack so we put

616
00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:10,959
yeah okay we put it in a stack so we put
 

617
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:11,829
yeah okay we put it in a stack so we put
it in the stacks

618
00:13:11,829 --> 00:13:11,839
it in the stacks
 

619
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,190
it in the stacks
current or left okay

620
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:15,200
current or left okay
 

621
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,430
current or left okay
and then if what current value

622
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:19,440
and then if what current value
 

623
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,110
and then if what current value
what smaller than one ah

624
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:23,120
what smaller than one ah
 

625
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,150
what smaller than one ah
on the right side then we do this stack

626
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:26,160
on the right side then we do this stack
 

627
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,190
on the right side then we do this stack
dot append

628
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:29,200

 

629
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,310

current one right right right turn and

630
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:32,320
current one right right right turn and
 

631
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:32,629
current one right right right turn and
right

632
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:32,639
right
 

633
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,710
right
on the stack and then return what answer

634
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:36,720
on the stack and then return what answer
 

635
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,870
on the stack and then return what answer
we can answer so you see we're using a

636
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:38,880
we can answer so you see we're using a
 

637
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,470
we can answer so you see we're using a
stack yeah you're using a state

638
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:40,480
stack yeah you're using a state
 

639
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,910
stack yeah you're using a state
let's do that example okay

640
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:43,920
let's do that example okay
 

641
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,380
let's do that example okay
one zero three

642
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:48,390
one zero three
 

643
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:53,430
one zero three
[Music]

644
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:53,440

 

645
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,750

okay let's take at the beginning is put

646
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:55,760
okay let's take at the beginning is put
 

647
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,110
okay let's take at the beginning is put
a one here right

648
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:57,120
a one here right
 

649
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,230
a one here right
yeah answer is zero answer is zero

650
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:02,240
yeah answer is zero answer is zero
 

651
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,189
yeah answer is zero answer is zero
so and the answer equals zero

652
00:14:07,189 --> 00:14:07,199

 

653
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,310

we get an element from stack take it out

654
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:10,320
we get an element from stack take it out
 

655
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,509
we get an element from stack take it out
if if if this current value

656
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:13,519
if if if this current value
 

657
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,189
if if if this current value
is between two to 4 no

658
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:17,199
is between two to 4 no
 

659
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,829
is between two to 4 no
then i skip this if current value is

660
00:14:19,829 --> 00:14:19,839
then i skip this if current value is
 

661
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,269
then i skip this if current value is
bigger than

662
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:21,279
bigger than
 

663
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:24,310
bigger than
2 no right

664
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:24,320
2 no right
 

665
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,870
2 no right
if current value is smaller than r yes

666
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:26,880
if current value is smaller than r yes
 

667
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,350
if current value is smaller than r yes
because

668
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:27,360
because
 

669
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,829
because
1 is r small r is 4 yeah y is smaller

670
00:14:29,829 --> 00:14:29,839
1 is r small r is 4 yeah y is smaller
 

671
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,030
1 is r small r is 4 yeah y is smaller
than four right

672
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:31,040
than four right
 

673
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,389
than four right
then i put it right which is three

674
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:34,399
then i put it right which is three
 

675
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,590
then i put it right which is three
put it here in a stack here right okay

676
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:37,600
put it here in a stack here right okay
 

677
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,269
put it here in a stack here right okay
and then i go to the next

678
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:39,279
and then i go to the next
 

679
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,389
and then i go to the next
i take the element from three

680
00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:42,399
i take the element from three
 

681
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,509
i take the element from three
if three is smaller than two uh is it

682
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:45,519
if three is smaller than two uh is it
 

683
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,710
if three is smaller than two uh is it
between two and four

684
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:46,720
between two and four
 

685
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,590
between two and four
yes then we put a three add it to the

686
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:49,600
yes then we put a three add it to the
 

687
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,870
yes then we put a three add it to the
answer so angle

688
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:50,880
answer so angle
 

689
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,629
answer so angle
plus three which is three if three

690
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:54,639
plus three which is three if three
 

691
00:14:54,639 --> 00:15:01,350
plus three which is three if three
is bigger than one yeah

692
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:01,360

 

693
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,629

bigger than two yeah three

694
00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:04,639
bigger than two yeah three
 

695
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,670
bigger than two yeah three
now we are three bigger than two yes so

696
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:07,680
now we are three bigger than two yes so
 

697
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,949
now we are three bigger than two yes so
we put the left

698
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:08,959
we put the left
 

699
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,670
we put the left
which is two on the stack right here

700
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:11,680
which is two on the stack right here
 

701
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,629
which is two on the stack right here
yeah

702
00:15:12,629 --> 00:15:12,639
yeah
 

703
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,829
yeah
if three is smaller than four

704
00:15:15,829 --> 00:15:15,839
if three is smaller than four
 

705
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,710
if three is smaller than four
yes we put the right on the stack which

706
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:18,720
yes we put the right on the stack which
 

707
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,910
yes we put the right on the stack which
is four

708
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:19,920
is four
 

709
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,269
is four
okay yeah okay the next one

710
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:23,279
okay yeah okay the next one
 

711
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,550
okay yeah okay the next one
we take it off take the four off

712
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:26,560
we take it off take the four off
 

713
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,430
we take it off take the four off
if 4 is smaller than between 2 and 4 yes

714
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:29,440
if 4 is smaller than between 2 and 4 yes
 

715
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,350
if 4 is smaller than between 2 and 4 yes
we add 4 here right

716
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:31,360
we add 4 here right
 

717
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,310
we add 4 here right
yeah all right it doesn't have anything

718
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:34,320
yeah all right it doesn't have anything
 

719
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,110
yeah all right it doesn't have anything
it doesn't have

720
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:35,120
it doesn't have
 

721
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,269
it doesn't have
because you put it left and right and

722
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:37,279
because you put it left and right and
 

723
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,350
because you put it left and right and
you'll be empty and it will be

724
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:39,360
you'll be empty and it will be
 

725
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,590
you'll be empty and it will be
you will not come in here again and then

726
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:41,600
you will not come in here again and then
 

727
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,590
you will not come in here again and then
another thing is two

728
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:43,600
another thing is two
 

729
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,150
another thing is two
take it out okay two is between two and

730
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:46,160
take it out okay two is between two and
 

731
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,350
take it out okay two is between two and
four yes plus two

732
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:47,360
four yes plus two
 

733
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,670
four yes plus two
so the answer is three plus four plus

734
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:49,680
so the answer is three plus four plus
 

735
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,710
so the answer is three plus four plus
two

736
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:50,720
two
 

737
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,550
two
nine yeah with an answer does it make

738
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:52,560
nine yeah with an answer does it make
 

739
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,069
nine yeah with an answer does it make
sense yeah

740
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:54,079
sense yeah
 

741
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,069
sense yeah
does it make sense okay what's the time

742
00:15:56,069 --> 00:15:56,079
does it make sense okay what's the time
 

743
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,470
does it make sense okay what's the time
complexity as well

744
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:58,480
complexity as well
 

745
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:04,870
complexity as well
are you logging in

746
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:04,880

 

747
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,949

right this is the same as the previous

748
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:06,959
right this is the same as the previous
 

749
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,110
right this is the same as the previous
one including bracket

750
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:09,120
one including bracket
 

751
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,590
one including bracket
yeah it's the same what's a space

752
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:11,600
yeah it's the same what's a space
 

753
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:17,430
yeah it's the same what's a space
complexity

754
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:17,440

 

755
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:25,829

why is

756
