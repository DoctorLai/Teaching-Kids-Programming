1
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:12,000
okay so just imagine I have three bags

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:14,580
three different bags okay so three

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,420
different kinds of bags so each pack is

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:21,300
given a number zero minus one one yeah

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:25,800
three kinds of bag so the question is

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:27,779
that we want to pick a exactly K bags

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,580
there are only three kinds of bags right

8
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:31,679
and then I tell you how many of each

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:34,079
candies all right so for example like

10
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:37,260
this is zeros yeah

11
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,059
there are zeros there are Z

12
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,899
Eros

13
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:45,780
this is minus one negative one next

14
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:49,500
minus one and this is the one so we say

15
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:52,739
one okay if we have five bags of zero

16
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:56,520
three bags of minus one and two bags of

17
00:00:52,739 --> 00:01:01,079
one and we want to pick pick the K bags

18
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:03,420
K is smaller or equal then these three

19
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:07,500
numbers added together okay obviously

20
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,460
right so if we want to pick k equals two

21
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,680
bags

22
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,780
so we want to maximize the sum so what's

23
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,939
the sum easy question you say everybody

24
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,880
it's easy okay so put it this way no

25
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:21,240
back so I find numbers you know three

26
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:23,400
numbers three times minus one

27
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,560
for number one we have two times and we

28
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,540
want to pick two times we want to pick

29
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,880
two numbers we want to maximize the

30
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:33,299
numbers we pick is it

31
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:35,100
two yes two okay if I want to pick

32
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:37,439
exactly three numbers what's the sum

33
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,960
look I have five zeros which one is the

34
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:43,380
noun and which one is the amount

35
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,960
it's numbers okay this is a mouth

36
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:49,520
oh this is the number

37
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,520
oh okay

38
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:56,640
I want to pick three numbers the ones

39
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:58,560
the ones and uh and one of the zeros

40
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,299
yeah so that's three or two right okay

41
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,520
you get it okay I want to pick seven

42
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:04,259
numbers

43
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:07,799
you get all the twos and then

44
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:11,879
the zeros what's awesome two I want to

45
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:16,040
pick a numbers versus some one okay good

46
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:16,040
then okay so that's good you understand

47
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:26,280
too hard

48
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:29,160
it's hard to explain right

49
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:32,220
so do you understand this zero minus one

50
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:34,920
one I have five times of zero three

51
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:37,379
times a minus one two times a one the

52
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:40,800
question is I want to pick K exactly K

53
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:42,959
numbers and K is smaller and equal than

54
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,260
all the three numbers added up together

55
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:48,180
so in this case it's ten K is smaller

56
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:50,940
than 10 obviously because they only ten

57
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:54,360
items I want to pick K item which is

58
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,280
smaller than 10 right so if we want to

59
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,920
pick two items obviously we'll pick the

60
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,379
ones because they give you maximum then

61
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,360
if I want to pick three numbers so you

62
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:05,580
picked it from a zero right it doesn't

63
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,800
change and if I want to pick seven

64
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:11,040
numbers obviously you take all the tools

65
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:12,620
and all the zeros right the sum is still

66
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,760
two if I want to pick a numbers

67
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:17,360
unfortunately you have to take a minus

68
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:20,819
one am I

69
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,140
make sense now no which probably you

70
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:24,900
don't understand

71
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:26,700
in the last part he said unfortunately

72
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,620
you have to take away yeah because the

73
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:31,319
question is that we have to take exactly

74
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:34,319
K numbers

75
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:37,080
okay yeah so I want to find out the sum

76
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:40,519
what's the stress again to get the ones

77
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,519
all of them and

78
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:47,520
[Music]

79
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:54,599
oh yeah I thought you had to make a sum

80
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:57,120
of two and I was like two ones is two

81
00:03:54,599 --> 00:04:00,360
and and it's like five zeros and two

82
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,400
ones is two and I I and then and then I

83
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,519
was so confused when you said you minus

84
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,280
one okay so let me rephrase this okay

85
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:11,159
the only three types of items zero minus

86
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:13,379
one one right they've done this and we

87
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:16,139
know exactly how many of each

88
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:18,500
all right I want to pick exactly we want

89
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:18,500
to pick

90
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:24,479
K numbers

91
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,120
PK numbers and we want to maximize the

92
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,560
sum maximize the sound

93
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,440
okay

94
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,180
so let's strategy yes we picked the ones

95
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,759
first you pick the bigger numbers

96
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:37,440
because it's worth all of them

97
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,600
so how do we solve this problem because

98
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,300
we said okay we pick these numbers first

99
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,639
we pick the ones and if we still have to

100
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:47,100
pick one we pick the zeros if we still

101
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:50,000
have to pick more we pick a negative one

102
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,000
right okay

103
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,660
that's a corner case I like that I like

104
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:00,199
the way you think okay Corner case

105
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:03,000
what's Corner cases

106
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:05,040
when you pick more than that right okay

107
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,259
so this is the requirement it's smaller

108
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:10,080
so you can pick more than 10 numbers

109
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:12,360
here don't get it okay so there's one

110
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,220
corner case think about it what's

111
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,320
another Corner cases look this is the

112
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:19,500
color cases you want to pick more what

113
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,360
happened okay so the question already uh

114
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,100
said you can't pick more than that right

115
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,800
this is the constraint

116
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:30,080
on the other hand if we pick nothing

117
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,080
what happened right if K is yellow

118
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:37,259
just given these three numbers right

119
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:39,900
like this is the z neck one and then

120
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:42,900
this K how do we get the sum maximize

121
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:45,120
some how do you implement it yeah I know

122
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:47,520
the solution is that okay we want to

123
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,680
pick this pick we are pillar but but how

124
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,979
would you do it and pick the biggest

125
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,240
numbers if K is smaller than one what

126
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:56,699
should we return

127
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,620
if K it will pick one number what should

128
00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:02,400
return

129
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:05,160
just one right but if there are two

130
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,800
million two million ones and if we want

131
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:11,160
to pick a hundred what's the answer

132
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:14,400
okay what's the answer this is two

133
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:16,500
million a million yeah and how about if

134
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,419
I want to pick two minion and one what's

135
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,580
the answer

136
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:22,860
that's right yeah okay so we can do this

137
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:25,620
if else right

138
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:27,720
and check if this K is smaller than one

139
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:30,600
if K is smaller than this number right

140
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:33,120
let's make it all okay just to to be

141
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,440
different than this number one if K is

142
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,840
smaller than o

143
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:39,060
then we do 10K otherwise we need to pick

144
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:42,539
all the O's

145
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:44,819
and we still have K minus o

146
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:46,380
numbers to pick right I know we have to

147
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:49,740
compare this number

148
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:52,319
to this to this Z right

149
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:54,180
and if it's more than that then we have

150
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,819
to pick the minus one right

151
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:58,080
does it make sense

152
00:06:55,819 --> 00:07:00,180
not really anything right you have too

153
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,639
many effects how about if I tell you

154
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:05,039
this away here all right minus one minus

155
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:09,020
one minus one minus one all right and

156
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:12,180
zero zero zero zero and one one one one

157
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:15,479
okay so now a lot you know how many of

158
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:18,860
these right this is n times this is z

159
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:18,860
times and this is

160
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:25,020
yeah this is a possibly three numbers

161
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:27,300
only three numbers I mean if you want to

162
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:29,580
pick K so which side are you going to

163
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:32,940
pick we want to pick the K numbers

164
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:34,800
pick from the right yes so okay so this

165
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:36,300
is the array right I don't want to just

166
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,180
pick a

167
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:43,139
from here we want to pick K items so how

168
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:45,419
do we write it minus K to the end

169
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:48,180
and we just need to return some of it

170
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:50,759
sum only 10 summer return

171
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:54,479
so how do we get this a we notice three

172
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:55,380
numbers right so a equals n times minus

173
00:07:54,479 --> 00:08:01,199
one

174
00:07:55,380 --> 00:08:01,940
plus c times zero plus

175
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,840
plus

176
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:06,660
o times

177
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:09,599
one right okay so we construct this and

178
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:12,960
we do 10 this and obviously K if K is

179
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:15,060
zero we have to check otherwise it will

180
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,800
not work right because if k equals zero

181
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,660
minus zero equals zero and you will

182
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,539
return the sum of everything which is

183
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:24,120
currently lonely answer so we have to

184
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:26,759
check if k equals zero then we can zero

185
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,740
otherwise return at least bit right the

186
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:31,800
times the next day for this one check

187
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:33,899
this one the time complexity position

188
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,719
we have to construct the speed right and

189
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:39,000
we have to do this right so the time

190
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:42,779
complexity is all

191
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,959
this n plus Z Plus o

192
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:48,420
and plus KK obviously is smaller than

193
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:50,120
this term so we can drop it so it's all

194
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:52,620
this one right

195
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,180
because we

196
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,740
wait and we wanted to pick the numbers

197
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:58,980
from the right hand side do you get it

198
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:01,560
yes okay another way another way is

199
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:04,080
simpler but it's harder to think about

200
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:06,120
let me write it here and you tell me you

201
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,620
explain to me okay return

202
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,980
I mean

203
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:14,220
okay I will number of ones

204
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:17,640
okay one k minus one

205
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:20,519
minus zero okay and that's it

206
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:25,760
but this bit this one

207
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:25,760
okay obviously why you you guys

208
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:29,839
it's masculine yes

209
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:36,720
concise okay yeah this is the maximum

210
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:39,839
what this is the maximum you can get the

211
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:42,120
ones if ones is more obviously your

212
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,420
return okay if K is more you return once

213
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,980
yes this is two minutes that's a cool

214
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:49,800
question let's take a look at that later

215
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:52,140
I'm saying this this one just once this

216
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:54,779
is the ones we can get right if this is

217
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:57,000
two million this is a hundred obviously

218
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:58,980
return 100 if this is three million this

219
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,279
is two million obviously less than two

220
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:04,560
million all right

221
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:07,980
okay so now we pick the ones

222
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:11,820
now we need to pick the zeros if K if K

223
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:14,580
is smaller or equal than once plus zeros

224
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:16,140
it doesn't change right if it's more

225
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:19,320
than that then we have to pick the

226
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:21,600
negative ones right am I right yeah

227
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,820
this is the thing to pick the negative

228
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,740
one and obviously it's smaller than zero

229
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:29,459
then we don't have to pick okay

230
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:31,920
yeah I do notice here there is no even

231
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:34,680
mentioning about the negative ones

232
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,720
because we don't need to use the value

233
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,339
does it make sense

234
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,820
a tiny bit which pick if you don't

235
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:44,100
understand I don't really answer

236
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:46,820
so this is the picking once right I

237
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:49,920
don't really understand the canines

238
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:52,579
that's a good question K minus one but

239
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:56,220
you understand this bit right yeah

240
00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:58,140
yes and you pick the ones and then you

241
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:00,240
subtract you need to subtract what in

242
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:03,060
what cases does the answer change

243
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,560
if we haven't reached the step to pick

244
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:07,320
negative one it doesn't change right

245
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:10,440
yeah because if there are enough zeros

246
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:12,600
it doesn't change right so K minus ones

247
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:16,019
because we have to pick ones yeah bless

248
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:18,779
you look K minus minus one we have pick

249
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:20,579
ones yeah and then when you want to pick

250
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:23,399
the zeros right

251
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:25,680
and if we pick pick the ones and pick

252
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:28,700
the zero if this number is still bigger

253
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,700
than zero what does it mean

254
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,279
yeah yeah

255
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:37,079
it doesn't change the answer right

256
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:38,220
because here Max is yellow here if this

257
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:42,060
is negative

258
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:44,700
this bit is zero minus zero is zero only

259
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:45,420
if this number is like two what does it

260
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,300
mean

261
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:49,440
s

262
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:51,360
yeah because we need to pick two

263
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,920
negative ones right yes

264
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,180
there's no negative

265
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,180
oh that's a good question

266
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:05,100
okay smaller than equal than once plus

267
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:07,560
zeros plus negative one right yeah

268
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,060
if this is zero

269
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:12,060
yeah

270
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:15,420
if this is zero K will be ones and zero

271
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:18,779
so if this is zero so what happened K

272
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:20,880
minus ones minus zeros smaller than

273
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:22,620
equal to zero so what does it mean this

274
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,779
is smaller than zero then this bit is

275
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:27,360
zero because that's additional time

276
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:29,579
because that's very good makes sense

277
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,000
okay that's very good okay so what have

278
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:32,000
you learned today

279
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:41,519
we learned about this we have K back the

280
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:44,940
three bears and we want to find

281
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:48,600
okay the maximum number you could get it

282
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:49,620
and exactly K numbers of the amount of

283
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,920
the bag

284
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:53,639
yeah what's the strategy basically we

285
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:57,360
like

286
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:59,940
get the ones and then and then if they

287
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:04,139
decays more we have to go to the zeros

288
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:06,180
so if it's still more we have to we have

289
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:08,700
to go to the negatives

290
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:12,860
use the negative level what's the time

291
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:12,860
complexity for this one if there's like

292
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,160
nothing

293
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:22,500
zero zero zero yeah yeah then K must be

294
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,399
zero because that's the additional

295
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,760
requirement

296
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:29,540
K is smaller than equivalent zero so K

297
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:34,459
is a positive number so K is a zero uh

298
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:34,459
number okay what's the time complexity

299
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,420
um

300
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:39,420
oh

301
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:46,560
Wow Come on under this number right then

302
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,560
remember

303
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,820
what's the number I should put here okay

304
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:56,360
what should I put here

305
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,360
okay

306
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:00,660
come on what's the time of last day

307
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:03,420
we're just doing this mess what's up

308
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:05,940
remember this one remember what did I

309
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:08,100
say what number should I play right

310
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:10,620
number not a letter

311
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:13,320
yeah I saw one right because we're just

312
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:14,120
doing Real mess yes this makes sense no

313
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:18,360
okay

314
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:21,500
if you say no I'm gonna repeat okay okay

315
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,500
thank you bye-bye
