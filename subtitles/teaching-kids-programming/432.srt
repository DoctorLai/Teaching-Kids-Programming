1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,440
go hello guys

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:08,480
okay so we have two arrays of integers

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,280
here one two three two four six

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,480
so

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,400
one three and four six okay so one three

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,480
are the numbers in first array but do

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,880
not appear on the second array 4 6 is

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,119
the number from the second array which

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,039
do not appear in the first array okay so

10
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,720
how do we find it how do we return these

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,080
two

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,480
arrays yeah

13
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,519
how to how to return this data yeah so

14
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,679
anything

15
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,239
this is supposed to be an easy question

16
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,840
so what what what data structure can we

17
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,640
use to do that

18
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,840
okay

19
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,399
okay

20
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,600
so one two three we convert it to a set

21
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,399
so

22
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,879
and then two four six okay so one two

23
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,440
three i put one three

24
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:52,559
two four six right

25
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,160
yeah so from this set we can say easy

26
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,120
see one and three

27
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:00,480
yeah it's outside of this set yep four

28
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,120
and six outside of these okay so

29
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,239
so we can just do this yeah so look

30
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,400
uh

31
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,760
so we can do this difference okay so for

32
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,760
example like c uh

33
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,520
let's say let's convert it to set okay

34
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,840
set

35
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:19,040
we converted that

36
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,920
now we can just return what a 1 3 is

37
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:25,840
actually a minus b right

38
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:29,200
and 4 6 is actually b minus a right so

39
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,720
all we need to do is just return

40
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,680
return

41
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,000
uh list of we converted the set into a

42
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,520
list at least a minus b

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,880
and this

44
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,720
b minus a okay

45
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,119
so look at a minus b

46
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,640
yeah when we're talking about set a

47
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:51,119
minus b is actually the same as a dot

48
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,720
different okay because we are going to

49
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,040
check the difference different it's the

50
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,360
same thing yeah different

51
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,640
a dot difference b this is the same

52
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,719
thing okay

53
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,360
and actually we can use if we're not

54
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:06,159
using set we can we can

55
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,680
we can directly check which numbers up

56
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,360
on the first array but to not appear on

57
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,120
the second array so how do we do this we

58
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,360
can just say we can

59
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,040
yeah uh

60
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,720
uh

61
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,480
eric right cool

62
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,280
so we can say

63
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,319
x

64
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:25,520
for

65
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:26,640
x in a right in a

66
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:31,040
if

67
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:34,000
x not in b yeah look

68
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:37,440
like who knows right right look we can

69
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,560
just do this x for x in a if not if x

70
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,879
not in b

71
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,560
and then to make it faster we convert

72
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:47,040
this uh to the set set a and set b yeah

73
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,440
exactly and the opposite

74
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,400
x for x in b

75
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,200
yeah

76
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,280
if x not in a right doesn't make sense

77
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,690
yes okay so

78
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,040
so which way do you think it's better

79
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:00,959
[Music]

80
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,879
converting to set or we just directly

81
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,480
using this one return

82
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,720
return we can just return this thing

83
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,680
yeah pretend these things i think that

84
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,319
yes

85
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,840
set is more straightforward right

86
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:15,040
that's not in

87
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,840
okay so for this is easy too look we can

88
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:21,120
just read it look we want to return x

89
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,159
for x what's x x is in p right

90
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,799
right

91
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,000
and we add one more condition if x not

92
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,920
in there right

93
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,840
yeah if we write it in python it's quite

94
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,840
easy to understand all right yeah do you

95
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,080
understand

96
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,959
it okay and then convert into set it's

97
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,799
easy a what's a dot difference b what

98
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,080
else does it mean angle difference b

99
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,640
what's it

100
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,480
what's it it means the difference i got

101
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,400
different speed is what here the

102
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,599
difference between a

103
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,360
and b okay so look this is a this is b

104
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,439
ain't no difference b

105
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,879
once you eat with 10

106
00:03:53,439 --> 00:04:00,560
8 different three yeah one three

107
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:02,640
and b top difference a what's in

108
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,159
about difference b is actually the seven

109
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,360
a minus b okay

110
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:10,720
b dot difference a is what

111
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,720
what beta difference a

112
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:17,199
is this same as b minus a okay yeah when

113
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,440
b and a are set okay

114
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:23,199
contains the unique integer unique

115
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,639
element yeah this is what a set is okay

116
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,400
yeah make sense

117
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,840
any questions so far

118
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,840
okay that's it for today bye
