1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,200
hello mr mr right now all right

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,960
okay give it a positive integer number

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,440
we want to find out a list of factors

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,360
right for example 12. 2 times 6

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:15,839
3 times 4 2 times 2 times 3 okay

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,160
so the order of the factors do not

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,279
matter so 2 times 6 is the same as 6

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,840
times 2.

9
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,519
3 times 4 is the same as 4 times 3.

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,119
okay and the factors i can see that

11
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,480
bigger than 2 or equal than 2 and

12
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,279
smaller than n

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,119
okay look this is close this is open is

14
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,760
the same thing as the factor bigger or

15
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,280
equal than 2 and smaller than n okay

16
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,440
n equals 1

17
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,000
return empty because we can't find such

18
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,879
factor bigger than 2 smaller than n n

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,719
equals 2 return empty this is a very

20
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:47,280
special case here and equals two bigger

21
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:50,399
than two smaller than two we can't we

22
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,600
don't find such factors n equals five is

23
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,000
five

24
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,840
a prime number yes okay what's a prime

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,719
number it's a number that i only can

26
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,079
divided by one on itself okay one at the

27
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,160
exam okay

28
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,119
one and itself so

29
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,200
does this satisfy this requirement no

30
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,280
okay so for any prime numbers what do we

31
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,520
need to return nothing nothing empty

32
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:15,680
this okay another example

33
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,920
n equals 13 what's your return

34
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,840
exactly okay what's your thoughts about

35
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,159
these

36
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,960
two if it's a prime number

37
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,640
and if it is

38
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,119
okay if it's a prime number and yeah

39
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,280
yeah yeah obviously point number is one

40
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,680
of the test cases

41
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,079
but for these for the long prime numbers

42
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,119
like 12 how do we get these answers any

43
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,600
ideas

44
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,600
you just

45
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:51,200
yes okay two

46
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,720
three and two two three two

47
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,680
two three two is the same as two two

48
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,560
three

49
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,799
so

50
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,439
yeah two two three two is the same as

51
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,680
two two three so one way to avoid

52
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:04,479
duplicate these are difficult is that we

53
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,079
always treat the factors increasing yes

54
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:09,039
strictly

55
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:12,560
non-decreasing okay three four two two

56
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:14,720
three okay if we solve the factors

57
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,200
then there will be only one right two

58
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,360
two three two c two after something will

59
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:23,560
be all two two three okay all three two

60
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,560
two this this is

61
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,920
yeah because we cannot find such vectors

62
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,200
okay

63
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,000
yeah

64
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,400
so

65
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,120
we we can have many ways to solve this

66
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,920
problem one way is to prefer search yeah

67
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,760
i need cube yeah using q or we can

68
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,920
backtracking that's using data search

69
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,319
backtracking how do we backtrack so

70
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:47,680
every time we check with the

71
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:51,040
we have released that bfs yeah so first

72
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,040
of all the current integer remaining

73
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,360
and then the

74
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,760
in order to avoid duplicate this is the

75
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,599
standard backtracking problem you know

76
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,319
in order to avoid duplicating we keep

77
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,879
tracking of the last factor used okay so

78
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:07,440
for example if we we are using the last

79
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,120
track uh factor we're using is three so

80
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,040
the next one we pick

81
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,879
should be

82
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,720
three or more right

83
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,840
yeah we don't pick two

84
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,720
right because three two

85
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,519
2 will be covered by two three okay make

86
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,080
sense

87
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:28,879
yeah so this s is the last factor we use

88
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,959
so we use this we keep tracking of this

89
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,599
factor to

90
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:36,080
uh to incrementally you know to

91
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,720
incrementally build our

92
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,519
list of factors so this is the currently

93
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,200
so

94
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,040
with this backtracking we use the three

95
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,840
parameters the current and the current

96
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,640
integer

97
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:51,200
remaining the s the last used factor and

98
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,519
then c the current list of factors okay

99
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,760
so remember when we check about prime

100
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,080
numbers yeah how do we check if it's a

101
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,400
prime number for example how do we check

102
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,519
if the 12 is the prime number if it's a

103
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,280
number

104
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,159
how do we check normally how do you

105
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,400
usually check i check the

106
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,560
last digit and see if it's an even

107
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,879
number but how about two

108
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,360
yeah yeah okay so okay so for example

109
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:17,040
like 39. the two is a prime number two

110
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,959
is the prime number yeah that's good

111
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,720
yeah i haven't even finished my sentence

112
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,560
okay that's fine yeah okay

113
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,720
so

114
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,240
nice

115
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,840
any even numbers except two are not

116
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,680
prime number two is the very special

117
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,440
case two is the only even number there

118
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,440
is the time number okay how about 139 is

119
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,479
it the prime number

120
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,280
um

121
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:43,040
yes no no no no what is that three

122
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:46,000
tables three and nine okay okay so how

123
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,880
do we check if 13 39 is a per number

124
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,880
usually i mean how do you check i i just

125
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,120
remember it you just remember how about

126
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,400
how do i need the calculator your

127
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,280
calculator

128
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,840
i get a calculator by using the hydrogen

129
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,320
how do you check if it's 39 39 divided

130
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:05,919
by any number okay so you try yeah you

131
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:08,160
try with two if it's an even number okay

132
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,800
i divided by two i can see it's thirty

133
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,520
and thirty then the

134
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,160
because three plus nine is twelve and

135
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,160
one plus two is three where then where

136
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,320
yeah that's the way to check if the

137
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,240
number can be divisible by three okay

138
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,919
you add all the digits right we talked

139
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,720
about this before right we add all the

140
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:28,880
digital prove it mathematically why why

141
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,479
the number if we add all the digit and

142
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,400
then all the teacher can be divided by

143
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,720
three then the number itself can be

144
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,600
divided but what i'm talking about is

145
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,639
that

146
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:41,360
let's say i give a very

147
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:44,310
complex number i don't know maybe

148
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,840
121 is that problem

149
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:48,880
[Music]

150
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:52,880
no what is that because i remember it

151
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,880
in 11 times table i thought my time

152
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,759
how do we check if for example if you

153
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,199
don't know if it's in 11 times table how

154
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,960
do we check

155
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,639
you just go okay it's not an even number

156
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,720
so you don't divide by two okay you

157
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,120
check if it's a three times table if

158
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,680
it's four times table if it's five times

159
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:20,000
label right so okay so

160
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:23,280
it's it's a three digit number yeah so

161
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,240
so uh did you visit him so i asked

162
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,400
google

163
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:30,720
yeah oh alexa

164
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,759
yeah hi alexa is 121 the prime number

165
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,039
okay

166
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,039
she come here

167
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,479
okay

168
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,800
okay so for even numbers we can easily

169
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,560
rule out the even numbers except two are

170
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,880
no problem

171
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,599
for this number okay three you see in

172
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,639
three times seven no is it in five times

173
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,360
table

174
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,960
no

175
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,800
if it's in seven times table we don't

176
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,039
check the even numbers anymore because

177
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,199
we know it's it's not um right so we

178
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,680
don't check four and six because let's

179
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:04,400
point this am i right yeah so we skip

180
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,720
two three five seven nine

181
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,720
eleven okay okay eleven it can be

182
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,000
divided so it's not a prime number easy

183
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:15,039
okay but the thing is that a number we

184
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,560
we don't check up to how how big

185
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,440
how that's the number we need to check

186
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,280
if

187
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,440
in general okay this is the question we

188
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,520
talked about that before if a number is

189
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,520
n

190
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,960
the factors how many factors we need to

191
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,000
check

192
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,560
from 2 up to what

193
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,039
do you still remember from two up to one

194
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,319
if the number is n from two up to one

195
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,800
and

196
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,080
do you need to check up to n

197
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,560
half n

198
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,759
half n is a good guess yeah because out

199
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,960
of half we found

200
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,039
by two

201
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,360
yeah the half half and that's a good

202
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:51,199
guess but we still can make it

203
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,720
make it listen this is the make it

204
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:58,120
better

205
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:58,120
square root and why is that a hundred

206
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:04,960
we just have to check up to 10 why is

207
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:06,080
that look if we have a vector 5 a 2

208
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,039
so the

209
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,319
corresponding will be 50 right yeah

210
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,199
you see

211
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,800
yeah so if we have a 5 corresponding

212
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,840
will be 20.

213
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,160
correct

214
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:21,840
if we have 10 corresponding will be 10

215
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:23,120
right so look going on 20

216
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,160
5

217
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:29,120
you see 2 times 20 20 times 5

218
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,039
is the same so we just check up to 10

219
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,519
which is the square root let's make sure

220
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,640
that's 2 times 50.

221
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,880
okay okay

222
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,760
2 times 50 okay okay look at those 50

223
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,760
times 2 okay

224
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,600
does it make sense here yeah yeah so we

225
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,000
just have to check up to 10 which is the

226
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,880
square root square root of n

227
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,320
so this is obviously faster yeah square

228
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,680
root of n

229
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,600
is smaller or equal than n divided by 2a

230
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,880
when we talk about a complexity time

231
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,040
conduction this is linear oh and divided

232
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,760
by 2 is linear

233
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,760
okay we drop the constant

234
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,399
okay so let's let's see what i'm saying

235
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,880
here

236
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,880
so we just have to go through the

237
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,399
factors from s

238
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,480
here

239
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,519
square root of n okay and then we can

240
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,120
check

241
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,120
we can check

242
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,959
we can backtrack okay and then we append

243
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,959
this as okay i'm going to just quickly

244
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:27,519
divide this okay

245
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,360
you see define n s c okay and then we

246
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,720
have this answer somewhere answer equals

247
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,760
empty list

248
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,200
for

249
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:37,600
the factor i in range

250
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,680
we start from s yeah look we start from

251
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,680
s up to

252
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,760
square root of n okay square root of n

253
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,640
plus one so how do we implement this

254
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:49,519
square root of n in python

255
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:52,000
three ways one way

256
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,200
in integer buyer we get an integer bar

257
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,120
with n

258
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,560
w double star

259
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,480
0.5

260
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,640
okay

261
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,920
okay do you still remember this double

262
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,720
multiple is the exponential

263
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,839
x

264
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,440
y

265
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,079
x to the power of y

266
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,720
in person we can write it as x

267
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:14,320
times times y

268
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,279
x y

269
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:20,480
or

270
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:22,640
or we can write it as power x y okay

271
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,519
yeah this is also okay

272
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:28,800
yeah if it's zero function square root

273
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:31,519
of n we can write it also as s q r t

274
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:34,399
this is the function square root

275
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:36,240
solution one square root okay if it is

276
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,560
square root okay here

277
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,560
and what can i do

278
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,120
what do we do now

279
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,760
so we have to check if n

280
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,640
modulus i equal equals what does this

281
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,360
mean

282
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,519
anybody tell me percentage and modulus i

283
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:56,240
equal equals what does it mean

284
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:58,880
it means that if i is divided by n

285
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,839
put it in other words if i is a factor

286
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:06,240
of and right yeah so what do we get if i

287
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:09,040
is affected first of all c dot append

288
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:12,320
so this is the current list open i right

289
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:14,480
and then the answer answer that append

290
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,480
we

291
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,600
we make a copy and

292
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,880
n

293
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,959
divided by i okay so look if we have a

294
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,360
factor i

295
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:29,680
we have another factor n divided by i

296
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,079
okay and then we do that to the

297
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,240
backpacking okay so this is look

298
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:37,360
we have the factor i so what's the

299
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,200
remaining if we if n and now i'm

300
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,839
training we have a vector i so what's

301
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,240
the

302
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:45,920
remaining 12 and we know we have a two

303
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:50,320
so what's the remaining

304
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:53,279
six yeah so n divided by i all right

305
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,120
the next factor we are using i the next

306
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,360
vector should be more

307
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,639
should be equal or more

308
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,320
than i so we put i and the current list

309
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:05,360
will be c

310
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,480
okay and then here we need to restore

311
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,680
the

312
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:13,120
currently electric and if we do this

313
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:15,040
that such we start with and the smallest

314
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,519
vector should be is two

315
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,880
and then the current this will be empty

316
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,920
at the beginning we don't have any

317
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,360
seconds

318
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:25,360
this this is to put the i

319
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,839
it to the c so this is the same thing as

320
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,639
c plus equal i this is the same thing

321
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:33,440
okay this one this is the make a copy of

322
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,519
c so we can also do this deep copy

323
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,480
deep copy

324
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,440
copy

325
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:42,320
r c or we can convert it to a list see

326
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:45,040
this is also the same backtracking we

327
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,360
have a factor i so the remaining will be

328
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:50,800
n divided by i we we are using the

329
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,959
vector i so the next factor should be i

330
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,800
or more right and we're changing the

331
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,880
list because we're backtracking we are

332
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,880
changing the list here

333
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,839
so means after backtracking we need to

334
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:05,040
restore c dot pop what's c dot

335
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:09,040
two three the pop what happened if c

336
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:10,639
equals bad then c dot top will happen

337
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,959
it pops

338
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,040
three yeah so c will become two right

339
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:17,600
because what look three

340
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,200
is a pen here as

341
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,639
i

342
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,639
three is a pen to see if i is three

343
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,920
right and then after backtracking needs

344
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,320
to restore it

345
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,240
okay so this is backtracking

346
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,639
okay so what have you learned today

347
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,279
about factors okay what's the problem

348
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:38,160
and how are we solving this problem

349
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:39,360
the problem is well what's the problem

350
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,720
come on

351
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,600
ryan

352
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,199
then

353
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,279
yeah we're given the integer positive

354
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,720
integer and what are we trying to do is

355
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,959
we try

356
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,120
we factorize it yeah we're trying to

357
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:53,040
find a list of factors yeah

358
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,279
and you know how do we solve the problem

359
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,600
of the duplication

360
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,839
for example we solve the factor of

361
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,560
duplication like 2 2 3

362
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,880
is the same as 2 3 2. come on can

363
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,560
anybody tell me how do we

364
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,880
using this approach how do we solve the

365
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:11,519
problem multiplication you know we just

366
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,199
find 2 3 or not 2 3 2 because 2 3 2 is

367
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:16,639
the same as 2 3

368
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:18,320
which parameters controls the 2g3 yeah

369
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:22,000
which parameter look

370
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:24,079
controls the used last used factor

371
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,120
s that's where

372
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:29,120
n is the current remaining s is the last

373
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,720
use factor yeah

374
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,600
yeah c is the common list of factors

375
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,360
right

376
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,800
okay that's checking okay that's it for

377
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,800
today bye bye

378
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,800
bye
