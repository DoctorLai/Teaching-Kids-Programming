[Music]
 

33
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,910
[Music]
okay let's see so if we give the ranking

34
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:13,920
okay let's see so if we give the ranking
 

35
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,149
okay let's see so if we give the ranking
we sort it from the top uh for the

36
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:16,159
we sort it from the top uh for the
 

37
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,350
we sort it from the top uh for the
highest to the lowest what are those

38
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:19,360
highest to the lowest what are those
 

39
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,550
highest to the lowest what are those
100 100 100 150

40
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:22,560
100 100 100 150
 

41
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,550
100 100 100 150
60 19 16 50.

42
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:26,560
60 19 16 50.
 

43
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,030
60 19 16 50.
okay so if we put a ranking for each

44
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:29,040
okay so if we put a ranking for each
 

45
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,190
okay so if we put a ranking for each
score okay so look if the ranking the

46
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:31,200
score okay so look if the ranking the
 

47
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,550
score okay so look if the ranking the
top is is zero so we'll put a zero here

48
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:34,560
top is is zero so we'll put a zero here
 

49
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,630
top is is zero so we'll put a zero here
at least one should be one right and

50
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:36,640
at least one should be one right and
 

51
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,990
at least one should be one right and
then two

52
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:38,000
then two
 

53
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,270
then two
three

54
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:39,280
three
 

55
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,910
three
okay two three that i don't know can you

56
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:41,920
okay two three that i don't know can you
 

57
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,990
okay two three that i don't know can you
please not put it we got 1 000.

58
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,000
please not put it we got 1 000.
 

59
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,230
please not put it we got 1 000.
so the ranking this is the ranking this

60
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:48,240
so the ranking this is the ranking this
 

61
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,910
so the ranking this is the ranking this
is the ranking

62
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:49,920
is the ranking
 

63
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,670
is the ranking
this is a special ranking that it does

64
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:51,680
this is a special ranking that it does
 

65
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,910
this is a special ranking that it does
not take us it does not consider how

66
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:53,920
not take us it does not consider how
 

67
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,270
not take us it does not consider how
many people are

68
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:55,280
many people are
 

69
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,950
many people are
uh before right for example

70
00:01:58,950 --> 00:01:58,960
uh before right for example
 

71
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,830
uh before right for example
this 90 is actually in the third place

72
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:01,840
this 90 is actually in the third place
 

73
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,510
this 90 is actually in the third place
right because there are two

74
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:03,520
right because there are two
 

75
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,310
right because there are two
hundred in front of you know in front of

76
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:06,320
hundred in front of you know in front of
 

77
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,350
hundred in front of you know in front of
90.

78
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:07,360
90.
 

79
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,350
90.
but we're only considering the

80
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:09,360
but we're only considering the
 

81
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,830
but we're only considering the
the numbers right so the 100 should be

82
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:11,840
the numbers right so the 100 should be
 

83
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,550
the numbers right so the 100 should be
ranked at zero and then 90 should be the

84
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:14,560
ranked at zero and then 90 should be the
 

85
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,309
ranked at zero and then 90 should be the
rank at one

86
00:02:16,309 --> 00:02:16,319
rank at one
 

87
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,350
rank at one
okay

88
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:17,360
okay
 

89
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,430
okay
so how do we do this

90
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:19,440
so how do we do this
 

91
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,710
so how do we do this
everywhere any sauce how do we do this

92
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:22,720
everywhere any sauce how do we do this
 

93
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,790
everywhere any sauce how do we do this
what do you mean

94
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:24,800
what do you mean
 

95
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,790
what do you mean
dictionary yeah yeah

96
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:26,800
dictionary yeah yeah
 

97
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,070
dictionary yeah yeah
but first of all we need to do one thing

98
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:30,080
but first of all we need to do one thing
 

99
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,150
but first of all we need to do one thing
before sorting set

100
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:32,160
before sorting set
 

101
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,589
before sorting set
what's that

102
00:02:33,589 --> 00:02:33,599
what's that
 

103
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,710
what's that
look at

104
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:34,720
look at
 

105
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,390
look at
what do we need to do

106
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:36,400
what do we need to do
 

107
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,470
what do we need to do
we need to basically

108
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:38,480
we need to basically
 

109
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,270
we need to basically
okay

110
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:39,280
okay
 

111
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,589
okay
so basically we want to come up with at

112
00:02:41,589 --> 00:02:41,599
so basically we want to come up with at
 

113
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,229
so basically we want to come up with at
least the score and the ranking paper

114
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:44,239
least the score and the ranking paper
 

115
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,949
least the score and the ranking paper
right so we want to have a slot uh rank

116
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:46,959
right so we want to have a slot uh rank
 

117
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,190
right so we want to have a slot uh rank
uh let's go to the ranking table so

118
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:49,200
uh let's go to the ranking table so
 

119
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,910
uh let's go to the ranking table so
hundreds you might be mapped to zero 90

120
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:51,920
hundreds you might be mapped to zero 90
 

121
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,470
hundreds you might be mapped to zero 90
will be mapped to one sixty should be

122
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:54,480
will be mapped to one sixty should be
 

123
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,190
will be mapped to one sixty should be
mapped to two this is so bad and three

124
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:57,200
mapped to two this is so bad and three
 

125
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,270
mapped to two this is so bad and three
no zero means the top

126
00:02:59,270 --> 00:02:59,280
no zero means the top
 

127
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,350
no zero means the top
three uh uh

128
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:01,360
three uh uh
 

129
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,750
three uh uh
fifty should be ranked two three okay so

130
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:03,760
fifty should be ranked two three okay so
 

131
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,630
fifty should be ranked two three okay so
in order to do this look at this side

132
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:06,640
in order to do this look at this side
 

133
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,589
in order to do this look at this side
look at this side

134
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:09,599

 

135
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,430

i look at the original numbers what's

136
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:11,440
i look at the original numbers what's
 

137
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,630
i look at the original numbers what's
the difference

138
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:12,640
the difference
 

139
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,910
the difference
what's the difference between these and

140
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:13,920
what's the difference between these and
 

141
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,190
what's the difference between these and
this

142
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:15,200
this
 

143
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,830
this
can you find the difference

144
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:16,840
can you find the difference
 

145
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,350
can you find the difference
here 196 to 50 and 19650 what's the

146
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:21,360
here 196 to 50 and 19650 what's the
 

147
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,170
here 196 to 50 and 19650 what's the
difference

148
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:22,180
difference
 

149
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:27,509

153
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,789
no no no no i'm not looking for the
visual difference i'm looking for the

154
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:30,799
visual difference i'm looking for the
 

155
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:36,789
visual difference i'm looking for the
actual difference 100 195 60.

156
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:36,799

 

157
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,350

00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:58,640
we have this b
 

169
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,949
we have this b
which has only the unique numbers but

170
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:00,959
which has only the unique numbers but
 

171
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,789
which has only the unique numbers but
now we want to

172
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:02,799
now we want to
 

173
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,309
now we want to
sort it right

174
00:04:04,309 --> 00:04:04,319
sort it right
 

175
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,309
sort it right
yeah what's the term complex to solve

176
00:04:06,309 --> 00:04:06,319
yeah what's the term complex to solve
 

177
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,070
yeah what's the term complex to solve
the way

178
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:08,080
the way
 

179
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,830
the way
what's the time complexity to sorry all

180
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:09,840
what's the time complexity to sorry all
 

181
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,789
what's the time complexity to sorry all
right

182
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:10,799
right
 

183
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:11,990
right
um

184
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:12,000
um
 

185
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:21,509
um
this is

186
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:21,519

 

187
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,270

oh yeah and what's the

188
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:23,280
oh yeah and what's the
 

189
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,469
oh yeah and what's the
so this number if we saw the numbers

190
00:04:26,469 --> 00:04:26,479
so this number if we saw the numbers
 

191
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,070
so this number if we saw the numbers
look at if p does soft

192
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:30,080
look at if p does soft
 

193
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,150
look at if p does soft
so that will give us what

194
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,160
so that will give us what
 

195
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,350
so that will give us what
50

196
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:33,360
50
 

197
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,550
50
60

198
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:34,560
60
 

199
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,230
60
90 100. but we what we want is from the

200
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:38,240
90 100. but we what we want is from the
 

201
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,150
90 100. but we what we want is from the
highest to the smallest

202
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,160
highest to the smallest
 

203
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,150
highest to the smallest
right we don't want to we want to change

204
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:42,160
right we don't want to we want to change
 

205
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,150
right we don't want to we want to change
the usb order so how do we solve this

206
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:44,160
the usb order so how do we solve this
 

207
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,430
the usb order so how do we solve this
already

208
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:45,440
already
 

209
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,550
already
okay so b

210
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:46,560
okay so b
 

211
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,230
okay so b
and we put in the reverse keyword right

212
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:48,240
and we put in the reverse keyword right
 

213
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,909
and we put in the reverse keyword right
reverse equals two

214
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:49,919
reverse equals two
 

215
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,590
reverse equals two
and then it will give us a hundred

216
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:51,600
and then it will give us a hundred
 

217
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,390
and then it will give us a hundred
ninety sixty fifty okay so now this is

218
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:54,400
ninety sixty fifty okay so now this is
 

219
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,230
ninety sixty fifty okay so now this is
160 90 60 50 and how do we get the

220
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:58,240
160 90 60 50 and how do we get the
 

221
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,670
160 90 60 50 and how do we get the
ranking which is also the index we use

222
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:01,680
ranking which is also the index we use
 

223
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,070
ranking which is also the index we use
what kind of function set

224
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,080
what kind of function set
 

225
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,990
what kind of function set
you're not saying keep saying that what

226
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:06,000
you're not saying keep saying that what
 

227
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,110
you're not saying keep saying that what
dictionary

228
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:09,120

 

229
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,070

the is gives you the

230
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:12,080
the is gives you the
 

231
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,230
the is gives you the
the index and the value okay and then

232
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:14,240
the index and the value okay and then
 

233
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,469
the index and the value okay and then
with the index with the matching with

234
00:05:16,469 --> 00:05:16,479
with the index with the matching with
 

235
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,230
with the index with the matching with
the decimal mapping from the value to

236
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:18,240
the decimal mapping from the value to
 

237
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,110
the decimal mapping from the value to
the index which is the ranking then we

238
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:21,120
the index which is the ranking then we
 

239
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,469
the index which is the ranking then we
can construct the ranking array right i

240
00:05:24,469 --> 00:05:24,479
can construct the ranking array right i
 

241
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,790
can construct the ranking array right i
know that'll be it right okay let's try

242
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:26,800
know that'll be it right okay let's try

now we're going to do what ranking
 

339
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,749
now we're going to do what ranking
ranking one equals one can you tell me

340
00:07:21,749 --> 00:07:21,759
ranking one equals one can you tell me
 

341
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,830
ranking one equals one can you tell me
which one is the score

342
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:23,840
which one is the score
 

343
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,510
which one is the score
go to cap a

344
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:25,520
go to cap a
 

345
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,150
go to cap a
there is no error i only i i is the

346
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:28,160
there is no error i only i i is the
 

347
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,270
there is no error i only i i is the
index please let's go so ranking one v

348
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:31,280
index please let's go so ranking one v
 

349
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,430
index please let's go so ranking one v
equals one r yeah

350
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:33,440
equals one r yeah
 

351
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,350
equals one r yeah
and then now we want to construct like

352
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:35,360
and then now we want to construct like
 

353
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,629
and then now we want to construct like
rankings are equal answer equals this

354
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:38,639
rankings are equal answer equals this
 

355
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,710
rankings are equal answer equals this
and then we also go through the original

356
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:40,720
and then we also go through the original
 

357
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,189
and then we also go through the original
numbers right which is for r

358
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:43,199
numbers right which is for r
 

359
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,430
numbers right which is for r
in what or which one is the original

360
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:45,440
in what or which one is the original
 

361
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,150
in what or which one is the original
number

362
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:48,160

 

363
