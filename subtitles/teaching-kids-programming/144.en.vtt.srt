1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,230

hey hello hello mr with mr ryan how are

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:04,240
hey hello hello mr with mr ryan how are
 

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,110
hey hello hello mr with mr ryan how are
you today

4
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:05,120
you today
 

5
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,150
you today
good okay okay so today i will talk

6
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:08,160
good okay okay so today i will talk
 

7
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,430
good okay okay so today i will talk
about an interesting problem is called

8
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:11,440
about an interesting problem is called
 

9
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,910
about an interesting problem is called
integer break or split product so

10
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:13,920
integer break or split product so
 

11
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,550
integer break or split product so
basically given an integer like

12
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:16,560
basically given an integer like
 

13
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,990
basically given an integer like
seven yeah i'll give one seven so

14
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:22,000

 

15
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,950

so we want to split it like seven how

16
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:24,960
so we want to split it like seven how
 

17
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,950
so we want to split it like seven how
many ways you can split it you can

18
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:26,960
many ways you can split it you can
 

19
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,429
many ways you can split it you can
spread split it you can say one plus one

20
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:29,439
spread split it you can say one plus one
 

21
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:29,990
spread split it you can say one plus one
plus one

22
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:30,000
plus one
 

23
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,190
plus one
plus one plus one plus one plus one plus

24
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:33,200
plus one plus one plus one plus one plus
 

25
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,790
plus one plus one plus one plus one plus
one right seven ones yeah two

26
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:34,800
one right seven ones yeah two
 

27
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,630
one right seven ones yeah two
four six seven so the

28
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:38,640
four six seven so the
 

29
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,790
four six seven so the
the product you multiply all the one

30
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:40,800
the product you multiply all the one
 

31
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,869
the product you multiply all the one
together you give you the one right

32
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:42,879
together you give you the one right
 

33
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,590
together you give you the one right
okay you can do it as twos two plus two

34
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:45,600
okay you can do it as twos two plus two
 

35
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,029
okay you can do it as twos two plus two
plus two plus one

36
00:00:47,029 --> 00:00:47,039
plus two plus one
 

37
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,029
plus two plus one
and if you multiply all these numbers

38
00:00:49,029 --> 00:00:49,039
and if you multiply all these numbers
 

39
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,310
and if you multiply all these numbers
together you'll give me

40
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:50,320
together you'll give me
 

41
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,029
together you'll give me
the what uh it'll give me

42
00:00:55,029 --> 00:00:55,039
the what uh it'll give me
 

43
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,910
the what uh it'll give me
what what can we get one no no

44
00:00:59,910 --> 00:00:59,920
what what can we get one no no
 

45
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,630
what what can we get one no no
eight come on yes i know you can do it

46
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:02,640
eight come on yes i know you can do it
 

47
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,590
eight come on yes i know you can do it
in three and three and one

48
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:05,600
in three and three and one
 

49
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,390
in three and three and one
that will give you nine okay so any

50
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:08,400
that will give you nine okay so any
 

51
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,550
that will give you nine okay so any
other ways

52
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:10,560
other ways
 

53
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,390
other ways
yeah of course look you can do this at

54
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:12,400
yeah of course look you can do this at
 

55
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,710
yeah of course look you can do this at
two plus one plus one right

56
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:14,720
two plus one plus one right
 

57
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,469
two plus one plus one right
yeah that will give me eight right

58
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:18,479
yeah that will give me eight right
 

59
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,749
yeah that will give me eight right
yeah or three plus four will give me

60
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:23,759
yeah or three plus four will give me
 

61
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,190
yeah or three plus four will give me
12 right yeah yeah so this

62
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:27,200
12 right yeah yeah so this
 

63
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,310
12 right yeah yeah so this
is the optimal we want to maximize we

64
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:30,320
is the optimal we want to maximize we
 

65
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,990
is the optimal we want to maximize we
want to maximize the product by

66
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:32,000
want to maximize the product by
 

67
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,030
want to maximize the product by
splitting

68
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:33,040
splitting
 

69
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,710
splitting
the breaking the integer right look

70
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:36,720
the breaking the integer right look
 

71
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,030
the breaking the integer right look
any other ways we can do it i don't

72
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:39,040
any other ways we can do it i don't
 

73
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,590
any other ways we can do it i don't
think anyone bigger than that

74
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:41,600
think anyone bigger than that
 

75
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,749
think anyone bigger than that
how about three plus two plus two

76
00:01:45,749 --> 00:01:45,759
how about three plus two plus two
 

77
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,950
how about three plus two plus two
that's also 12 right yeah

78
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:48,960
that's also 12 right yeah
 

79
00:01:48,960 --> 00:02:01,350
that's also 12 right yeah
this is also okay yeah and

80
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:01,360

 

81
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,469

how about two and five two and five

82
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:04,479
how about two and five two and five
 

83
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,389
how about two and five two and five
let's give me ten right

84
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:06,399
let's give me ten right
 

85
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,430
let's give me ten right
this is another way right right yeah all

86
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:09,440
this is another way right right yeah all
 

87
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,389
this is another way right right yeah all
right yeah

88
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:10,399
right yeah
 

89
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,630
right yeah
okay so let's try another example let's

90
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:12,640
okay so let's try another example let's
 

91
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,309
okay so let's try another example let's
try another example remember

92
00:02:14,309 --> 00:02:14,319
try another example remember
 

93
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,030
try another example remember
this is optimum right just remember okay

94
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,040
this is optimum right just remember okay
 

95
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,670
this is optimum right just remember okay
let's try

96
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:17,680
let's try
 

97
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,750
let's try
another example like uh five okay

98
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:21,760
another example like uh five okay
 

99
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,869
another example like uh five okay
eleven i'll give you yeah okay

100
00:02:24,869 --> 00:02:24,879
eleven i'll give you yeah okay
 

101
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,750
eleven i'll give you yeah okay
five alright obviously you split into

102
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:27,760
five alright obviously you split into
 

103
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,070
five alright obviously you split into
all

104
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:28,080
all
 

105
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,670
all
ones it's not optimum because the

106
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:29,680
ones it's not optimum because the
 

107
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,270
ones it's not optimum because the
quarter is one right so we skip

108
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:31,280
quarter is one right so we skip
 

109
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,710
quarter is one right so we skip
skip that two plus three will give me

110
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:34,720
skip that two plus three will give me
 

111
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,150
skip that two plus three will give me
six two plus two plus one now give me

112
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:38,160
six two plus two plus one now give me
 

113
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,350
six two plus two plus one now give me
four

114
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:39,360
four
 

115
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,190
four
what another one what three plus

116
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:43,200
what another one what three plus
 

117
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,990
what another one what three plus
two give me six eight yes three plus two

118
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:46,000
two give me six eight yes three plus two
 

119
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,509
two give me six eight yes three plus two
plus three is the same

120
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:47,519
plus three is the same
 

121
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,550
plus three is the same
yeah how about four plus one

122
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:50,560
yeah how about four plus one
 

123
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,750
yeah how about four plus one
give me four okay all right

124
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:53,760
give me four okay all right
 

125
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,270
give me four okay all right
say this and this yeah so

126
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:57,280
say this and this yeah so
 

127
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,790
say this and this yeah so
so any idea how we doing this

128
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:02,800

 

129
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,589

we're using squeeze where down that's a

130
00:03:05,589 --> 00:03:05,599
we're using squeeze where down that's a
 

131
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,910
we're using squeeze where down that's a
good observation yes the three it's

132
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:07,920
good observation yes the three it's
 

133
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,430
good observation yes the three it's
optimum to

134
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:09,440
optimum to
 

135
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,030
optimum to
split into threes look because look

136
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,040
split into threes look because look
 

137
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,550
split into threes look because look
if i uh five right

138
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:16,560
if i uh five right
 

139
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,670
if i uh five right
if it's five we can split into two and

140
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:19,680
if it's five we can split into two and
 

141
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,670
if it's five we can split into two and
three which is the optimum right

142
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:21,680
three which is the optimum right
 

143
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,070
three which is the optimum right
because three is preferred right and

144
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:24,080
because three is preferred right and
 

145
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,509
because three is preferred right and
then the seven we should

146
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:25,519
then the seven we should
 

147
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,070
then the seven we should
split into three and then four right and

148
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:28,080
split into three and then four right and
 

149
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,990
split into three and then four right and
three and three until look at this three

150
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:30,000
three and three until look at this three
 

151
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,030
three and three until look at this three
and four because

152
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,040
and four because
 

153
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,830
and four because
4 so we can split we can give a 3

154
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:35,840
4 so we can split we can give a 3
 

155
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,270
4 so we can split we can give a 3
and here until the remainder is less or

156
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:39,280
and here until the remainder is less or
 

157
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,869
and here until the remainder is less or
equal than 4 right

158
00:03:40,869 --> 00:03:40,879
equal than 4 right
 

159
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,030
equal than 4 right
that will be give the optimal right can

160
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:43,040
that will be give the optimal right can
 

161
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:58,830
that will be give the optimal right can
we try to write this problem

162
00:03:58,830 --> 00:03:58,840

 

163
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,229

if and look equals one

164
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:02,239
if and look equals one
 

165
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,869
if and look equals one
okay by the way for the integer we are

166
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:04,879
okay by the way for the integer we are
 

167
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,949
okay by the way for the integer we are
we're looking at

168
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:06,959
we're looking at
 

169
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,309
we're looking at
is the positive okay no yeah not yet

170
00:04:10,309 --> 00:04:10,319
is the positive okay no yeah not yet
 

171
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,990
is the positive okay no yeah not yet
no yeah oh and equals two so what's your

172
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:14,000
no yeah oh and equals two so what's your
 

173
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,550
no yeah oh and equals two so what's your
return if n equals one or n equals two

174
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:16,560
return if n equals one or n equals two
 

175
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,830
return if n equals one or n equals two
how many ways can you

176
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:17,840
how many ways can you
 

177
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,550
how many ways can you
can you uh one one yeah because there's

178
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:20,560
can you uh one one yeah because there's
 

179
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,189
can you uh one one yeah because there's
one is

180
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:21,199
one is
 

181
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,870
one is
you know you can't spell you can just

182
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:22,880
you know you can't spell you can just
 

183
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,189
you know you can't spell you can just
speak this one right one or two right

184
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:25,199
speak this one right one or two right
 

185
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,310
speak this one right one or two right
two is one one right okay then look

186
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:28,320
two is one one right okay then look
 

187
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,550
two is one one right okay then look
there's another special case equals two

188
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:30,560
there's another special case equals two
 

189
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,070
there's another special case equals two
what should we return

190
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,080

 

191
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,950

one three oh no no three three actually

192
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:36,960
one three oh no no three three actually
 

193

three
 

195
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,150
three
because two is here three three two

196
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,160
because two is here three three two
 

197
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:40,870

right one and one and one they give me
 

209
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,189
right one and one and one they give me
the product one

210
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:51,199
the product one
 

211
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,670
the product one
which is smaller than two right yeah

212
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:53,680
which is smaller than two right yeah
 

213
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,909
which is smaller than two right yeah
it's only ten two yeah the difference

214
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:55,919
it's only ten two yeah the difference
 

215
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,030
it's only ten two yeah the difference
okay so now let's

216
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:57,040
okay so now let's
 

217
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,990
okay so now let's
let's store this answer the maximum

218
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:00,000
let's store this answer the maximum
 

219
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,710
let's store this answer the maximum
product

220
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:00,720

beginning one why why
n is bigger than four okay then

224
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:07,280
n is bigger than four okay then
 

225
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,390
n is bigger than four okay then
we times look

226
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:10,400
we times look
 

227
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,510
we times look
if n is bigger what is it is four

228
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:13,520
if n is bigger what is it is four
 

229
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,150
if n is bigger what is it is four
sorry what is it is four what is four

230
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:18,160
sorry what is it is four what is four
 

231
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,710
sorry what is it is four what is four
and e or is four okay that's good

232
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:20,720
and e or is four okay that's good
 

233
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,950
and e or is four okay that's good
question i need four then

234
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:22,960
question i need four then
 

235
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,390
question i need four then
look if n is four what can you expect

236
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:26,400
look if n is four what can you expect
 

237
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,870
look if n is four what can you expect
can we join two and two right will give

238
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:28,880
can we join two and two right will give
 

239
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,070
can we join two and two right will give
me the four right

240
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:30,080
me the four right
 

241
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,590
me the four right
give me a four yeah all right all right

242
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:33,600
give me a four yeah all right all right
 

243
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,670
give me a four yeah all right all right
of course because if you split into

244
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:35,680
of course because if you split into
 

245
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,590
of course because if you split into
three and one that's not

246
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:37,600
three and one that's not
 

247
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,790
three and one that's not
optimum right so four is about uh

248
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:40,800
optimum right so four is about uh
 

249
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,670
optimum right so four is about uh
separation

250
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:41,680
separation
 

251
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,310
separation
between because we got a separation if

252
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:44,320
between because we got a separation if
 

253
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:44,710
between because we got a separation if
we

254
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:44,720
we
 

255
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,070
we
put more than four we can times equals

256
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:48,080
put more than four we can times equals
 

257
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,909
put more than four we can times equals
three and then we we take one three out

258
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:51,919
three and then we we take one three out
 

259
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:52,950
three and then we we take one three out
right

260
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:52,960
right
 

261
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,230
right
right all right for example four four

262
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:56,240
right all right for example four four
 

263
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,830
right all right for example four four
look four and let's do look at the five

264
00:05:59,830 --> 00:05:59,840
look four and let's do look at the five
 

265
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,590
look four and let's do look at the five
five equals three and two right right

266
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:03,600
five equals three and two right right
 

267
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,790
five equals three and two right right
yes so i take the three now i take i

268
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:06,800
yes so i take the three now i take i
 

269
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,670
yes so i take the three now i take i
i have one three and then now n is two

270
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:09,680
i have one three and then now n is two
 

271
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,430
i have one three and then now n is two
so what should we do

272
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:11,440
so what should we do
 

273
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,909
so what should we do
return what answer answer is three times

274
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:15,919
return what answer answer is three times
 

275
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,469
return what answer answer is three times
remains times n right doesn't make sense

276
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:20,479
remains times n right doesn't make sense
 

277
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,629
remains times n right doesn't make sense
all right does that make sense we take

278
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:22,639
all right does that make sense we take
 

279
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,710
all right does that make sense we take
we can take three uh

280
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:24,720
we can take three uh
 

281
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,430
we can take three uh
if if we can't if it's more than more

282
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:27,440
if if we can't if it's more than more
 

283
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:27,990
if if we can't if it's more than more
than four

284
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:28,000
than four
 

285
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,029
than four
we take three right and

286
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:31,039
we take three right and
 

287
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,870
we take three right and
when when is y loop x6

288
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:34,880
when when is y loop x6
 

289
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,990
when when is y loop x6
the n is smaller or equal to 4 right now

290
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:38,000
the n is smaller or equal to 4 right now
 

291
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,590
the n is smaller or equal to 4 right now
we just multiply what we meant

292
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:39,600
we just multiply what we meant
 

293
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:45,480
we just multiply what we meant
right what's the time complexity

294
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:45,490

 

295

look what's this how many iterations

298
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:49,039
look what's this how many iterations
 

299
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,469
look what's this how many iterations
maximum

300
00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:50,479
maximum
 

301
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,629
maximum
n oh and yeah because look every time

302
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:52,639
n oh and yeah because look every time
 

303
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,710
n oh and yeah because look every time
we're taking three three three so the

304
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:54,720
we're taking three three three so the
 

305
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,830
we're taking three three three so the
loop will be n divided by three but

306
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:57,840
loop will be n divided by three but
 

307
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,029
loop will be n divided by three but
look at our m divided by three but we

308
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:01,039
look at our m divided by three but we
 

309
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,629
look at our m divided by three but we
drop the constant right we drop the

310
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:02,639
drop the constant right we drop the
 

311
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,309
drop the constant right we drop the
constant so it's all n right does it

312
00:07:04,309 --> 00:07:04,319
constant so it's all n right does it
 

313
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,589
constant so it's all n right does it
make sense

314
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:05,599
make sense
 

315
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,830
make sense
okay okay okay that's it that's it

316
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:09,840
okay okay okay that's it that's it
 

317
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,950
okay okay okay that's it that's it
so listen listen up so

318
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:12,960
so listen listen up so

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,309
right
yes okay no here not yet this is one

334
00:07:42,309 --> 00:07:42,319
yes okay no here not yet this is one
 

335
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,150
yes okay no here not yet this is one
part of it we can also solve this

336
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:44,160
part of it we can also solve this
 

337
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,029
part of it we can also solve this
problem by

338
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:45,039
problem by
 

339
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,309
problem by
oh by the way

340
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:48,319

 

341
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,150

oh yeah it's something to do yeah

342
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:50,160
oh yeah it's something to do yeah
 

343
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,469
oh yeah it's something to do yeah
remember

344
00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:52,479
remember
 

345
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,510
remember
me mobilization dynamic programming yeah

346
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:55,520
me mobilization dynamic programming yeah
 

347
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,270
me mobilization dynamic programming yeah
yeah yeah yeah all right eric look

348
00:07:59,270 --> 00:07:59,280
yeah yeah yeah all right eric look
 

349
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,830
yeah yeah yeah all right eric look
so let's say fn is the maximum product

350
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:03,840
so let's say fn is the maximum product
 

351
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,710
so let's say fn is the maximum product
that we can get by splitting the integer

352
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:06,720
that we can get by splitting the integer
 

353
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,350
that we can get by splitting the integer
and right

354
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:07,360
and right
 

355
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,749
and right
don't don't come along you're making

356
00:08:09,749 --> 00:08:09,759
don't don't come along you're making
 

357
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,990
don't don't come along you're making
people dizzy okay

358
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:12,000
people dizzy okay
 

359
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,869
people dizzy okay
yeah okay doesn't make sense yeah yeah

360
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:14,879
yeah okay doesn't make sense yeah yeah
 

361
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:15,430
yeah okay doesn't make sense yeah yeah
okay so

362
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:15,440
okay so
 

363
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,029
okay so
if if n is one or

364
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:19,039
if if n is one or
 

365
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,589
if if n is one or
n equals two then we return we know

366
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:21,599
n equals two then we return we know
 

367
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:22,790
n equals two then we return we know
return one right

368
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:22,800
return one right
 

369
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,990
return one right
right yeah okay so now the the

370
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:26,000
right yeah okay so now the the
 

371
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,589
right yeah okay so now the the
thing is how can we split this okay so

372
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:29,599
thing is how can we split this okay so
 

373
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:34,310
thing is how can we split this okay so
is it equals to is it equals to

374
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:34,320
is it equals to is it equals to
 

375
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,149
is it equals to is it equals to
i'm i don't know because how many ways i

376
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:36,159
i'm i don't know because how many ways i
 

377
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,829
i'm i don't know because how many ways i
can split into this

378
00:08:38,829 --> 00:08:38,839
can split into this
 

379
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,149
can split into this
uh for example i can

380
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:42,159
uh for example i can
 

381
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,910
uh for example i can
try with one and then f and minus one

382
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:45,920
try with one and then f and minus one
 

383
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,550
try with one and then f and minus one
right

384
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:46,560
right
 

385
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,550
right
yeah all right yeah look if i split

386
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:50,560
yeah all right yeah look if i split
 

387
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,150
yeah all right yeah look if i split
one and then i i can do another f and

388
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:54,160
one and then i i can do another f and
 

389
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,070
one and then i i can do another f and
minus one

390
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:56,080
minus one
 

391
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,430
minus one
or i can oh it could be if i don't speak

392
00:08:59,430 --> 00:08:59,440
or i can oh it could be if i don't speak
 

393
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,590
or i can oh it could be if i don't speak
don't want to split these i can do this

394
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:01,600
don't want to split these i can do this
 

395
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,910
don't want to split these i can do this
one and and minus one right

396
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:03,920
one and and minus one right
 

397
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,550
one and and minus one right
why does it make sense but this one can

398
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:06,560
why does it make sense but this one can
 

399
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,550
why does it make sense but this one can
be between one

400
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:08,560
be between one
 

401
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,070
be between one
and one to n and minus one right

402
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:12,080
and one to n and minus one right
 

403
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,829
and one to n and minus one right
doesn't make sense because look f5

404
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:15,839
doesn't make sense because look f5
 

405
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,630
doesn't make sense because look f5
i want to split this integer five right

406
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:18,640
i want to split this integer five right
 

407
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,269
i want to split this integer five right
so i can

408
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:19,279
so i can
 

409
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,310
so i can
i can make it as one and four right

410
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:22,320
i can make it as one and four right
 

411
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,509
i can make it as one and four right
and two and three right yeah

412
00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:25,519
and two and three right yeah
 

413
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,550
and two and three right yeah
and three and two four and one right so

414
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:28,560
and three and two four and one right so
 

415
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,110
and three and two four and one right so
this

416
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:29,120
this
 

417
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,389
this
i can go from one to four and this is

418
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:32,399
i can go from one to four and this is
 

419
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,710
i can go from one to four and this is
this is n minus i right right

420
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:36,720
this is n minus i right right
 

421
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,230
this is n minus i right right
for each one look for each one

422
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:40,240
for each one look for each one
 

423
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,509
for each one look for each one
i can choose to split it which is f

424
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:43,519
i can choose to split it which is f
 

425
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,710
i can choose to split it which is f
and minus i right or i decide

426
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:46,720
and minus i right or i decide
 

427
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,710
and minus i right or i decide
not to split it i just use the integer

428
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:48,720
not to split it i just use the integer
 

429
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,550
not to split it i just use the integer
right does it make sense

430
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:50,560
right does it make sense
 

431
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,870
right does it make sense
so look so f n is the maximum

432
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:54,880
so look so f n is the maximum
 

433
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,470
so look so f n is the maximum
of y oh let's do this i okay

434
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:58,480
of y oh let's do this i okay
 

435
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,470
of y oh let's do this i okay
for i times n minus i yeah

436
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:02,480
for i times n minus i yeah
 

437
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,590
for i times n minus i yeah
i just say if i have eric if i just

438
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:05,600
i just say if i have eric if i just
 

439
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,430
i just say if i have eric if i just
split this integer between

440
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:07,440
split this integer between
 

441
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,509
split this integer between
i and minus i right yeah or

442
00:10:11,509 --> 00:10:11,519
i and minus i right yeah or
 

443
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,949
i and minus i right yeah or
i what something

444
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:14,959
i what something
 

445
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,150
i what something
f n minus i yeah if i spread the integer

446
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:18,160
f n minus i yeah if i spread the integer
 

447
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,150
f n minus i yeah if i spread the integer
i but i don't want to split it

448
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,160
i but i don't want to split it
 

449
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,190
i but i don't want to split it
i i will keep splitting it right

450
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:23,200
i i will keep splitting it right
 

451
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,710
i i will keep splitting it right
and where i is between 1

452
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:26,720
and where i is between 1
 

453
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,829
and where i is between 1
to n minus 1 right does make sense

454
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:29,839
to n minus 1 right does make sense
 

455
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,910
to n minus 1 right does make sense
this is called dynamic transition

456
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:31,920
this is called dynamic transition
 

457
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,949
this is called dynamic transition
function doesn't mean

458
00:10:32,949 --> 00:10:32,959
function doesn't mean
 

459
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,750
function doesn't mean
yeah do you still remember transaction

460
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:35,760
yeah do you still remember transaction
 

461
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,470
yeah do you still remember transaction
function

462
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:36,480
function
 

463
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,470
function
does it make sense so can you explain to

464
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:38,480
does it make sense so can you explain to
 

465
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:44,829
does it make sense so can you explain to
me come on

483
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,509

can be the maximum

484
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:07,519
can be the maximum
 

485
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,710
can be the maximum
of the i and

486
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:10,720
of the i and
 

487
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,910
of the i and
times the yeah yeah i know so what's

488
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:13,920
times the yeah yeah i know so what's
 

489
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,870
times the yeah yeah i know so what's
this bit

490
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:14,880
this bit
 

491
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,190
this bit
and what's this bit so look f5

492

and what's this bit so look f5
 

493
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,750
and what's this bit so look f5
so i want to split integer five right

494
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:21,760
so i want to split integer five right
 

495
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,310
so i want to split integer five right
yeah

496
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:22,320
yeah
 

497
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,430
yeah
so let's say i will be i will be between

498
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:25,440
so let's say i will be i will be between
 

499
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,470
so let's say i will be i will be between
one one two three four right

500
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:28,480
one one two three four right
 

501
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,670
one one two three four right
all right slowly it will be two choice

502
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:31,680
all right slowly it will be two choice
 

503
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,790
all right slowly it will be two choice
i can split one and then four

504
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:34,800
i can split one and then four
 

505
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,829
i can split one and then four
right two and three three and

506
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:37,839
right two and three three and
 

507
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,430
right two and three three and
two four and one right this is this bit

508
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:41,440
two four and one right this is this bit
 

509
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,110
two four and one right this is this bit
i times it together

510
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:43,120
i times it together
 

511
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,949
i times it together
or i keep splitting these

512
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:46,959
or i keep splitting these
 

513
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,829
or i keep splitting these
this will become f4 that will be two and

514
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:49,839
this will become f4 that will be two and
 

515
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:50,470
this will become f4 that will be two and
two or

516
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:50,480
two or
 

517
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,069
two or
does it make sense yeah yeah yeah

518
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:54,079
does it make sense yeah yeah yeah
 

519
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,750
does it make sense yeah yeah yeah
which one you tell me which one is

520
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:55,760
which one you tell me which one is
 

521
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,829
which one you tell me which one is
complete uh continuing splitting this

522
00:11:57,829 --> 00:11:57,839
complete uh continuing splitting this
 

523
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:58,949
complete uh continuing splitting this
function

524
00:11:58,949 --> 00:11:58,959
function
 

525
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,550
function
the sub problem because dynamic

526
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:00,560
the sub problem because dynamic
 

527
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,470
the sub problem because dynamic
performance yeah because look we have

528
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:02,480
performance yeah because look we have
 

529
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,310
performance yeah because look we have
f okay okay why maybe it's a bit too

530
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:06,320
f okay okay why maybe it's a bit too
 

531
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,990
f okay okay why maybe it's a bit too
late

532

late
 

533
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,350
late
okay all right okay so look we are given

534
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:11,360
okay all right okay so look we are given
 

535
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,190
okay all right okay so look we are given
this function and we determine the

536
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:13,200
this function and we determine the
 

537
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,870
this function and we determine the
condition and we can implement it

538
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:14,880
condition and we can implement it
 

539
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,949
condition and we can implement it
using how many approaches and

540
00:12:18,949 --> 00:12:18,959
using how many approaches and
 

541
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,190
using how many approaches and
how which how many dynamic programmings

542
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:21,200
how which how many dynamic programmings
 

543
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:21,990
how which how many dynamic programmings
are we

544
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:22,000
are we
 

545
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,430
are we
talking about remembering uh

546
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:25,440
talking about remembering uh
 

547
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,550
talking about remembering uh
two okay what are those top

548
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:28,560
two okay what are those top
 

549
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,310
two okay what are those top
top down and the other one

550
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:32,320

 

551
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,350

okay top down top down and bottom up

552
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:35,360
okay top down top down and bottom up
 

553
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:35,829
okay top down top down and bottom up
okay

554
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:35,839
okay
 

555
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,829
okay
so which one is the recursion with me

556
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:39,839
so which one is the recursion with me
 

557
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,990
so which one is the recursion with me
momentation

558
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:44,000

 

559
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,069

yeah top down okay so look let's let's

560
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:46,079
yeah top down okay so look let's let's
 

561
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,269
yeah top down okay so look let's let's
do it define

562
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:47,279
do it define
 

563
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,870
do it define
okay fm column yeah and then we're going

564
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:50,880
okay fm column yeah and then we're going
 

565
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,509
okay fm column yeah and then we're going
to we

566
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:51,519
to we
 

567
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,269
to we
look if n is one or

568
00:12:55,269 --> 00:12:55,279
look if n is one or
 

569
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:59,110
look if n is one or
n equals to return one

570
00:12:59,110 --> 00:12:59,120
n equals to return one
 

571
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,389
n equals to return one
return one we're done okay and now

572
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:02,399
return one we're done okay and now
 

573
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,310
return one we're done okay and now
look at let's let's say this answer

574
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:04,320
look at let's let's say this answer
 

575
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,310
look at let's let's say this answer
let's a answer equals one okay

576
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:06,320
let's a answer equals one okay
 

577
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,150
let's a answer equals one okay
look for i in

578
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:10,160
look for i in
 

579
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,509
look for i in
range range one can you tell me what you

580
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:13,519
range range one can you tell me what you
 

581
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:14,870
range range one can you tell me what you
are

582
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:14,880
are
 

583
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,590
are
when you are the i remember the i how

584
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:17,600
when you are the i remember the i how
 

585
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,350
when you are the i remember the i how
many ways we can split it

586
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:19,360
many ways we can split it
 

587
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,949
many ways we can split it
between array i

588
00:13:22,949 --> 00:13:22,959
between array i
 

589
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,310
between array i
i will be from what one

590
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:26,320
i will be from what one
 

591
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,509
i will be from what one
one to one uh n

592
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:29,519
one to one uh n
 

593
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,590
one to one uh n
and yeah so actually it's one to n minus

594
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:31,600
and yeah so actually it's one to n minus
 

595
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,350
and yeah so actually it's one to n minus
one but you're given the one plus one

596
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:33,360
one but you're given the one plus one
 

597
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,949
one but you're given the one plus one
yeah the second finger

598
00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:34,959
yeah the second finger
 

599
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,150
yeah the second finger
and then look answer will be equal the

600
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,160
and then look answer will be equal the
 

601
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:38,870
and then look answer will be equal the
maximum

602
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:38,880
maximum
 

603
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,230
maximum
of of what i

604
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:42,240
of of what i
 

605
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,670
of of what i
i times n minus i right

606
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:45,680
i times n minus i right
 

607
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,710
i times n minus i right
or i times f n

608
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:48,720
or i times f n
 

609
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,110
or i times f n
minus i right this means we keep

610
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:51,120
minus i right this means we keep
 

611
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,790
minus i right this means we keep
splitting it right

612
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:52,800
splitting it right
 

613
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:58,389
splitting it right
and then yeah yeah yeah

614
00:13:58,389 --> 00:13:58,399

 

615
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,230

of course what's missing here cash

616
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:02,240
of course what's missing here cash
 

617
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,430
of course what's missing here cash
cash yeah we are down cash cash yeah

618
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:05,440
cash yeah we are down cash cash yeah
 

619
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,110
cash yeah we are down cash cash yeah
because if you're not using the cash

620
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:07,120
because if you're not using the cash
 

621
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,389
because if you're not using the cash
what happened you'll be

622
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:08,399
what happened you'll be
 

623
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,189
what happened you'll be
exponential yeah we're calculating over

624
00:14:11,189 --> 00:14:11,199
exponential yeah we're calculating over
 

625
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,990
exponential yeah we're calculating over
and over again

626
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:12,000
and over again
 

627
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,910
and over again
we want to take it we want to avoid

628
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:13,920
we want to take it we want to avoid
 

629
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,750
we want to take it we want to avoid
computing the same thing over and over

630
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:15,760
computing the same thing over and over
 

631
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,150
computing the same thing over and over
again

632
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:16,160
again
 

633
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,750
again
what's the time complexity

634
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:19,760

 

635
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,870

think about it with cash no cash what's

636
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:22,880
think about it with cash no cash what's
 

637
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,310
think about it with cash no cash what's
the time connection right

638
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:26,320
the time connection right
 

639
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,110
the time connection right
what you doing nothing what are you

640
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:29,120
what you doing nothing what are you
 

641
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,189
what you doing nothing what are you
doing nothing

642
00:14:31,189 --> 00:14:31,199
doing nothing
 

643
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,150
doing nothing
come on what's the time domestic what's

644
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:34,160
come on what's the time domestic what's
 

645
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,269
come on what's the time domestic what's
the tango recipe

646
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:35,279
the tango recipe
 

647
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:46,629
the tango recipe
the time complexity is

648
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:46,639

 

649
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,350

it's actually o and square because look

650
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:49,360
it's actually o and square because look
 

651
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,389
it's actually o and square because look
it's it's

652
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:50,399
it's it's
 

653
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,110
it's it's
really all right look because we are

654
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:53,120
really all right look because we are
 

655
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,509
really all right look because we are
having a four and then here

656
00:14:55,509 --> 00:14:55,519
having a four and then here
 

657
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,509
having a four and then here
this is because we're calling that right

658
00:14:57,509 --> 00:14:57,519
this is because we're calling that right
 

659
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:03,509
this is because we're calling that right
what's the space complexity

660
00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:03,519

 

661
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,150

what how many values of n f n we are

662
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:06,160
what how many values of n f n we are
 

663
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,509
what how many values of n f n we are
calculating

664
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:07,519
calculating
 

665
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,710
calculating
how many how many maximum items can be

666
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:10,720
how many how many maximum items can be
 

667
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:18,069
how many how many maximum items can be
stored in the cache

668
00:15:18,069 --> 00:15:18,079

 

669
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,550

one why so why are we using the cache

670
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:20,560
one why so why are we using the cache
 

671
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,030
one why so why are we using the cache
come on how is that aware

672
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:23,040
come on how is that aware
 

673
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,310
come on how is that aware
all right come on because we are

674
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:24,320
all right come on because we are
 

675
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,629
all right come on because we are
calculating we need to store the numbers

676
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:26,639
calculating we need to store the numbers
 

677
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,670
calculating we need to store the numbers
in the result of f

678
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:29,680
in the result of f
 

679
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,389
in the result of f
and values in the cache right yeah and i

680
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:32,399
and values in the cache right yeah and i
 

681
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:32,870
and values in the cache right yeah and i
know

682
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:32,880
know
 

683
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,590
know
f1 f2 f3 and therefore so let's the

684
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:35,600
f1 f2 f3 and therefore so let's the
 

685
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,310
f1 f2 f3 and therefore so let's the
complexity

686
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:36,320
complexity
 

687
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,470
complexity
the space complexity is always right

688
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:38,480
the space complexity is always right
 

689
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,629
the space complexity is always right
come on come on eric ryan

690
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:40,639
come on come on eric ryan
 

691
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,829
come on come on eric ryan
uh why this is this this is o

692
00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:43,839
uh why this is this this is o
 

693
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,030
uh why this is this this is o
n but here

694
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:47,040
n but here
 

695
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,069
n but here
we are calculating another right so that

696
00:15:50,069 --> 00:15:50,079
we are calculating another right so that
 

697
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,350
we are calculating another right so that
will be o n square right

698
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:51,360
will be o n square right
 

699
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:58,550
will be o n square right
yeah okay okay come on

700
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:58,560

 

701
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,949

dynamic programming which is not usually

702
00:16:00,949 --> 00:16:00,959
dynamic programming which is not usually
 

703
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,310
dynamic programming which is not usually
implemented using the question of

704
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:02,320
implemented using the question of
 

705
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,590
implemented using the question of
improvisation okay let's

706
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:03,600
improvisation okay let's
 

707
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,829
improvisation okay let's
write this down with the another

708
00:16:06,829 --> 00:16:06,839
write this down with the another
 

709
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:12,450
write this down with the another
approach

710
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:12,460

 

711
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:15,749

[Music]

712
00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:15,759

 

713
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,470

approach how what kind what's the first

714
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:18,480
approach how what kind what's the first
 

715
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,829
approach how what kind what's the first
value we need to calculating

716
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:19,839
value we need to calculating
 

717
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,269
value we need to calculating
what's the difference between top down

718
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:21,279
what's the difference between top down
 

719
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,189
what's the difference between top down
and bottom up

720
00:16:23,189 --> 00:16:23,199
and bottom up
 

721
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,870
and bottom up
down is we remember

722
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:26,880
down is we remember
 

723
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,069
down is we remember
meanwhile yeah so i'm saying this top

724
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:30,079
meanwhile yeah so i'm saying this top
 

725
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,269
meanwhile yeah so i'm saying this top
down because

726
00:16:31,269 --> 00:16:31,279
down because
 

727
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,670
down because
because we are we want to know the f1

728
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:33,680
because we are we want to know the f1
 

729
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,710
because we are we want to know the f1
value right

730
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:34,720
value right
 

731
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,949
value right
in order to calculate fn value we we

732
00:16:36,949 --> 00:16:36,959
in order to calculate fn value we we
 

733
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,230
in order to calculate fn value we we
need to explain it f

734
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:38,240
need to explain it f
 

735
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,350
need to explain it f
f n minus one f n minus two right

736
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:41,360
f n minus one f n minus two right
 

737
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,710
f n minus one f n minus two right
side etc using this

738
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:44,720
side etc using this
 

739
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,150
side etc using this
uh direction into o

740
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:48,160
uh direction into o
 

741
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,629
uh direction into o
f one right this is called top down but

742
00:16:50,629 --> 00:16:50,639
f one right this is called top down but
 

743
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,310
f one right this is called top down but
in the bottom up

744
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:52,320
in the bottom up
 

745
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,470
in the bottom up
from the bottom so which is you are

746
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:54,480
from the bottom so which is you are
 

747
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,949
from the bottom so which is you are
constructing the values from f1 f2 and

748
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:56,959
constructing the values from f1 f2 and
 

749
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,310
constructing the values from f1 f2 and
then you're going this way this is

750
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:58,320
then you're going this way this is
 

751
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,749
then you're going this way this is
called butter up right

752
00:16:59,749 --> 00:16:59,759
called butter up right
 

753
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,189
called butter up right
yes this makes sense okay so now we step

754
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:03,199
yes this makes sense okay so now we step
 

755
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:04,870
yes this makes sense okay so now we step
with the bottle out we usually don't

756
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:04,880
with the bottle out we usually don't
 

757
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,750
with the bottle out we usually don't
need to use the recursion we use the

758
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:07,760
need to use the recursion we use the
 

759
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,230
need to use the recursion we use the
array right to store the values right

760
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:10,240
array right to store the values right
 

761
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,110
array right to store the values right
yeah yeah

762
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:11,120
yeah yeah
 

763
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,350
yeah yeah
so let's do it define f and

764
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:15,360
so let's do it define f and
 

765
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,909
so let's do it define f and
and then look let's have a dp array

766
00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:17,919
and then look let's have a dp array
 

767
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:20,069
and then look let's have a dp array
right dbra equals at the beginning will

768
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:20,079
right dbra equals at the beginning will
 

769
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:20,710
right dbra equals at the beginning will
be 1

770
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:20,720
be 1
 

771
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,870
be 1
times m m minus 1 right and pi

772
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:24,880
times m m minus 1 right and pi
 

773
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,909
times m m minus 1 right and pi
okay now look we want to stop we

774
00:17:27,909 --> 00:17:27,919
okay now look we want to stop we
 

775
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,430
okay now look we want to stop we
we want to start from i in

776
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:31,440
we want to start from i in
 

777
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,110
we want to start from i in
branch let's let's do this one to m plus

778
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:35,120
branch let's let's do this one to m plus
 

779
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,470
branch let's let's do this one to m plus
one right this is the

780
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:36,480
one right this is the
 

781
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,110
one right this is the
first iteration is the fl we are now

782
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:39,120
first iteration is the fl we are now
 

783
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,470
first iteration is the fl we are now
calculating

784
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:40,480
calculating
 

785
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,150
calculating
and second second loop

786
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:44,160
and second second loop
 

787
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,510
and second second loop
second iteration is to to

788
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:47,520
second iteration is to to
 

789
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,510
second iteration is to to
to to list the number of different

790
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:51,520
to to list the number of different
 

791
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,830
to to list the number of different
different ways to split the integer

792
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:53,840
different ways to split the integer
 

793
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,110
different ways to split the integer
right all right

794
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:55,120
right all right
 

795
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,270
right all right
so for j in range

796
00:17:59,270 --> 00:17:59,280
so for j in range
 

797
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,549
so for j in range
okay what's the two values here

798
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:02,559
okay what's the two values here
 

799
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,669
okay what's the two values here
how many ways we store uh splitting the

800
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:05,679
how many ways we store uh splitting the
 

801
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,870
how many ways we store uh splitting the
integer

802
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:08,880

 

803
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,549

j for j in ranger

804
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:12,559
j for j in ranger
 

805
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,070
j for j in ranger
you just give me the answer it's the

806
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:14,080
you just give me the answer it's the
 

807
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,830
you just give me the answer it's the
same what's the answer

808
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:15,840
same what's the answer
 

809
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,230
same what's the answer
one and one what's the second there's no

810
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:18,240
one and one what's the second there's no
 

811
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,190
one and one what's the second there's no
end no

812
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:19,200
end no
 

813
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,430
end no
i'm just saying i i plus one

814
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:23,440
i'm just saying i i plus one
 

815
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,669
i'm just saying i i plus one
right now it's i yeah it's not true

816
00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:25,679
right now it's i yeah it's not true
 

817
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,669
right now it's i yeah it's not true
because we're splitting one

818
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:27,679
because we're splitting one
 

819
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,710
because we're splitting one
to i minus one right we are going to

820
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:30,720
to i minus one right we are going to
 

821
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,110
to i minus one right we are going to
with

822
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:31,120
with
 

823
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,190
with
i minus one okay so now dp

824
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:35,200
i minus one okay so now dp
 

825
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,029
i minus one okay so now dp
i right because i'm calculating this

826
00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:37,039
i right because i'm calculating this
 

827
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,510
i right because i'm calculating this
equals this is dpi we're calculating

828
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:39,520
equals this is dpi we're calculating
 

829
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,150
equals this is dpi we're calculating
equals

830
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:40,160

831
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,190
equals
max of dpi

832
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:43,200
max of dpi
 

833
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,549
max of dpi
yeah we are getting we're starting the

834
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:44,559
yeah we are getting we're starting the
 

835
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,710
yeah we are getting we're starting the
maximum and then look

836
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:46,720
maximum and then look
 

837
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,549
maximum and then look
j j times

838
00:18:50,549 --> 00:18:50,559
j j times
 

839
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:54,150
j j times
there's no n i i minus j right

840
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:54,160
there's no n i i minus j right
 

841
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,270
there's no n i i minus j right
or j times what

842
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:57,280
or j times what
 

843
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,190
or j times what
p p y i

844
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:01,200
p p y i
 

845
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,230
p p y i
minus y yeah you see this is quite

846
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:04,240
minus y yeah you see this is quite
 

847
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,669
minus y yeah you see this is quite
similar i'm putting this one right

848
00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:05,679
similar i'm putting this one right
 

849
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,950
similar i'm putting this one right
right yeah all right

850
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:08,960
right yeah all right
 

851
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,029
right yeah all right
does it make sense return which value dp

852
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:13,039
does it make sense return which value dp
 

853
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:16,150
does it make sense return which value dp
ppu is valuable minus one

854
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:16,160
ppu is valuable minus one
 

855
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,270
ppu is valuable minus one
minus one which minus one is which value

856
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:19,280
minus one which minus one is which value
 

857
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,710
minus one which minus one is which value
is one which value is plus minus one

858
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:22,720
is one which value is plus minus one
 

859
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,870
is one which value is plus minus one
last one last one and which which is the

860
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:24,880
last one last one and which which is the
 

861
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,310
last one last one and which which is the
last one

862
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:28,320

 

863
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,430

yeah yeah okay dpn yeah because this is

864
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:31,440
yeah yeah okay dpn yeah because this is
 

865
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,630
yeah yeah okay dpn yeah because this is
n plus n plus one is actually dp

866
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:34,640
n plus n plus one is actually dp
 

867
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,549
n plus n plus one is actually dp
0 to dpn right why does it make sense

868
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:38,559
0 to dpn right why does it make sense
 

869
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,029
0 to dpn right why does it make sense
so you your last one is ppn is the look

870
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:41,039
so you your last one is ppn is the look
 

871
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:41,590
so you your last one is ppn is the look
we are

872
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:41,600
we are
 

873
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,190
we are
it's the very one looking for the tail

874
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:45,200
it's the very one looking for the tail
 

875
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,950
it's the very one looking for the tail
look yeah the term convexity for this

876
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:46,960
look yeah the term convexity for this
 

877
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,510
look yeah the term convexity for this
one is quite easy

878
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:49,520
one is quite easy
 

879
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,270
one is quite easy
it's just quite easy to see yeah

880
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:51,280
it's just quite easy to see yeah
 

881
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,029
it's just quite easy to see yeah
stressful yeah what's the time

882
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:53,039
stressful yeah what's the time
 

883
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:57,990
stressful yeah what's the time
comparison

884
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:58,000

 

885
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,070

what this is and an iteration

886
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:02,080
what this is and an iteration
 

887
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,270
what this is and an iteration
and this one is from and squad yeah

888
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:05,280
and this one is from and squad yeah
 

889
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,170
and this one is from and squad yeah
what's your space complexity

890
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:08,180
what's your space complexity
 

891
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,590
what's your space complexity
[Music]

892
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:09,600
[Music]
 

893
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,789
[Music]
we are using a db array and because

894
00:20:12,789 --> 00:20:12,799
we are using a db array and because
 

895
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:16,230
we are using a db array and because
it is look and size yeah doesn't make

896
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:16,240
it is look and size yeah doesn't make
 

897
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:16,789
it is look and size yeah doesn't make
sense

898
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:16,799
sense
 

899
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,510
sense
look hey look this is quite similar to

900
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:19,520
look hey look this is quite similar to
 

901
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,590
look hey look this is quite similar to
the top-down dynamic programming yeah if

902
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:21,600
the top-down dynamic programming yeah if
 

903
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,789
the top-down dynamic programming yeah if
you remember eric

904
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:22,799
you remember eric
 

905
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,590
you remember eric
yeah yeah look at this one if you choose

906
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:25,600
yeah yeah look at this one if you choose
 

907
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,789
yeah yeah look at this one if you choose
to split with j

908
00:20:26,789 --> 00:20:26,799
to split with j
 

909
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,750
to split with j
and i minus three two numbers or if you

910
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:29,760
and i minus three two numbers or if you
 

911
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,350
and i minus three two numbers or if you
choose to split it with j

912
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:31,360
choose to split it with j
 

913
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,230
choose to split it with j
and continue splitting with i minus j

914
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:34,240
and continue splitting with i minus j
 

915
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,750
and continue splitting with i minus j
this integer right

916
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:35,760
this integer right
 

917
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,990
this integer right
doesn't make sense yeah okay so i know

918
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:38,000
doesn't make sense yeah okay so i know
 

919
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,750
doesn't make sense yeah okay so i know
what last week we

920
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:39,760
what last week we
 

921
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,070
what last week we
we returned back uh last name look this

922
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:42,080
we returned back uh last name look this
 

923
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,430
we returned back uh last name look this
is more straightforward

924
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:43,440
is more straightforward
 

925
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,710
is more straightforward
and more simple to implement right yeah

926
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:46,720
and more simple to implement right yeah
 

927
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,590
and more simple to implement right yeah
and it does not have a location usually

928
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:49,600
and it does not have a location usually
 

929
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,510
and it does not have a location usually
it's faster because the recursion

930
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:51,520
it's faster because the recursion
 

931
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,630
it's faster because the recursion
is uh contains the functional cost yeah

932
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:54,640
is uh contains the functional cost yeah
 

933
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,070
is uh contains the functional cost yeah
because of the computer we call a

934
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:56,080
because of the computer we call a
 

935
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,390
because of the computer we call a
function and this there's an overhead

936
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:58,400
function and this there's an overhead
 

937
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,549
function and this there's an overhead
but this one is just the array and we're

938
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:00,559
but this one is just the array and we're
 

939
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,270
but this one is just the array and we're
just iteratingly array just to update

940
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:03,280
just iteratingly array just to update
 

941
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,149
just iteratingly array just to update
the values so

942
00:21:04,149 --> 00:21:04,159
the values so
 

943
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,110
the values so
it's usually faster does it make sense

944
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:07,120
it's usually faster does it make sense
 

945
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,350
it's usually faster does it make sense
yeah which one is the fastest

946
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:09,360
yeah which one is the fastest
 

947
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,830
yeah which one is the fastest
three ways greedy the first one

948
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:11,840
three ways greedy the first one
 

949
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,830
three ways greedy the first one
mathematic greedy split into three

950
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:13,840
mathematic greedy split into three
 

951
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,990
mathematic greedy split into three
do you still remember the second one top

952
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:16,000
do you still remember the second one top
 

953
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,590
do you still remember the second one top
down and the third one butter out which

954
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:17,600
down and the third one butter out which
 

955
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,870
down and the third one butter out which
ones

956
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:18,880
ones
 

957
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,590
ones
greedy yeah i just do still remember the

958
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:21,600
greedy yeah i just do still remember the
 

959
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,510
greedy yeah i just do still remember the
greedy the complete

960
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:23,520
greedy the complete
 

961
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,270
greedy the complete
the complexion

962
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:27,280

 

963
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,149

oh and yeah yeah so which one is faster

964
00:21:30,149 --> 00:21:30,159
oh and yeah yeah so which one is faster
 

965
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:31,190
oh and yeah yeah so which one is faster
oh and

966
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:31,200
oh and
 

967
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,870
oh and
square we're done that's what i want

968
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:34,880
square we're done that's what i want
 

969
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,350
square we're done that's what i want
yeah

970
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:35,360
yeah
 

971
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,110
yeah
i think it's slower than everything

972
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:39,120
i think it's slower than everything
 

973
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,630
i think it's slower than everything

okay that's it for today so you can say

976
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:44,480
okay that's it for today so you can say
 

977
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,830
okay that's it for today so you can say
bye bye see you tomorrow
