1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,640
hello hello mr mr ryan are you right so

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,839
what's this

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,560
no

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,800
no

5
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,760
what's this what kind of data structure

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,240
is this

7
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,160
graph graph yes g

8
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,040
okay is it a tree

9
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,680
no

10
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,600
why is that because it's not connected

11
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,680
where are the perfect okay so this is

12
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,359
the quad graph is actually a collection

13
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,560
of vertex and edges

14
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:30,000
so robotics yes when you check the graph

15
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:32,399
graph what exactly that is okay i'm

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,120
gonna put a zero here vertex zero one

17
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:38,480
two three therefore vertex the edges

18
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,879
one two two three okay so a graph can be

19
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,360
directly or undirected so at least a

20
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,640
directive graph or an directional

21
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,480
look at this

22
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,200
direct means with the edges has

23
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,280
direction it is a directive

24
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,039
on the next graph

25
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,160
yeah because we haven't got any

26
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,360
directions

27
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,840
the number of edges connected to a

28
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,000
vertex it's called degree right for a

29
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,239
directed graph it can be an incoming

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,760
degree or outgoing degree right but for

31
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:10,720
this indirect graph is just degree right

32
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,960
so look the degree of this one is one

33
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,360
degree of two is two there are two edges

34
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,080
degree of three is one degree of zero is

35
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,280
zero so the number of edges equals to

36
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,640
the sum of all the degrees of each

37
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,840
vertex

38
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:30,320
right divided by two for the direct

39
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:33,040
graph the degree is the sum of the both

40
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:36,000
incoming or outgoing degree right income

41
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:39,040
look for the directive graph yeah

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,520
one to two that's incoming degree

43
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,680
two to three that's outgoing right let's

44
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,159
look at this undirected graph let's look

45
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,880
at this okay zero one

46
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:51,360
two okay this is a simple graph with

47
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,240
three vertex three vertex and three

48
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,119
edges so the number of edges is three

49
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,200
okay the number of degrees for the zero

50
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,920
is two right

51
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,360
the number of degrees for the one is two

52
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,960
two edges

53
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,759
the number of

54
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,800
degree of vertex two is two so 2 plus 2

55
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,440
plus 2

56
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,200
divided by 2 right why we need to divide

57
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,319
by 2

58
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:19,280
look let's graph the number of edges

59
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,040
connected to the vertex 0 is 2

60
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,599
connected to 1 is 2

61
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,959
connecting to two is two so i can say

62
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,040
the number of edges there are three

63
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,200
edges equals two plus two plus two

64
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,440
divided by two why this is divided by

65
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,760
two why do we need to divide by two

66
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,800
is in between two

67
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,800
sorry because

68
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,640
between

69
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,400
these guys

70
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,280
look look this

71
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,280
is in between

72
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,720
is counting twice all right look at

73
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,519
edges says two end points

74
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,519
so

75
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,800
edge is at two point when i counted

76
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,959
these vertex

77
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,440
the degree it counted once when i

78
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,280
counted here it counted once all right

79
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,080
so if i add it together divided by two

80
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,080
that's the number total number of edges

81
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,239
okay so now coming back to today's

82
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,440
question okay we're given an undirected

83
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,840
graph

84
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,000
and we want to count the number of pairs

85
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,480
of vertex that are unreachable for each

86
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,440
other so for example like this simple

87
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:38,400
graph this graph the number of under

88
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,480
which the pairs so look zero can't go to

89
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,959
one right because it's not connected

90
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,200
zero comes to two zero can go to three

91
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,200
all right so the number of pairs is

92
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,760
three

93
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,000
zero one is the same as

94
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,799
one zero

95
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,360
the number of the pairs we are counting

96
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,680
only distinct number of pairs right okay

97
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,599
zero one is the same as one zero so

98
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,760
there are three pairs which are

99
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,360
three pairs of vertex there and which

100
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,280
were from each other

101
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,879
zero

102
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,400
one

103
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,080
two

104
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,599
how many unreachable

105
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:18,720
vertex from each other

106
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:21,519
why is that because it's

107
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,440
connected connected yes every every

108
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,759
vertex can go to everyone okay another

109
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,040
example zero one two

110
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,240
three four how many pair of vertex that

111
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,960
cannot

112
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,960
reach each other 33 and 2 to 4

113
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,919
okay wonderful

114
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,680
okay

115
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,280
0 2 3

116
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,800
0 2 4

117
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,960
one two three

118
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,400
two two three two two four so how many

119
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,000
points six

120
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,800
how tall do we get six

121
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,720
by counting dude but this is we just

122
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,280
haven't is there a better way to count

123
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,639
this there are three how many connected

124
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,479
components here

125
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,479
two okay two

126
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,000
how many vertex in in the first

127
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,080
component

128
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
how many nouns three

129
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,639
how many notes here two

130
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,360
how do you get six three times two okay

131
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,160
another question okay so three four five

132
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,560
here

133
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,840
so how many pairs

134
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,919
nine nine pairs okay and how about this

135
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,960
two one two three four five how many

136
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,400
pairs

137
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,199
it's hard right

138
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,800
right i can sort this problem

139
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,919
um

140
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,960
let's see

141
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:32,080
how do salvador

142
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,280
bingo

143
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,520
i just got you busted

144
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,199
oh okay come on you're on youtube but

145
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:43,039
don't say the swear word okay come on

146
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,039
nothing you swear okay

147
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,479
okay

148
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:51,759
30 how did you get 30. wait wait

149
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:53,600
eight eight yes that's now okay so we

150
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,039
got a six here all right yeah let's

151
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,560
steer close right

152
00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:00,880
yeah

153
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,960
and what else can we get five to nothing

154
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,759
and we can get three five

155
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,759
yeah

156
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,639
four five

157
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:11,280
and we get a still five we got one five

158
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,600
we can't get four five or three five

159
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,440
right they're not connected that's right

160
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,600
we're counting the the

161
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,800
the pairs that connect not connected so

162
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:23,280
how many of these six plus five eleven

163
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,440
well what was your answer again

164
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,400
uh eleven you never i'm going to check

165
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,400
the video okay

166
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,560
okay

167
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,960
okay

168
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,960
actually i

169
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,530
[Laughter]

170
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,160
what's your thoughts about that um

171
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,080
how do we conquer this is the last

172
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,000
question how do we calculate

173
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,880

174
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,319
so look

175
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,080
look we have a three notes here

176
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,160
dictionary

177
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,919
we have three notes two notes here and

178
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,560
one note there are three groups there

179
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:06,960
are three two one when we are looking at

180
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,599
these three notes in the first group how

181
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,840
many pairs can we form by

182
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,840
using the notes here

183
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,840
three how many notes together six no

184
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,400
right three notes here right how many

185
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,759
pairs of notes connecting to the note in

186
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,479
the first group

187
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:25,039
three times what how many notes together

188
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:28,000
six how many notes

189
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:30,560
are not in the first group

190
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,960
three six minus three there are total

191
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,160
six notes and the notes in the first

192
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,759
group are

193
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,039
the vertex in the first two by three

194
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,400
there are three

195
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,319
so six times

196
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,840
minus three is we know

197
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,639
times three

198
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,800
okay here

199
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,400
how many nodes are in the second group

200
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,240
there are two right

201
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,560
so how many nodes

202
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,120
are not in the second group six minus

203
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,120
two all right and times two okay how

204
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,360
many nodes are in the third group

205
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,639
one how many nodes are not in the same

206
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,919
the third group

207
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,919
six minus one times one right so if we

208
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,120
add it together we still need to do one

209
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,280
thing

210
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,599
three times three

211
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,840
three times with nine

212
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,199
four times two

213
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,879
eight

214
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,039
five times one

215
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,000
five five if you add it together how

216
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,919
many

217
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
22

218
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:28,720
are we calculated as 11 why is that

219
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,199
why should we divide it by two why do we

220
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:34,479
need to divide it by two come on because

221
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:38,479
what i said man no come on

222
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:42,800
22 we need to divide by two y uh because

223
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:45,120
because look when i say one two

224
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,040
is punch and then three is four how many

225
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,160
how many pairs

226
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,240
two

227
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,839
two pairs y is not four

228
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,880
when we count the vertex in the first

229
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,240
group

230
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:58,399
we multiply for the remaining the number

231
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,399
of the remaining vertex right but when

232
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,279
we count the remaining we're still

233
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,920
counting

234
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:07,440
extra so we need to divide by 2 right

235
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:09,680
look 1 to 2 that's a pair but 2 2 one is

236
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,920
the same so when we count one

237
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,160
when we are counting one

238
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,080
right so we we consider this two but

239
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,000
when we are counting two we consider

240
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,480
this one again so we need to divide by

241
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,240
two we can traverse on the graph what

242
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,399
kind of traversal accident can we use

243
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,399
dictionary what kind of treatment is

244
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,000
that definitely search breakfast yeah we

245
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,920
want to basically given the graph we

246
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,440
want to count how many groups

247
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,959
right

248
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,959
how many groups and also the number of

249
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,959
vertex in each group and then we can do

250
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,959
the math all right

251
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,839
i know we divided by two

252
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,600
yep

253
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,760
okay

254
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,120
do we understand this problem yep

255
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:49,519
we just need to

256
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,880
count the unusual pattern zero

257
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,399
one

258
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,440
two

259
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,200
three

260
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,839
four

261
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:01,680
five okay how many pairs

262
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:04,079
how many pairs one two three four four

263
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,160
do you even need to count there are

264
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,839
three notes in the first group there are

265
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,880
three notes in the second group so the

266
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,959
last one

267
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,720
is nine right it's fine

268
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,560
okay and then i add another one six

269
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,240
seven how many good it's harder it's

270
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,200
getting harder

271
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,600
there are two notes in the third group

272
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,399
three times three nine ten to eighteen

273
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,399
so

274
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,959
okay listen how many know how many total

275
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:30,160
number of notes three three plus three

276
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,519
plus two yeah in the graph layer eight t

277
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,600
equals eight

278
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:36,399
so i'm considering the first group now

279
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,920
so how many nodes how many pairs can we

280
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:41,839
form by connecting the nodes in uh by

281
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,880
using the nodes vertex in the first

282
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,399
group

283
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:48,640
so look 3

284
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,519
times t a minus three right look a minus

285
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,120
three

286
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,279
what does it mean a minus three means

287
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,160
there are five notes other than the

288
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,160
first group right

289
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,279
how many notes in the second group right

290
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:02,160
is the same three times a minus three

291
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,560
right

292
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,399
yeah we are considering the vertex in

293
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,560
the second group and how many notes

294
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,480
other than the second group

295
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,720
three plus two here

296
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:16,560
two here how many nodes are in the third

297
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,360
group two times a minus two right

298
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,560
look

299
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,160
so but you are adding these together

300
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,079
what's the answer

301
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,279
three times five

302
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:29,839
fifteen

303
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:31,360
fifteen plus fifteen plus 2 times 6 12

304
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,320
but we have to

305
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,000
divide by 2 right we talk about that why

306
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,000
we need to divide by 2.

307
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,760
what we talked about is the vertex in

308
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,680
the first group we connect it using uh

309
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,839
to the second group and group now when

310
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,839
we're calculating the second group we

311
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,600
connect it to the first good look

312
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,279
and that's we cut double counting we

313
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,200
count it twice so we need to divide by

314
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:55,680
twice so that's uh

315
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:57,519
42 divided by 2 is 21 now 21 pairs okay

316
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,279
so our our approach today will be

317
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,480
different search so we definitely search

318
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,160
the graph

319
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,920
then we count how many notes in each

320
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:07,200
group right

321
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:09,200
and then then we do this math

322
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,880
and we can also use the preference and

323
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,560
union yeah we're going to talk about you

324
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,519
know following filters this is very

325
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,760
important

326
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,519
define how

327
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,399
we are given

328
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,160
n n nodes from 0 to n minus 1 and we can

329
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,560
given the edges

330
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,480
we can convert these edges a to b if

331
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,600
this is undirected graph we can convert

332
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,360
it to a adjacent list okay g equals

333
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:35,279
before

334
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:38,720
dictionary and it's a list right

335
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,720
so for a

336
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:54,720
a okay there's a h coming from a to b

337
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,639
means the laser h from b to a right so

338
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,440
look zero

339
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,040
to

340
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:03,839
one two three right if we have this kind

341
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,440
of graph the g this is dictionary now g

342
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,720
will be a dictionary

343
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:12,720
of one zero would be two

344
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:16,079
one two three okay and then one would be

345
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:19,120
zero two will be zero

346
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:22,000
three will be zero so basically the keys

347
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,800
are the vertex and the values will be

348
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,120
the list of vertex it connects to it has

349
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,720
these edges so for for example 0 has the

350
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,639
edge to 1 2 3

351
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,120
2 has the edge to zero okay this is

352
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:35,680
called adjacent list okay this is a data

353
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,760
structure now we have this g

354
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,760
then okay obviously we have we want to

355
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,160
have this answer equals zero

356
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,000
and we we want to perform this step for

357
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,839
search and preference search in the

358
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,399
graph we need to use the hash set to

359
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,279
remember the notes we have seen okay so

360
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,800
sim

361
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,720
equals set

362
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,000
and now we're going to define a default

363
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,399
search

364
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,480
command now i if

365
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,720
if i in scene

366
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,880
so this device function will return the

367
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,360
number of nodes in the current group in

368
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,519
the calendar from the i so if i in sync

369
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,000
then we need to return zero

370
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,760
and the first thing is not visited we

371
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,560
need to add it to the

372
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:18,160
to the hash table to the notebook right

373
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:20,800
and then a equals zero a equals one

374
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,600
there's at least one node for

375
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,000
i

376
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,839
in gi

377
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,279
we're going to the

378
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:31,360
vertex it has added to language a plus

379
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,519
different search recursion i right and

380
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,480
then return a

381
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,839
okay

382
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,320
and then we can go

383
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,240
go through all the vertex and count how

384
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:44,800
many

385
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:45,680
how many notes right so for i in

386
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,079
in

387
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,440
range n

388
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:52,480
in range n

389
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:55,040
okay now we have this that if i not in

390
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,560
sin right if we haven't seen this before

391
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,600
you want to count how many nodes are is

392
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:01,680
it so c who has different search i so

393
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,800
c equals definition means that the

394
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:08,560
number of nodes the number of vertex in

395
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:11,040
the in connected connected to vertex i

396
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:15,360
and we can do this i'm writing here

397
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:16,320
answer plus equal c times total total n

398
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,160
notes

399
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,639
n minus c

400
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,399
right and then at the end we return

401
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,440
answer

402
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:28,160
divided by two okay our answer

403
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,199
answer shift shift one or divided by two

404
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,199
okay

405
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,320
can you describe to me what have you

406
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:35,040
learned today what's the problem what

407
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,040
have you learned today

408
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,839
there is a graph there's a graph yes

409
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,000
what kind of graph is it directed on

410
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:44,480
direct what's undirected it means it

411
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,880
doesn't have any direction direct it

412
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,959
doesn't have any direction

413
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,959
okay common sense okay so we are given a

414
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,079
directive graph and what are we doing

415
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,839
with it

416
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:56,480
we

417
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:59,680
are trying to figure out

418
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:03,199
count the unreachable

419
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:06,000
noise and reach the pair of vertex yeah

420
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:07,600
so how do we do it what's the mess

421
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,880
okay so look

422
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,079
is the no

423
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,160
zero one

424
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:14,560
two

425
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,959
three how many pairs of notes without

426
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,639
any items how many pairs of notes

427
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,000
that are unreachable

428
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:23,759
there are four notes

429
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,240
with no edges at all how many pesos

430
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,240
let's see

431
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,680
so what's how do we calculate wait i'm

432
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,440
just talking to that

433
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:37,360
[Music]

434
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:39,440
zero one zero two zero three one two one

435
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,240
three two three okay basically it's like

436
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,560
picking two out of four f

437
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:47,600
okay that's six yeah four times three

438
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:50,160
divided by two six six pairs

439
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,320
pressure the number of uh

440
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:55,040
unreachable pairs

441
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,759
i just told you six oh yeah the number

442
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:00,399
of unusual pairs in the same group is

443
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,920
the same right it's the same why is why

444
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,959
is that look

445
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:07,520
why is that zero and one connected zero

446
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:10,000
and one and then here is two and three

447
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,000
and four

448
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:16,079
so zero can form three pairs

449
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:18,400
one can also form three pairs right

450
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,720
okay so coming back to this question

451
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,400
what's the acronym we use today get the

452
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,400
search what are we doing with the

453
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,559
different search

454
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,880
we want to count how many notes and then

455
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:32,760
divided by two look

456
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,760
here two steps

457
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,080
that these that has two notes these has

458
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:40,080
three notes right so how do we get the

459
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,080
numbers two times how do you get the

460
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,080
numbers

461
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,520
we times them

462
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,120
yeah

463
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:50,720
that is 2

464
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:53,039
2 times 3 and and then here we will do

465
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:56,480
this that is 3 times 2 we add it

466
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:58,320
together and divide by 2 so that's 6.

467
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,120
but why can't you

468
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:03,600
just do two times three exactly that's a

469
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,600
good question why yes so in this

470
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,559
aggregate we are going through the nose

471
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,559
two two two yeah and then we count two

472
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,160
times but we need to go to these notes

473
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:15,160
again and three times two we add it

474
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,160
together

475
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,120
but the thing is that another group here

476
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,280
five six how do you do it

477
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,320
how do you do it using your brain how do

478
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,600
you do it

479
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,559
so you just say two times two times what

480
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,120
five

481
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,400
right now five notes here two times five

482
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,440
three times

483
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,760
four

484
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,559
two times five you add all these

485
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,600
together divided by two got it

486
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,559
yeah because

487
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:47,120
when i talk about this two times five

488
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:49,360
these has been calculated once yeah okay

489
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,240
when i call these three times

490
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,720
four

491
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,640
these has been calculated again so the

492
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,520
the connection between these has been

493
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:01,360
calculated twice what's about like this

494
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:03,200
two this five and this is this one

495
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,480
yeah so everything is counting twice

496
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,240
that's why we add it all together

497
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,720
divided by two

498
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,360
make sense

499
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,520
do you see my point that i i talk about

500
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,039
the the number of edges look

501
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,160
0

502
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,320
1

503
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,320
2

504
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,960
the edges have been counted twice right

505
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,360
look two edges here two edges here two

506
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:28,160
edges here two plus two plus two equals

507
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:30,240
six but how many edges here

508
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,960
how many edges there are three edges so

509
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:36,840
three six five divided by two okay

510
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,840
okay let's see for day bye

511
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,280
you
