1
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,000
no q-w-e-r-t

2
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,760
u-i-p okay and how about the second row

3
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,360
okay so let's yeah i have a few words

4
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,360
yeah

5
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:52,100
[Music]

6
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,320
um

7
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:07,439
[Music]

8
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,880
so we want to find out we're given a

9
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,280
list of words we want to find out which

10
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,439
words can be typed using only one rows

11
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,550
of keys right there so that's the

12
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,760
highlight

13
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:18,760
[Music]

14
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,880
a-a-i-a-s-k-a okay

15
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,439
so how many of these can be typed using

16
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,710
only one row of keys

17
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,520
ah

18
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:33,520
[Music]

19
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,799
alaska

20
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:41,520
yeah uh last case

21
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,479
dad okay okay yeah okay

22
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,840
okay

23
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,280
so yes so

24
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,280
how do we

25
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,560
how do we solve this problem i mean

26
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,280
that's code

27
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:55,640
yeah how do we solve this problem

28
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,640
okay how do we solve this oh

29
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,520
yeah yeah we check each actually

30
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,759
actually we go through each yeah each

31
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,000
one and we check the characters

32
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:14,160
in it we just go through each character

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,280
to see if it all belongs to the first

34
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:20,080
row second row of the row okay yeah

35
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,280
make sense yeah yeah yeah okay so

36
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,360
look there's a these words can become uh

37
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,400
can contain the uppercase letters so we

38
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,879
should be

39
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,680
uh carefully when checking if the

40
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,840
character is in first row second row

41
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,400
server okay so let's let's define this

42
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,400
first row

43
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,720
okay so uh so we can just do this yeah

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,640
so first of all first second the road

45
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,800
fall

46
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,440
hey what's the house where which one

47
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,440
asks

48
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,800
alaska so

49
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:11,200
uh

50
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,200
yeah let me just sounds more like a name

51
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,319
can you can you go sit down really

52
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,560
we are given a list of words

53
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:39,360
so first of all we have to define three

54
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:42,959
the keys in the first row which is e q w

55
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,560
e r p y ui

56
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,920
okay

57
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,159
the second row the second row is

58
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,319
a s t f g

59
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,239
h j k air

60
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,599
and the central

61
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,400
is

62
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,400
c

63
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,519
x c v b

64
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,360
and

65
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,720
m right okay

66
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,760
so we

67
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:08,319
these are the strings so we can

68
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,439
we can convert these strings into a set

69
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:13,599
hash set notebook why why can we do this

70
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,439
what's the advantage if we put a set

71
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:18,799
here anybody

72
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:21,280
what's the advantage if we convert this

73
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:23,360
is a 0-1

74
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:28,680
where the lookup term yes which is super

75
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,680
fast look if i string we can say okay

76
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,080
yeah first right if this first is a

77
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,919
string then the local term is linear

78
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,479
right so you have to go through

79
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:41,120
each character to see if it matches the

80
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:43,280
scene but if the first is a hash table a

81
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,800
headset then the lookup term is constant

82
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,360
yeah we talk about

83
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,840
hashtag hashtable right hash table so

84
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,800
basically we have that we won't convert

85
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,960
anything

86
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,880
you know so what's hashtable what's

87
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,840
hashtable

88
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,919
is so so we have something here and it

89
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,240
goes through a hash function

90
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:05,120
hashtag function and then it tells us

91
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,680
the partition where to store

92
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,360
where to store the items right so that's

93
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,039
one constant term right yeah okay

94
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,560
so can you not sit there otherwise

95
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,960
people will not see

96
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,639
the whiteboard okay they will just see

97
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,720
you

98
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,759
you are working here and there

99
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,800
okay

100
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,039
okay

101
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,280
so now okay so the answers we have the

102
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:30,320
answers obviously so we want to go

103
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:34,240
through each one for w in

104
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,240
r in word you know what

105
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,280
and then okay we define the function

106
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:42,639
first if check if this part this is a

107
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:45,680
single row if you check w then we append

108
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:49,759
it to answer yeah okay

109
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:51,759
apparent w and we return w

110
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,000
okay so the key thing here is the check

111
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,479
we haven't defined this check function

112
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,400
so how do we check as we said we want to

113
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,280
go through the characters in

114
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,919
in

115
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,400
word okay in word okay

116
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:06,720
so w right

117
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,000
so what what do we what can we do we can

118
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,680
say if we

119
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,039
return

120
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,600
or

121
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,360
all function okay or

122
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,000
x in

123
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,000
first row

124
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,440
x in first row 4

125
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,479
x in

126
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,680
w

127
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:28,160
right

128
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:30,720
so let me o means that everything inside

129
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,120
everything in there in the all function

130
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,880
needs to satisfy that means all

131
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,400
and what's annie there's another key

132
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,720
word called any what's any what's the

133
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,919
difference between all and any

134
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,919
um

135
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,919
or is like

136
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,080
like if that

137
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:49,599
it could be any of them

138
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:52,560
and then any could be like anything

139
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:55,280
and all is like comparing two and it

140
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,960
could be like any of them

141
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,240
anything is any if one of them

142
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,400
matches

143
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,639
then you return true oh means that

144
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,680
everything everything in

145
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,479
in that

146
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:12,080
right so oh here what the what means is

147
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:13,599
all x in first for x in w right look x

148
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,599
in w

149
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:18,800
x and w look

150
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,639
w is a string it's a word x is the

151
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,120
characters all are characters so it

152
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:26,160
basically means all the characters in w

153
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:29,199
needs to be in first row right

154
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,039
so needs to be first one so return all

155
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,759
and then all

156
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,720
of

157
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,120
all

158
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,599
same thing in second row yeah

159
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,319
or insert the row right

160
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:42,639
this is a three conditions even

161
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,720
either the characters from one first in

162
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,840
either the character from the

163
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,599
front w needs to be from first row or

164
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,800
needs to be running on secondary order

165
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:55,039
needs to be like on the server okay

166
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,599
so that's all so but before that we need

167
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,759
to convert this to lowercase to lower

168
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,440
total will be lower w

169
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,840
lower means to convert it to all

170
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,639
lowercase okay

171
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,720
the other way is we we can compare we

172
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,400
can convert it into set look

173
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,440
remember we already have the set of

174
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:16,400
first serve yeah if we convert it if we

175
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,910
convert it here if we converted w let's

176
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,120
say

177
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:21,680
[Music]

178
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,840
a equals set w

179
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,400
now we just have to check if at least a

180
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,879
if it's a subset of first

181
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,840
or if it's a subset of second or it's if

182
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,599
it's a subset of sir so we can use this

183
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:37,440
return

184
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:40,719
a dot is subset

185
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,000
e subset of first right

186
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,279
or

187
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,240
a dot is subset

188
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,200
of second yeah

189
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,640
or

190
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,640
a dot is subset

191
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,440
third okay

192
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:00,000
anybody can you tell me

193
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,080
do you understand this one a is a set of

194
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,959
the characters in the world and i want

195
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,120
to just

196
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,279
want to compare that if it's a subset of

197
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,320
the all the characters in the first row

198
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:13,040
or the second row also right

199
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,560
okay look what's up look

200
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,760
this is a subset this is a set a

201
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,399
subject

202
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,200
subset is the smaller one

203
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,519
yeah

204
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,920
this is a subset okay so what does it

205
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,279
mean s is a subset of a

206
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,320
everything

207
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:32,399
everything in s is contained by

208
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:36,880
a bigger set a right

209
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:38,800
so can you tell me okay s dot e subset

210
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,839
subset a

211
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:44,000
does it between two of us

212
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,240
x dot is subset of a does it return two

213
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,600
of us

214
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,360
huh

215
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,120
what do you mean first

216
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,279
come on just give me

217
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,279
why

218
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,440
okay yeah but why you say it's false at

219
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:04,399
the beginning because i don't know

220
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:06,160
okay okay how about a subset b subset is

221
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,399
subset of s

222
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,320
is it two of us

223
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,880
yeah because a is correct

224
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,880
how about this

225
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:21,360
the left is a the right is s

226
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:24,399
s is a subset of a

227
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:28,160
false okay how about s if it's this this

228
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:30,480
one yeah is this s is a subset of a

229
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,480
true

230
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,600
is a subset of a

231
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,600
okay right yeah okay

232
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:42,560
uh

233
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,160
how about a and s is exactly the same is

234
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,279
a a and s

235
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:49,440
this s is a subset of a

236
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,760
false

237
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,959
true it's true because exactly the same

238
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:57,440
then it's also a subset okay yeah yeah

239
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,720
look this this circle could go as big x

240
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,560
anyway

241
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,760
what subset means the

242
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:06,399
the elements in one set is are all

243
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,560
contained by another set right so this

244
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,279
is right

245
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,240
yeah

246
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,120
yeah

247
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:16,690
okay any questions so fast not really

248
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:19,819
okay okay that's it for today bye-bye

249
