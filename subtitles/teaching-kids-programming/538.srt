1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
why

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:13,620
I keep your balance

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:18,779
so I'll have this date

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:20,760
and what else date adjustment

5
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:25,199
and a balance right

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:27,539
so for example someday and you deposit

7
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,640
a hundred pounds and their balance will

8
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,740
be 100.

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,759
as I promise you I will give you the

10
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,100
interest

11
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:38,579
every month

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,559
am I yeah so three percent remember or

13
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:43,800
four percent yeah if you promise that

14
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:46,559
it's a fixed you're not withdrawing any

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,440
money from the bank from that is for the

16
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,899
next 30 days then the interest rate will

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,120
be four percent right so after a month

18
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:55,260
how much money you get so I'll be

19
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,260
kicking it

20
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,579
100 no balance

21
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,180
four percent

22
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:04,019
that's the interest for a year right for

23
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,119
a year

24
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:07,740
divided by 2f

25
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:11,159
12 months

26
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:13,740
right so after 30 days you'll get these

27
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:17,700
as an interest have you thought about

28
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:19,650
what happened because next 30 days what

29
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,740
happened the next 30 days

30
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,740
[Music]

31
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,740
um

32
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,960
so look this is

33
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:31,159
going to earn Ed in 30 days right

34
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:34,740
so I don't know what number is it a okay

35
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:37,200
so in the next 30 days these entries

36
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:39,000
will be part of your principle right we

37
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,220
call it principal at the beginning your

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,119
principle is a hundred so in this next

39
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:46,500
30 day will be 100 plus a all right this

40
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,740
is your principle

41
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,659
yeah and then times the interest rate

42
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,960
for 30 days four percent

43
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:56,040
divided by 12. right

44
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,600
okay

45
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,520
yeah

46
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,380
so what does it mean it means that your

47
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,460
inches you earn become the principal

48
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:07,979
okay yeah so have you thought about if I

49
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:11,580
give you the interest like

50
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:14,420
every six months every two months every

51
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:17,940
week or every day which one is better

52
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:22,280
every day you can discuss feeling right

53
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,280
okay I go for every

54
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:32,940
Okay so let's make it simplified

55
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,140
suppose you one pound on delis one pound

56
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:37,739
right

57
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:39,360
that's your money yeah one time and I

58
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:43,019
promise you a hundred percent interest

59
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,840
rate 100 meaning that if I calculate

60
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:48,480
your interest once a year in 12 months

61
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,120
what do you get so like look this is

62
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,959
your principle once yearly so how much

63
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,599
money you get a hundred percent uh one

64
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,620
yeah so one plus one that's two that's

65
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,900
your principle that's your interest

66
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:03,480
there but we calculate it once a year so

67
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,280
we've got two how about every

68
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:08,760
six months

69
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,560
every six months one plus

70
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,599
so how do we calculate every six months

71
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,060
in six months five

72
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:16,319
five in six months so you have one

73
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,640
hundred percent right one hundred

74
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:21,060
percent

75
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:25,140
divided by two because every six months

76
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:28,500
it means that there are two two periods

77
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:31,379
in a year right look right to the power

78
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:34,680
of two yeah this is the total money

79
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:37,680
you'll get in a year if we split the

80
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,840
period into two every six months you

81
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,900
know what you need a squad that's a good

82
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:46,379
question how do we get this okay so look

83
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:48,840
here this is six months this is six

84
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:51,480
months this is a year right so this is

85
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,940
at the beginning the first month

86
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:56,400
right one plus one equals two you

87
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:59,640
understand this part right this is easy

88
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,840
right why is that look it's one plus a

89
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,000
hundred percent

90
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:06,239
divided by one that's only one period

91
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,140
right makes sense yes six months one

92
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,560
plus

93
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:11,879
a hundred percent divided by a hundred

94
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,200
percent you're not getting a hundred

95
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:16,139
percent in six months you're getting

96
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,959
half of a hundred percent yeah so you

97
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:21,120
divided by two this is the total money

98
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,880
you will get in

99
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,919
six months right but in the six months

100
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,020
as I said this whole thing becomes the

101
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:31,320
principle again right what do you get

102
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:34,740
here look this one in six months so it's

103
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:39,060
times a hundred percent divided by two

104
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:44,419
right 100 divided by two but also plus

105
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:44,419
one plus times one plus but why time

106
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,759
look this is the principle so basically

107
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:55,320
the interest rate is p times I

108
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:57,259
one plus I okay one plus I

109
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:00,960
interested

110
00:04:57,259 --> 00:05:04,560
one plus I this is the total number of

111
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:09,120
money you get all right so this is the p

112
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:11,220
P times one plus I this is interest rate

113
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,900
right inches like a hundred percent okay

114
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,759
make sense

115
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:17,639
this is the total number of money you

116
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:19,800
get a mile equals P times one plus I do

117
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:22,380
understand this D is the number

118
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:25,740
principle the money you have got now the

119
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:27,900
money you put in the bank one plus I I

120
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:31,860
is the interest rate now I equals one

121
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:35,460
one 100 percent okay

122
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:38,699
so why why this every six months so it's

123
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:41,759
look at six months we get one plus

124
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:43,919
100 divided by two so that becomes a new

125
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,660
principle that's p and then you times

126
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:48,180
and the second half

127
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:53,039
because the interest rate you end

128
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:54,840
in from the month 7 to month 12. this

129
00:05:53,039 --> 00:06:00,180
bit

130
00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:03,539
this is on P which is which equals one

131
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:07,139
plus 100 divided by two right this P

132
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:09,600
here is just one yes

133
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:12,360
makes sense

134
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:15,060
okay so how about if I keep splitting

135
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,880
you know if I calculate the interest so

136
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:21,860
every season is every fourth season so

137
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:24,840
actually this is divided by four and

138
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:26,819
12th I learned here is 12. so do you

139
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:30,060
notice the pattern yeah

140
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:35,100
yeah so it actually means that

141
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:36,840
is one plus one hundred percent divided

142
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:40,080
by n

143
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:43,680
and and if n equals two it means that

144
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:46,800
the whole year you divide into two if n

145
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,860
equals four you divide it into four if n

146
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:54,360
equals 12 you divide by 12. if n equals

147
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:57,600
if n equals 365 we calculate the

148
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:03,000
interest every day right yes and then if

149
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:06,660
360 5 times 24 every hour

150
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,479
times 60 every minute

151
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,919
times 60 every seconds

152
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:13,500
nice

153
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:15,419
how about every milliseconds okay then

154
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:18,300
you keep timing so and

155
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:20,660
and you can increase that so what's the

156
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:23,400
value so the thing is that you said

157
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:24,660
every day is better than every every

158
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,259
month right

159
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:29,699
yeah because again

160
00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:32,819
so look

161
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:36,840
we can define a python functions to do

162
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:41,240
it that's a very simplified F so we just

163
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:43,199
have to pass the N here right so return

164
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:47,400
one plus

165
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:49,080
one divided by n to the power of n right

166
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,940
to the power n

167
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,520
to the power and we talk about that last

168
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:55,620
double star means the to the power or we

169
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:59,280
use the power function right power

170
00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:01,919
function x to the power n yeah

171
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,060
so if we calculate light so what do we

172
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,520
have

173
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:11,419
one two four

174
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:16,740
six twelve 365 365 times 24

175
00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:20,460
365 times 24 times 60. and then 365

176
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:24,060
times 24 times 60 times 60. so what do

177
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:27,120
we have with these values n equals one

178
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:29,759
anyway yes that's two

179
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:33,020
yeah is it increasing

180
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,700
52 weeks 2.692

181
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:38,459
2.714

182
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:40,440
2.718 2.7182

183
00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:42,659
okay

184
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,940
so what have you noticed here from these

185
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:47,640
values here I just particularly at least

186
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:50,220
values using this function

187
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:53,339
um it's increasing right but it has a

188
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:54,540
limit am I right yes

189
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:57,240
yeah

190
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:58,260
even I calculate the interest every

191
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,019
second

192
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:03,180
it's still not going to Infinity

193
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:06,779
right because based on this function

194
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:09,360
yeah one plus one divided by n to the

195
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:14,100
power of n this function has a limit

196
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:17,480
so look 2.718 this converge this value

197
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:21,540
converge to to this

198
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:24,839
2.71 a to a something okay

199
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:27,779
this number irrational

200
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:30,720
there are unlimited numbers of digits

201
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:33,899
Behind These numbers it's like Pi you

202
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,100
know Pi yeah the circle yeah so

203
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:38,399
irrational number you know the

204
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:40,380
irrational number irrational

205
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,680
so this is the mathematic constant a

206
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:45,300
magic number we call it e okay this is

207
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,459
the most important thing to take away

208
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,839
today e

209
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:50,040
okay

210
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:53,040
yeah

211
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:56,100
e is counting how many zeros right

212
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:58,620
now e is the nature and

213
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:02,220
nature

214
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:04,800
in the natural constant e okay okay

215
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:06,899
so what does it mean look so

216
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:11,640
limit

217
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:14,220
when n approaches Infinity all right so

218
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:17,100
we want to calculate this Infinity

219
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:18,720
one plus where do you copy the numbers

220
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:22,200
from

221
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:26,279
this is not e this is not easy this one

222
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:28,260
the easy this one how much is it VCC

223
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:31,500
okay

224
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:34,140
look one plus one divided by n to the

225
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:36,480
power of n okay so the most important

226
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:37,740
thing to take away here look this one to

227
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,300
understand this

228
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,700
when n

229
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:43,019
approaches infinity look you'll

230
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,980
understand this yeah this is infinity

231
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:45,839
here

232
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:48,240
Infinity

233
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:51,720
what is it what does this infinity mean

234
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:54,600
it means carry it going on yeah when n

235
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:57,899
approaches Infinity this this value

236
00:10:54,600 --> 00:11:01,380
one plus one divided by n to the power

237
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:05,760
of n what is this value e e that's what

238
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:06,980
I just said e okay be loud okay so

239
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,899
what's e

240
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:11,880
e is that number

241
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:14,040
but this is never end yeah this never

242
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:16,380
ends this goes repeat and repeat the

243
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,560
number and it's like PI what's pi what's

244
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:21,680
the value of pi

245
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,680
three three

246
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:30,140
and

247
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:30,140
two three

248
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:44,640
okay this is like the numbers I can

249
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:46,200
remember okay remember I put these uh on

250
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,920
the fridge

251
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,920
but you know

252
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:55,079
pi and E those are very special

253
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,440
mathematic constant Never End irrational

254
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:57,440
number

255
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:04,519
like one two

256
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:04,519
zero point five okay

257
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:09,240
the end

258
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,760
this is the number of

259
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,740
the number of the interest paid out

260
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,320
right so one is that you pay our

261
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:17,220
interest in one year two is they pay out

262
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,760
twice

263
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:22,079
inches so it's payout four interest

264
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:25,860
six

265
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:30,180
inches 12 12 inches right so this is

266
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:32,940
monthly this every two months this is

267
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:35,100
uh every three months every six months

268
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,440
every 12 months we increase the number

269
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:39,660
of payouts

270
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:42,720
365 means that we calculate the interest

271
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:44,279
every day and then the a this is the

272
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,019
number of money we can get in one year

273
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:48,600
is it better

274
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:50,040
to calculate the interest rate daily or

275
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:55,019
monthly

276
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:55,019
n is how much yeah interested

277
00:12:56,279 --> 00:13:01,139
in Daily

278
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:04,019
this one is every second

279
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:05,820
every minute every hour

280
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:09,480
every day

281
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:13,500
every week every month every two months

282
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:17,160
every three months every six months

283
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:19,740
every year every year look one two

284
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:23,279
yeah remember you've got one one pound

285
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:25,260
the interest rate is 100 in 12 months in

286
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:29,160
a year you've got two pounds right one

287
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:32,820
is interest rate if we split it into two

288
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:35,040
you got 2.25 and girls larger the egg

289
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:37,320
the number of money gets larger but if

290
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:40,320
there's a limit it's not Infinity right

291
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:44,459
that's what it is here so when n

292
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:47,279
approaches Infinity yeah look this end

293
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:49,740
approach Infinity yeah

294
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,839
you're not getting infinity money you're

295
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:54,000
only getting the E you converts to e

296
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,800
which is this number of money so it

297
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,959
means that you have one dollar the

298
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:00,360
interest rate is 100 percent

299
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:02,279
the maximum you can get

300
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:05,180
from the bank

301
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:08,639
is this Lambda e okay

302
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:10,459
2.718 you only have to remember these

303
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:14,600
three digits

304
00:14:10,459 --> 00:14:18,660
yeah this is the number you need to do

305
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:20,399
the rest we don't care okay two points

306
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:23,100
of one eight two eight one seven seven

307
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:25,260
eight four six eight nine

308
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:28,139
yeah and I look the person is good yeah

309
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:31,040
one plus one divided by n times n this

310
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:31,040
is to the power okay

311
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:40,800
we have the bank and and so we we're

312
00:14:36,139 --> 00:14:41,820
doing the interest and it we're going

313
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,940
like

314
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:48,600
um like daily

315
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:51,300
daily we're doing daily

316
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,220
um second minute uh

317
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:54,000
the monthly

318
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:56,579
um

319
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,060
everything around

320
00:14:56,579 --> 00:15:02,820
every three months

321
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:05,820
every six months and every year and

322
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:10,680
and sober

323
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:14,579
so the result is like um it's easier to

324
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:18,600
calculate every year because

325
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:25,740
because uh like every

326
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:28,920
second you uh see because uh

327
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:31,320
the bottomans has more numbers to it a

328
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:32,399
equals P to times one plus I what what's

329
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:36,360
P

330
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:38,839
uh yeah so after a month what happened

331
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,839
to p

332
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:44,220
increases after 30 days the T includes

333
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,360
the interest you end on the first month

334
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:48,899
all right

335
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:52,500
yeah so that's why the more

336
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:54,360
of n the more of the a because P

337
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,699
increases

338
00:15:54,360 --> 00:16:00,560
