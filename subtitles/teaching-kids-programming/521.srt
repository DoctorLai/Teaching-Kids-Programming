1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,240
hello mr ray mr am i right yes we given

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,480
this uh two dimensional matrix okay so

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,320
you can pick the numbers for simplicity

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,800
let's assume all the numbers are

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,800
positive

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,440
will become more complicated if we allow

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,640
the negative numbers okay just for

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,240
simplicity

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:24,560
we allow the numbers only to be positive

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,519
and the test is very simple just pick

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,300
the numbers once you pick one number you

12
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:33,420
can you can add

13
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,420
[Music]

14
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,640
obviously yeah you can't pick the

15
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,440
numbers next to it

16
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,840
okay so you'll be disappearing around it

17
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,239
sorry you mean around it

18
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,960
yeah and also because that's not next to

19
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,879
it

20
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,480
okay let me rephrase when you pick the

21
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,719
numbers in the first row you can pick

22
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,960
any number in the second row or in any

23
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,600
number above it for example like

24
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:05,119
yeah you can't put any number above it

25
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,040
so this row well if we pick this number

26
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:10,000
these roll these the numbers you can't

27
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,240
pick it and also the numbers next to it

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,640
so these two numbers one and six you can

29
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,520
pick it but you can pick five

30
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,320
i don't get like what how you just

31
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,000
do the like lines you cross them out so

32
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,000
you can't use them that's right you

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
can't tell me you can't use one seven

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,840
six five nine

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,640
okay so let me repeat when we pick a

36
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,960
number we can't pick the numbers that uh

37
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,920
in the adjacent lines so if we pick any

38
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,759
numbers in this this row we can pick any

39
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,360
like all the numbers in the next line

40
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:44,159
and all the numbers in the above lines

41
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,920
okay and also one addition requirements

42
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,560
that we can't pick the numbers on the

43
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,920
same row next to it right so two

44
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,079
requirements

45
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,840
first of all if we pick the number at

46
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,560
the

47
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,880
row

48
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,200
column now we'll pick this number if we

49
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,880
pick this we can't pick any of the

50
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,759
numbers

51
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,880
at

52
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,320
row minus 1 and row

53
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,879
plus one

54
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,920
and also we can pick the two numbers

55
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,720
at

56
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,400
row the same row yeah column minus one

57
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,040
and row

58
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,920
column plus one we want to maximize the

59
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,520
sum

60
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,640
this is the requirement when we pick a

61
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,360
number we can't pick any numbers that in

62
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,520
the above row and in the next row we

63
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,480
can't keep any num the two numbers

64
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:33,519
basically and uh next to it so you know

65
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,640
the one on the right and one immediately

66
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,879
on the left

67
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,879
so for example if you pick one

68
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:41,599
then i can't get anything here

69
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,040
what's the maximum you can get here

70
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,400
22

71
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:49,360
why which one is 20 um seven five eight

72
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,440
two wow okay any more bigger than that

73
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,720
okay seven five one two okay so look if

74
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,879
you pick this one you can pick this one

75
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,440
but not anything yeah

76
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,599
does it have to be three times four

77
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,239
no yeah good question the metric could

78
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,319
be any size so the thing here is i want

79
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,360
to pick this number all the numbers next

80
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,280
to it

81
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,440
right so these two numbers just just

82
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,599
disappear right we can think of it

83
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,959
disappearing when you pick this number

84
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,519
all the numbers in the next row

85
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,159
discipline if we pick this number all

86
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,720
the numbers above it disappearing and

87
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,319
all the numbers below it disappearing

88
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,760
okay yeah

89
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,959
this is two dimensional okay we're

90
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,720
picking it in the middle

91
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,200
we'll pick the middle sorry see if we

92
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,159
can do it so if you have a free time

93
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,519
free one and you pick the number in the

94
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:41,120
middle it's useless

95
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:43,519
it's use this if you no no no sorry for

96
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,599
example if i'm here like i put a minion

97
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,200
here obviously you want this yeah you

98
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,599
want to pick up media and not know the

99
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,599
numbers i don't care because all this is

100
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,640
the biggest right yeah

101
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,280
okay

102
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:58,280
yeah but what if it's like this

103
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,280
um

104
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:15,280
so we talked about a one-dimensional

105
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:18,320
problem haven't we

106
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:22,800
remember that a street there's a street

107
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:25,680
a street each house has some money in it

108
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,320
some money yeah

109
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,919
and you want to go yeah i see if you

110
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:35,360
want to you know steer from the houses

111
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:37,520
the thief can't steer two adjacent

112
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,479
houses otherwise the police will be

113
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,120
caught

114
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:43,840
the alarm will fire off and remember

115
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,000
this this is one dimension right so in

116
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:50,000
that problem we want to find out the

117
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,520
maximum sum of non-adjacent numbers

118
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,360
right

119
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:57,840
yeah so for example one two three four

120
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,840
five right one two three four five

121
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,840
so we want to pick the sums pick the

122
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:06,160
numbers that sum up to the maximum but

123
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,639
we don't want to pick the numbers that

124
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,720
next to each other if we pick two we can

125
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,479
pick one and three but we can pick four

126
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,360
or pick five

127
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:17,440
at the time we we talk about five sorry

128
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,960
i'll pick five yeah but you can pick

129
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,400
more so pick five three three

130
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,280
one one

131
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,199
yeah that's maximum right i'm right

132
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,919
yeah like that's eleven yeah that's

133
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:32,320
eleven that's the maximum you can get

134
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,840
okay so we talked about that remember uh

135
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,000
we talked about the dynamic programming

136
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,400
here we use this one dimension now

137
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,400
how is that useful on how is that useful

138
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,720
if this is one dimensional if i'm saying

139
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,000
this is one row okay

140
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,160
one row

141
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,600
if i'm saying this f row

142
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,759
returns the

143
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,880
largest

144
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:51,680
non-adjacent sum

145
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,639
right

146
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,880
if i'm saying that f row returns the

147
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,759
largest non-adjacent sum for the row for

148
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,080
this row so how is that useful this is

149
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,759
2d this is 1d

150
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,840
if we are looking at this what's the

151
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,240
largest non-adjacent adjacent just for

152
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,919
this one if we can pick two numbers

153
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,199
next to each other what's the largest

154
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,520
sum you can pick

155
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,520
here

156
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:21,520
seven five okay 12

157
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,759
what's the largest sum here

158
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,759
um

159
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,000
12 12 nine yeah

160
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,479
12

161
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,390
these two yeah these two yeah what's the

162
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,160
largest sum here

163
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:36,080
[Music]

164
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,520
um ten

165
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,199
ten yeah

166
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,400
ten a and two okay

167
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,479
okay now

168
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,919
looking at this one dimension low by row

169
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,039
we know this yeah

170
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,680
okay

171
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,560
so what about these three numbers 12 12

172
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,000
10.

173
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,639
it's the same we can apply the same

174
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,720
equivalent again right 12 12 10 what's

175
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,960
the largest sum you can get it's like

176
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,759
210 yeah

177
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,840
22. so another term is 22. if we pick

178
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,840
this

179
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,840
all the numbers next to it disappearing

180
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,919
the number on the left disappearing the

181
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,080
number on the right disappearing because

182
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,000
on each row we can't keep two numbers in

183
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,400
the row right so we can apply this

184
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,599
aggregate the police and rubber problem

185
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,120
one

186
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:21,520
so look at this we can get two f if by

187
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,759
looking at this row only if we can get

188
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,639
12 on the second row we can take ten one

189
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,800
zero always pick this number the number

190
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,759
all the numbers next to it

191
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,960
the above and below on the

192
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:37,520
adjacent rows will disappear right so it

193
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,599
means that if we pick the number 12 here

194
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,960
we can pick any of the numbers on the

195
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,919
next row right

196
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,599
yeah

197
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,400
so it means that we can apply this all

198
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,520
right two three five

199
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,240
seven

200
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,720
six one two three

201
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:56,000
two one two four

202
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:58,800
three six seven two okay what's the

203
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,919
largest long adjacent sound if you can

204
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,400
find

205
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:05,039
pick in this matrix

206
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,039
what's the sound

207
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:15,680
okay so what's the first one you can get

208
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:17,680
what's the sum of the largest languages

209
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,039
now just look at the first row what's

210
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,720
the 10

211
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,560
yes this is 10 yeah

212
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:26,800
so it's 10

213
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:29,520
it's 10. okay what's the second one

214
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,039
nine right i can pick this and this nine

215
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,000
right

216
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,000
what's the third one

217
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:42,479
six six what's the last

218
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:44,080
one okay now

219
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,920
given this

220
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:50,080
what's the maximum you can pick 20 20.

221
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,760
so it means that we can get 20 by

222
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,800
picking

223
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,399
this one

224
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,040
this one

225
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:59,040
this one this one yeah is this

226
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,920
satisfying requirement if we pick this

227
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,560
number

228
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,959
we can't pick any of these and not this

229
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,720
one we can pick this one not this one if

230
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:09,279
you pick this number we don't pick any

231
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,519
of those yeah we can't pick any notes

232
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,519
yeah so the set is very equivalent yeah

233
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,920
got it

234
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,959
largest sum

235
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,000
of

236
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,560
noun

237
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
how do you spell adjacent

238
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:26,399
j a c and d f

239
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,399
numbers

240
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,480
we talk about

241
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,040
a different solutions the core idea is

242
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:36,240
the dynamic programming fi

243
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:38,720
means that the largest sum that if we're

244
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,560
looking at the from the beginning to the

245
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:44,720
i

246
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:47,360
number so f i equals maximum

247
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,200
for this number yeah look

248
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,680
there are few numbers

249
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,720
this is ice number yeah if we're looking

250
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,839
at this f i what does it equal is equals

251
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,839
to

252
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,360
f i

253
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,720
minus

254
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,600
1 right

255
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,880
this one but once we have this we can

256
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,920
pick b

257
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,040
right

258
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,560
or f i minus 2

259
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,000
if we pick here

260
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:16,240
then we can have these plus nums

261
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,040
i right

262
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:22,079
if we pick this number

263
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:26,000
we can pick this but we can't pick it

264
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:28,560
so f i equals the the maximum of

265
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,440
f i minus 2 plus this number

266
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,640
right

267
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,640
or f

268
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,120
i minus one i know this is dynamic

269
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,200
programming yeah we're remembering is fi

270
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,240
we don't need to calculate it again and

271
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,279
again

272
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,079
so i'm just going to write a

273
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,560
uh

274
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,800
iterative version of it yeah and you can

275
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,640
do it in the

276
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,959
top-down dynamic programming or

277
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,600
bottom-up dynamic programming and then

278
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,399
this is much more like a fibonacci

279
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,320
number

280
00:10:54,399 --> 00:11:01,040
define f

281
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:02,880
numbers and equals the length of numbers

282
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:06,079
if n equal

283
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:09,360
0 returns 0 nothing that will return 0

284
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:12,839
if and equal equal 1 if there's only one

285
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:16,560
number then we return it return numbers

286
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:22,000
here okay then

287
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:24,320
a b equals 0 0 for i in

288
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,320
num

289
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:32,320
a b equals the b maximum a this is the

290
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,399
first number plus i and b

291
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,600
and return

292
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,680
b

293
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,760
the idea is that we're going through

294
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,640
every time a and b

295
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,399
a means the numbers that the largest sum

296
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,480
we can get by

297
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,000
picking this number and the numbers

298
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,320
priority

299
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,600
to it but not including the immediate

300
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,440
previous one

301
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,200
b is the largest sum

302
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,800
by picking the previous number but

303
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,920
obviously we're gonna pick the

304
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,480
one okay

305
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,480
so once we have this f function for this

306
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,399
two dimensional and we can just return

307
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,200
max return

308
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,720
f

309
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,519
r

310
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,720
for

311
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:14,160
r in original metric

312
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,600
then we apply this again with an f well

313
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:19,200
we

314
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,399
calculate the sum of each row

315
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,760
and

316
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,240
then

317
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:25,360
[Music]

318
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:28,079
and then what

319
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,120
so we calculated this largest sum

320
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:32,320
you know how to solve this

321
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:35,200
one-dimensional problem right

322
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,160
you're applying this as a function

323
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,959
right

324
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:41,839
yeah and then you um calculate the sum

325
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:43,440
of each row and then and then you

326
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,200
and then you

327
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,399
calculate um

328
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,120
the

329
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:51,279
the greatest sum of

330
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,279
the

331
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,999
[Music]

332
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,360
why can we do this first of all what do

333
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,350
we need to do with these numbers

334
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,880
um

335
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:08,880
[Music]

336
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,920
you um like

337
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:14,560
if you pick a number you can't use the

338
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,560
left or right to it

339
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,839
so

340
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:22,800
and you can't use the row

341
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:24,000
below so the sun works as

342
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,839
like

343
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,200
it's not next

344
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:30,320
to each other like um

345
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,200
a day

346
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,200
whatever situation

347
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:37,619
[Music]

348
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,000
so there are two requirements so let's

349
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:46,079
look at each row so if we pick one

350
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,079
number we can pick two numbers next to

351
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,920
it right so that's the

352
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,920
one-dimensional problem of the please

353
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,880
the sieve problem right

354
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,360
all right

355
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:58,000
and then if we have this the largest sum

356
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:01,040
for each law particularly we can apply

357
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,720
this uh aggregate to it because the if

358
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,880
we pick one number from firstly we

359
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,519
complete any number of the second law

360
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,360
right so if you look at the that way

361
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,760
perspective then that's another

362
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,320
dimension of the police uh and you'll

363
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:17,120
see what they're right above exactly so

364
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,560
the takeaway today is that if we we are

365
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,320
solving this kind of problem we can

366
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,959
apply this one thing

367
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,720
solution twice to solve it

368
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:27,519
am right ryan what have you learned

369
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,720
today about numbers what do we do with

370
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,880
the numbers

371
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,639
get try to get the biggest number so

372
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,000
what are the requirements when we pick a

373
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,800
number you can't

374
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,760
if you pick one number you can't pick

375
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:43,199
the number on the left or right or the

376
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:46,320
right above or below yeah don't worry

377
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:48,560
so we want to find out the largest sum

378
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,959
for the long adjection

379
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,839
numbers of each rows right and those

380
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:55,760
numbers then we can apply it again

381
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,480
so for example least the largest sum for

382
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:01,279
the first row is

383
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:04,000
is one eight right

384
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:06,320
with eight so i'm gonna put a here

385
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,279
the last sum of the second row is

386
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,400
fourteen forty the last sum of third row

387
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,399
is

388
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,199
[Music]

389
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,680
10

390
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:19,519
the last number to fall right

391
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,519
i know what what to do with this person

392
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:24,160
oh yeah yeah sorry

393
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,480
yeah all right okay

394
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:30,079
so it doesn't matter anyway so what that

395
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:33,040
what do we do with these numbers add two

396
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:35,360
the two um greatest numbers which is in

397
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:38,720
this case fourteen and ten

398
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,639
and then you add a mark 14 and ten

399
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:44,720
why for the intent i pick 14 i can't fit

400
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:46,560
10. oh yeah so what are the numbers

401
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,560
10 and 8

402
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,399
10 yeah okay

403
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,839
because we pick any number of the second

404
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,920
we complete any number of the zero so

405
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:55,600
if we

406
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,920
transpose it

407
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,519
we just have to apply this again this is

408
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:04,320
how we solve in the one dimension all

409
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:07,680
right f i equals maximum of

410
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:11,040
f i minus 2

411
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:15,519
or f i minus 1 plus

412
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:18,160
f i minus 2 plus the numbers at i

413
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:20,480
okay and this time complexity is one so

414
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:24,720
we applying these twice the time

415
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,600
complexity is t o n right so o n o n o n

416
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,920
o n

417
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:31,070
i don't get this number o m okay that's

418
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:34,179
it for today bye bye

419
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:34,179
[Applause]
