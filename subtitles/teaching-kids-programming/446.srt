1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
hello mr miss narayan okay so today we

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:07,440
want to talk about how to check if a

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,599
graph this is given uh this kind of data

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,639
structure to represent the

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,240
graph likes and we want to find out if

6
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,680
this is actually tree detection

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,880
algorithm okay this index means zero

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,760
one

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,760
two

10
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,480
three okay so we have

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,680
we have four notes neighbors zero one

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,240
two three

13
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,279
so look zero the left over zero is one

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,880
okay

15
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:37,920
one the left the right of zero is two

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,920
okay the left of one is when is minus

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,920
one it means that it's

18
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,399
it doesn't have a the kid the kid is

19
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,399
known okay so we skip

20
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:50,719
one doesn't have the left three

21
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:52,640
right right uh one of the ones right is

22
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,520
none right

23
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,399
two

24
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,440
the left of the two is three

25
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,480
the right of the two is nothing okay and

26
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,879
then four

27
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,720
here the left of three is nothing the

28
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,560
right and right of three is nothing so

29
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,280
it's at least a tree

30
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,960
given this okay

31
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,840
yeah

32
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,040
yeah look the left of zero

33
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,320
is one

34
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,479
the right of zero is two the left of one

35
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,119
is minus one which means nothing the

36
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,240
right or minus one is not minus one is

37
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,200
nothing

38
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,479
uh the of one okay is not minus one the

39
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,720
left of the

40
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,960
the left of two

41
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,360
is three the right of two is nothing

42
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,280
minus one okay and a three the left of

43
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,119
three is nothing but right of three is

44
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,000
nothing so this is this

45
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,640
trick is this a tree

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,159
very obviously is it

47
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,680
this is not a trick question is this

48
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,799
about a tree

49
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,680
yeah

50
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:54,040
yeah

51
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,040
maybe what do you mean maybe

52
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:58,379
[Music]

53
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,160
you're quite picky okay so tell about

54
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,800
this

55
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,120
because one of them looks very circle

56
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,319
okay so don't worry about the notation

57
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,239
it's just you don't want to there's

58
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,239
three four notes connected by this way

59
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,080
this is the final trick it's a it's a

60
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,200
tree it's a binary look left or right

61
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,080
okay

62
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,760
so

63
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,239
in order to

64
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,840
to be a tree what kind of thing we are

65
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:34,090
looking for

66
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:39,840
in order to be a tree everywhere anybody

67
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:39,840
[Music]

68
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,480
in one piece yeah you can't have like

69
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,879
another one here that's not a tree okay

70
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,879
these are

71
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,680
cycles foreign down so so we can't have

72
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,800
any energy we can't do this right this

73
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,400
is not a three this is one okay anything

74
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,599
is

75
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,159
one root

76
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,480
one root okay so it's kind of like if

77
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,239
you have two roots it means that

78
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,480
and you know

79
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,800
if it means not connected so it's kind

80
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,120
of here okay if i put it here right it's

81
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,680
one thing whether anymore no

82
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,080
[Music]

83
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,640
i think okay so we're talking about this

84
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,680
undirected graph yeah under the ground

85
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,280
uh

86
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,640
it needs to be

87
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,159
clean

88
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:31,360
and actually actually it has directions

89
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,360
from parents to the kids

90
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,480
so yeah so how do we do this yeah so

91
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,879
first of all you mentioned about the

92
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,879
root so the idea is that we need to find

93
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,640
the rule first right so if we find the

94
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,440
root

95
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,599
if we find the root then we can do this

96
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,519
breakfast starts your diagnosis right

97
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,439
what's the perfect search of these these

98
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,680
three anyone this is easy question

99
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,760
what's the difference zero one two three

100
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,400
okay what's the

101
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,400
what do i say

102
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,879
zero one two three zero one two three

103
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,480
okay uh

104
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,400
the preference search level by level

105
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,319
therefore search you go down

106
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,599
as deep as you can and if not no

107
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,400
breakfast

108
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,479
do you use food okay we are given this

109
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,600
formula how do we find the root

110
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:23,759
possibly

111
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,120
so we need to count the one one thing

112
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,440
what is this

113
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,520
the number of what kind of egg is coming

114
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:33,120
what what is it called

115
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:35,120
in degree where down in degree in degree

116
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,199
so this is the number of this is the

117
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,440
edges that going in so if we go through

118
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,560
these then we find that in degree first

119
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,720
of all we go final in degree equals one

120
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,960
equals zero then that's a number yeah if

121
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,840
we find that uh if we find

122
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,000
there are two roots or zero roots

123
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,400
what does it mean it means that we can

124
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,800
just return right because it in order to

125
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,880
be a graph to be a tree it needs to be

126
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,600
exactly having one one it needs to be

127
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:04,000
exactly one node that doesn't have any

128
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,600
in degree uh it doesn't have any uh edge

129
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,120
coming in okay and now we can do this

130
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,240
break for such stafford search and we

131
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:13,120
can can find out the number of nodes the

132
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,880
number of nodes visited is exactly

133
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,080
i know okay

134
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,650
we find

135
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,880
three different detections

136
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:24,960
[Music]

137
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,479
we have this left and right okay

138
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,479
so we are given this difference right

139
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,880
first of all we need to get this n n is

140
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,639
the number of nodes right lens left on

141
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,080
that right

142
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,080
it should be the same yeah the both

143
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,120
arrays will have the same size okay and

144
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,360
then

145
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,800
we have we can count the number of

146
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:46,479
in-degree edges so let's do it in uh

147
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,880
in the data okay in the data data

148
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,240
before this is the integrator before

149
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,360
dictionary

150
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:56,000
default dictionary in

151
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,319
okay and then we go through for i

152
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,680
in range

153
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,199
and right

154
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,520
so look if

155
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,759
if the left eye

156
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,319
not equal minus one right there's no

157
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:11,039
point to count the integral of nothing

158
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:14,560
right if left i not equals one then

159
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,600
theta alright right

160
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,120
left

161
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,360
i

162
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,840
plus equal one okay

163
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,639
okay third one

164
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:27,039
is right you're man

165
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:30,160
what am i writing here if right i not

166
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,199
equals minus one your writing if right

167
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,280
eye

168
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,680
okay and right

169
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:40,080
i mind eric can you tell me what i'm

170
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:42,240
doing here from this line here to here

171
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,919
guess what does it mean plus equal one

172
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,160
we are counting what

173
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,479
i know theta is addition so we are we

174
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,560
are iterating over the

175
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:53,599
nodes and then

176
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:56,479
because left i is the lesson trial of

177
00:06:53,599 --> 00:07:00,639
the node i and now we we increment this

178
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:02,479
by one what does it mean the number of

179
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,479
in degree yes we are look we are we are

180
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,960
updating the in degree weather okay in

181
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,880
degree here so now we want to find out

182
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:12,080
the rule there's a root

183
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,880
root that would be equal i for

184
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,479
i

185
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:19,440
in range and

186
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,919
if is what so we are going we we have

187
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,520
this note from 0 to n minus 1 but we

188
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,000
want to check if

189
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,280
if the data

190
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
data i

191
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:32,240
in degree equals 0 right look here right

192
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,680
this is the loop right at least

193
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,680
maybe empty

194
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,599
or you may have more we may have more

195
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,880
than one root right look this is the

196
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:44,080
least yeah for i in range i if theta i

197
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,840
theta i is the indegree of i equals zero

198
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,400
right

199
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,080
right yeah what does this equal zero

200
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,039
mean

201
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,960
delta i equals zero anybody

202
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,190
come on i will just say beta i equals

203
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,319
zero

204
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:00,319
[Music]

205
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:08,560
[Music]

206
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,479
the in degree is nothing it's nothing so

207
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,440
there's no edge going in so that's a

208
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:15,199
loop okay so look if if the length of

209
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,919
the root

210
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,599
is not equal one then we need to return

211
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,400
what

212
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:25,199
if the root if if we find more than one

213
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,879
root or if we find no root

214
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,840
right if we find no root what does it

215
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,440
mean there's a cycle right 0 1 2

216
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,919
something like that

217
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:37,200
there's no note each node has

218
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:39,039
has some in degree right yeah so

219
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,360
if it's zero it means this kind of

220
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:43,919
situation if it's more than one it means

221
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,080
what something like that right

222
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,399
right even more than one so

223
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,040
so these two are not trees so what

224
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,040
should we return

225
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:57,200
nothing false okay

226
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,240
okay yeah so now we know to find the

227
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,399
rule

228
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,399
that zero will be the root yeah then we

229
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,959
do this breakfast search here or another

230
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,950
way we can do this we can turn this

231
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:10,109
we can turn the root they say this

232
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:10,109
[Music]

233
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,120
iterator boot

234
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,200
and then we do this next then you give

235
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,240
us the loop this is basically the same

236
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,399
thing okay

237
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,480
we turning this the list into iterator

238
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,640
and we put it to the next this is the

239
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,399
syntax of

240
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,800
you know sensing syntax

241
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,480
but as long as we know it's only one

242
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,240
element here so then we can do this

243
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,320
loser okay then we do this preference

244
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,160
search okay question search what kind of

245
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,120
data social can we use to implement

246
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,720
buffer sensors right

247
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,720
i i think you know this question

248
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,320
question search

249
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,120
what kind of data structure can we use

250
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,920
to

251
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:52,480
kill yes and in python

252
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:55,360
wow good job okay q equals d e q u e

253
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:58,000
first of all we put the load in okay the

254
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,839
zero okay put a little zero

255
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,440
or you can do this again the same thing

256
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,360
and then we need to have this thing

257
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,560
equal step headshot

258
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,600
okay

259
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:11,920
now y q easy

260
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,190
current equals q dot problem

261
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,560
okay and then

262
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:18,959
[Music]

263
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:21,279
if okay if current in sin right we have

264
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:23,839
seen this before then we need to return

265
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:25,839
first right why is that because look if

266
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,160
we've seen we have seen this now before

267
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,000
that means lesser cycle and right so

268
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,839
that's why we seen it so we didn't talk

269
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,680
otherwise we need to put it in the same

270
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,519
table let's see in the headset it's a

271
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:39,279
notebook okay

272
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:41,600
a sim dot add carbon

273
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:44,480
okay then if

274
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,360
it was if left

275
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,920
left current not equals minus one and we

276
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,040
push this q dot append

277
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,959
up and

278
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:57,440
left parallel right then if right curve

279
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:59,360
and not equals one then q dot apparently

280
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,519
i don't have enough space but you know

281
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,399
what i'm talking about right

282
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:06,800
i okay that's just the question here

283
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,240
here is the breakfast search

284
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,320
bfs

285
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,880
here this is counting the in degree

286
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,560
updating the integration updating the in

287
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,200
degree

288
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,200
in degree

289
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:23,279
of the notes okay and then after if all

290
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:26,000
all are released then we need to return

291
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:29,680
return length of the scene we want to

292
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:33,360
find out the the note we have visited is

293
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:35,920
equals to the n right this is the

294
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,720
number of nodes we've given in the graph

295
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,800
right

296
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,720
everywhere come on

297
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:44,720
yes

298
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:46,320
any any questions so far any questions

299
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,640
no okay

300
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,959
okay so uh can you okay one last

301
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:53,760
question can you tell me how do we

302
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:56,639
how do we check uh

303
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:59,760
how do we check that no the node has

304
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:02,639
been visited or not how do we check

305
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,440
which line is the data structure we use

306
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,600
to

307
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,279
to check to put the nodes that we have

308
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,519
visited

309
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,200
come on it's very obvious here okay let

310
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,519
me see

311
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,519
and this is the set

312
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:20,399
stop

313
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:23,839
okay here look set set okay set

314
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:26,720
okay if it's exactly now

315
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:29,440
okay and if not we put it in a

316
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,440
in a headset

317
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,160
okay that's it for today bye bye

318
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,639
bye bye

319
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,639
okay that's it
