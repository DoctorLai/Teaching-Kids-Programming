1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,600
hello mr and mr ryan all right we have

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,559
an array to

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,840
represent a list of meetings and then we

4
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,240
want to find out if

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,759
a person if you can attend all the

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,840
meetings right so for example like we so

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,240
for simplicity okay so we just use the

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,560
number to represent the time of the

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,400
meeting start and end for example like

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,640
we have a meeting like

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,599
start at one and a ten

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,519
another meeting at start at 20

13
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,800
finish at 70.

14
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:37,440
can we attend all the meetings

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,280
yeah because i can attend i can attend

16
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,800
this meeting one to ten and then go in

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,079
order

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,160
okay that's a very good question it

19
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,480
doesn't have to be necessary you know

20
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,680
that's for example if i give you like

21
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,559
three

22
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,800
five and then i give you another one

23
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,719
four can we attend

24
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,480
all the meetings why is that

25
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,239
because so

26
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,840
why why we can't attend these two main

27
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,000
things that you know let's put this

28
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,080
number the meetings

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,920
in this line right this is zero okay so

30
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,040
one two four

31
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,080
one

32
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,880
two

33
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,200
three

34
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,920
four one two four one four so

35
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,520
this meeting is start the duration is

36
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,400
here right wonderful another another

37
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,400
meeting three to five

38
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,880
so another meeting

39
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,439
three to five okay so look

40
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,119
we have an overlap so if two meetings

41
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,680
have overlapped we can't attend all of

42
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:32,320
them right okay so and another thing is

43
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,960
that if we we we can attend the meeting

44
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,280
immediately right so for example like

45
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,680
after right so for example zero one and

46
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,520
then only finish the first meeting we

47
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,680
can have this attend the second meeting

48
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,759
from one to two yeah that's what i mean

49
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,600
it has to be in order to be

50
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,040
you know

51
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,399
okay you mentioned a very good point

52
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,759
order so

53
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,240
yeah so we can

54
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,799
all the we can solve this array right so

55
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,439
to make a solid array in by the time by

56
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,920
the start time okay so what's your

57
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:04,960
thoughts in this so

58
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,799
so um how do we check if the person can

59
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,959
attend all the meetings

60
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:13,200
you mentioned a very good one so how do

61
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,200
we check there are two ways basically

62
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,840
you know how do we check how how we

63
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,319
first yeah proof of how to improve us we

64
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,920
have end meetings so we want to check if

65
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,920
the person can attend all the meetings

66
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,879
so how can we prove us what are we

67
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,959
checking exactly so

68
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,959
so yeah i know then the question is how

69
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,879
do we check all the if the person can

70
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,360
attend all the meetings how do we check

71
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:39,519
it i mean we want to find out what there

72
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,599
are meetings so this is a way all right

73
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,280
this is all the meetings meeting meeting

74
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,680
array

75
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,480
and it's an array of arrays and each

76
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,959
each array each separate way is has

77
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,879
has two numbers one for the star term

78
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,200
the other one for the end term

79
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,200
um

80
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,760
so what is this

81
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,800
what are we checking i mean what are

82
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,560
which is

83
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,599
of what come on you're not you're not

84
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,560
answering

85
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,159
right

86
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,920
yeah you're not answering the question

87
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,159
directly so what i'm what are we

88
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,319
checking so if we find out in what kind

89
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,400
of if two meetings what then we can

90
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:19,040
attend all the meetings

91
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,959
okay

92
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,239
so what's what's it called so what

93
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,640
what's this

94
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,480
intersect yeah so we we want to find out

95
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,879
so let's we're going to find out if

96
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,200
there are two meetings that overlap each

97
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,040
other if i overlap then we can attend on

98
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,480
the meeting right this is overlapping

99
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,080
okay

100
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,519
make sense

101
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,519
so

102
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,120
with overlapping it's very easy right so

103
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,440
we if not n

104
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,360
n meetings when we need to prove us the

105
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,959
time complexity will be what

106
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,280
if we want to check any two what's the

107
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,799
potential that's even o n square where

108
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,200
that one square

109
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,360
and then we just have to say for i in

110
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,400
range n for j in range

111
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:01,280
for j in range i right now including i

112
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,680
if if meeting if overlapped meeting i

113
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,920
meeting j then written fourth right

114
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,439
otherwise written two right this is o n

115
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,840
square right so

116
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:12,239
how about look ryan you mentioned a very

117
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,799
good point to sort it in order if we saw

118
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,680
the meetings in order by the start time

119
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,680
right

120
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:21,759
so look at this meeting how do we find

121
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:24,080
out look if this is meeting in order 1 4

122
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,080
5 6

123
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,880
okay 6 7

124
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,720
6 8

125
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,720
seven nine okay can we attend all the

126
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,160
meetings here do we have a lower left

127
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,479
here yeah

128
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,040
six a yeah lesser media okay so listen

129
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:41,680
overlap so how do we find out look if we

130
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:44,720
saw this array by the start time one

131
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,720
five six seven

132
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,880
then how do we check we just have to

133
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,240
check the ending the meeting ending of

134
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,840
the current meeting

135
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,240
if it's bigger

136
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,639
than the starting of next meeting then

137
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,560
there will be overlap right look six

138
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,880
eight eight yeah

139
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,680
color meeting ends at eight right but

140
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,400
the next meeting starts at seven

141
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,919
like this is seven

142
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,320
yeah that's good look

143
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,880
six if it's

144
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,960
okay so we can just finish and straight

145
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,320
go to the next one but let's probably

146
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,759
get a rook a

147
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,240
the end of a

148
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,800
but the next meeting starts seven

149
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,720
okay so what does this mean

150
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,120
if the overlapping will turn fast easy

151
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,039
yeah what's the time complexity here

152
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,840
first of all we thought and the next one

153
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:34,800
again we're down good that's very good

154
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,479
because look we saw this array oh and

155
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,479
again and then

156
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,800
the second first of all we saw the array

157
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:43,280
the next the second one the second pass

158
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,000
we just go through the meetings in order

159
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,919
we check if the current end

160
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,240
time is bigger

161
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,160
than the start and the next meeting then

162
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,440
if it is then that's the overlap will

163
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,360
determine i don't know all retention

164
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,240
yeah easy okay

165
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,400
yeah

166
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,759
so which one is better come on

167
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,479
that one

168
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:05,680
that is first one second one

169
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:07,440
yeah this is better than that right yeah

170
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,319
okay so now

171
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,960
let's implement this should be quick

172
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:15,360
and easy yeah define

173
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,240
can attend okay a 10

174
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:21,039
attempt okay meeting let's use n

175
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,800
first of all n equals the length meeting

176
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:27,360
then m the saw so yeah oh and again this

177
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,120
is one of them yeah but we want to start

178
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,720
by default it's solved by the first

179
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,479
element which is the start time but if

180
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,360
you want to be specific you can say

181
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,639
thought

182
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,319
so by what key equals what p equals num

183
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:42,160
da

184
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,919
x x zero x zero x zero is the first

185
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,800
number which is the

186
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,400
which is the start okay let's

187
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,120
that's the sorting and now we need to go

188
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,639
through for i in

189
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,520
range

190
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,479
right right range to n minus one

191
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,000
yeah

192
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,599
now if

193
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,360
if the meeting

194
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,160
i

195
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,000
and

196
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,080
for the the second value will be the end

197
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,319
time is bigger

198
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,360
if it's bigger than the

199
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:15,199
next meeting start time

200
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,199
then we return fourth right return first

201
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,400
otherwise we return true right

202
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,720
yeah

203
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,440
so what are we doing here is that we try

204
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,199
to find the viral and overlap if we find

205
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,919
an overlap we return first otherwise

206
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,919
we'll return true right yes so this

207
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,440
thing this these

208
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,840
four lines

209
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:37,599
you can do using this o or function

210
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:39,840
remember we want to find out all return

211
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:42,800
return or oh what is mean means

212
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:45,039
everything needs to satisfy or

213
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,240
what m i

214
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:50,160
1 needs to be smaller or equal than

215
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,000
m i plus 1

216
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,960
0

217
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,800
for

218
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,319
i in

219
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,160
range

220
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,240
range n minus one okay so this is the

221
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:04,160
same thing look

222
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:06,720
the logic here if we find a violation we

223
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,840
return false at least one is what

224
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,879
means

225
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:13,440
all the conditions needs to be

226
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,199
true or right

227
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,639
yeah everything here needs to be true if

228
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,280
one of them

229
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,039
is fair it is false that is false okay

230
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,080
what's all that's all right

231
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,919
yeah

232
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,960
and we talk about any

233
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:30,720
right so what's any pretend

234
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:32,719
if i say any what does it mean

235
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,159
what does any mean

236
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,120
what's the difference between all and

237
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,279
any

238
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,360
any it could be one of them

239
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:42,399
has to be every single one exactly

240
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,680
that's perfect yeah so any if i say any

241
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,920
i put a not

242
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,000
is it the same thing or

243
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,320
can i write it the same english sentence

244
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,360
like honey it's the same thing yeah

245
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,240
all right

246
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,959
yeah

247
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,800
look all needs needs to be exactly that

248
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,600
everything needs to be true

249
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,959
not any so i have to

250
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,680
i have to

251
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,880
neglect the condition here i have to say

252
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,760
mi

253
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,360
if

254
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:11,760
one if it's bigger than m i plus one

255
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:15,279
zero for i this is the same okay so

256
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:18,399
basically this sign yeah look

257
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:20,880
okay smaller or equal if i use the not

258
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,000
any i have to make it bigger the

259
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,720
opposite

260
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,480
can can we uh understand this better so

261
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,760
for example if all your students in your

262
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:33,279
class needs to have a score

263
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,560
six at least six in this exam oh right

264
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:38,320
the opportunity

265
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:40,160
not any so it's the same thing as

266
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,440
any of the student in your class has the

267
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,440
score less than 60.

268
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,800
i put a knot you see the same thing

269
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,800
you see the same thing

270
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:53,360
yeah

271
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,080
yeah do you understand this

272
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,640
is the same thing i'm i'm asking that

273
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,440
everybody in your class

274
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,360
needs to attend the 60 or more

275
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,440
yeah in an exam

276
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,320
all i'm asking

277
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,680
not

278
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,600
any

279
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,760
of your

280
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,399
other students you know class has less

281
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:17,120
than 16. these two is the same thing

282
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,440
right but we neglect these

283
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,399
this line is different right but we put

284
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,040
a not

285
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,440
not any is equal to all right

286
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,440
yeah makes sense

287
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,320
so it's a little bit tricky here okay

288
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,680
but look we're using this fancy syntax

289
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,440
and if you

290
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,760
i mean if you want you can still use

291
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,800
this this is still good right so we are

292
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,720
trying to find out the violation and or

293
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,040
fighting of overlap if you find an

294
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,600
overlap that then we can not attend

295
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,959
these two meetings at the same time okay

296
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,720
and then the time complexity is

297
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,000
dominated by the solid because the

298
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,000
sorting is

299
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,600
uh you know it's all unlocked and this

300
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,959
one is linear

301
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,040
okay so can you tell me why the

302
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,320
complexity is not always knocking plus

303
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,720
and

304
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,519
oh and logan this is o and again

305
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:07,600
this is o n why don't we say okay the

306
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:10,399
time context is oh and then plus n okay

307
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,640
ryan do you have to understand this

308
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,959
why don't we say the time convex is our

309
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,079
knock and plus n because it sounds a bit

310
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:19,440
odd

311
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,440
it sounds a bit odd and

312
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,600
this is technically correct

313
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,839
but

314
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,560
that will be n plus

315
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:30,959
and

316
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,279
so this is technically clear but when we

317
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,760
talk about complexity we all usually we

318
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:38,800
always talk about uh what

319
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,959
the most dominating part because this is

320
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,200
bigger than that right compared to our

321
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,399
logan this is so small

322
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,480
yeah

323
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,040
all right so we don't talk about it it's

324
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,040
the same thing okay

325
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,600
yeah yeah

326
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:56,600
okay that will be for today bye-bye bye

327
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,600
bye
