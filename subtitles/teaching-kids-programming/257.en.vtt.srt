hello guys hello everyone
 

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,590
hello guys hello everyone
all right yeah so how do we add the

4
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:05,600
all right yeah so how do we add the
 

5
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,389
all right yeah so how do we add the
numbers

6
00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:06,399
numbers
 

7
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:08,470
numbers
how do you end the number like one two

8
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:08,480
how do you end the number like one two
 

9
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,830
how do you end the number like one two
three plus four

10
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:09,840
three plus four
 

11
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,549
three plus four
five how how do we add these two numbers

12
00:00:12,549 --> 00:00:12,559
five how how do we add these two numbers
 

13
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:23,509
five how how do we add these two numbers
how do you edit normally in mathematics

14
00:00:23,509 --> 00:00:23,519

 

15
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,509

so you start from the right to the left

16
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:25,519
so you start from the right to the left
 

17
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,509
so you start from the right to the left
yeah the left and the right

sorry you start from left to the right
 

21
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:30,790
sorry you start from left to the right
okay right here left

22
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:30,800
okay right here left
 

23
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,510
okay right here left
right to the left because i drank the

24
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:33,520
right to the left because i drank the
 

25
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,709
right to the left because i drank the
other that's one yeah

00:00:34,709 --> 00:00:34,719
other that's one yeah
 

27
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,069
other that's one yeah
that's one come on funny okay so you add

28
00:00:38,069 --> 00:00:38,079
that's one come on funny okay so you add
 

29
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,190
that's one come on funny okay so you add
these yeah yeah yeah eight and then you

30
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:41,200
these yeah yeah yeah eight and then you
 

31
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,229
these yeah yeah yeah eight and then you
come to that fifteen

32
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:44,239
come to that fifteen
 

33
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,549
come to that fifteen
no no no it's not 15. that's one okay so

34
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:46,559
no no no it's not 15. that's one okay so
 

35
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,549
no no no it's not 15. that's one okay so
five five eight and unless six

36
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:48,559
five five eight and unless six
 

37
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,150
five five eight and unless six
one yeah okay how about if i i have a

38
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:52,160
one yeah okay how about if i i have a
 

39
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,470
one yeah okay how about if i i have a
much bigger number here like nine so

40
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:54,480
much bigger number here like nine so
 

41
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,670
much bigger number here like nine so
what do you add this time

42
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:55,680
what do you add this time
 

43
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,029
what do you add this time
this little thing um if i was doing it

44
00:00:59,029 --> 00:00:59,039
this little thing um if i was doing it
 

45
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,389
this little thing um if i was doing it
um okay say

46
00:01:02,389 --> 00:01:02,399
um okay say
 

47
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,509
um okay say
equals 12 and then you get 12 12

48
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:05,519
equals 12 and then you get 12 12
 

49
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,310
equals 12 and then you get 12 12
and then you have a carry one right

50
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:08,320
and then you have a carry one right
 

51
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,910
and then you have a carry one right
because you put that one here right i

52
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:09,920
because you put that one here right i
 

53
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,590
because you put that one here right i
put the one at the bottom

54
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:11,600
put the one at the bottom
 

55
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,670
put the one at the bottom
okay it's the same okay at the bottom

56
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:13,680
okay it's the same okay at the bottom
 

57
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,870
okay it's the same okay at the bottom
okay and then

58
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:14,880
okay and then
 

59
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,550
okay and then
yeah i've never won a bottom of the line

60
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:18,560
yeah i've never won a bottom of the line
 

61
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,710
yeah i've never won a bottom of the line
so what here yeah no i think the one

62
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:22,720
so what here yeah no i think the one
 

63
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:47,670
so what here yeah no i think the one
lower than oh i don't know

64
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:47,680

 

65
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,950

okay okay good okay so uh

66
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:50,960
okay okay good okay so uh
 

67
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,310
okay okay good okay so uh
yeah so basically yeah it's the same

68
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:52,320
yeah so basically yeah it's the same
 

69
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,710
yeah so basically yeah it's the same
yeah so you got the

70
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:54,720
yeah so you got the
 

71
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,389
yeah so you got the
do it from the right which is once and

72
00:01:56,389 --> 00:01:56,399
do it from the right which is once and
 

73
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:57,830
do it from the right which is once and
then the tenth and then

74
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:57,840
then the tenth and then
 

75
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,910
then the tenth and then
a hundred yeah as long as we have at

76
00:01:59,910 --> 00:01:59,920
a hundred yeah as long as we have at
 

77
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,910
a hundred yeah as long as we have at
least one carry carry we keep doing

78
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:01,920
least one carry carry we keep doing
 

79
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,590
least one carry carry we keep doing
right right

80
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:03,600
right right
 

81
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,870
right right
okay so imperson yeah you know the price

82
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:06,880
okay so imperson yeah you know the price
 

83
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,589
okay so imperson yeah you know the price
and the the numbers can be arbitrary

84
00:02:09,589 --> 00:02:09,599
and the the numbers can be arbitrary
 

85
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,350
and the the numbers can be arbitrary
big so if that if this number you

86
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:13,360
big so if that if this number you
 

87
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,190
big so if that if this number you
if you want to add it if given two

88
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:15,200
if you want to add it if given two
 

89
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,630
if you want to add it if given two
string you know very very big

90
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:16,640
string you know very very big
 

91
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,630
string you know very very big
only implicitly in person this number

92
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:18,640
only implicitly in person this number
 

93
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,030
only implicitly in person this number
could be one two three you know

94
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:21,040
could be one two three you know
 

95
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,030
could be one two three you know
100 of them and then you add another

96
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,040
100 of them and then you add another
 

97
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,470
100 of them and then you add another
very very big number

98
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:24,480
very very big number
 

99
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,390
very very big number
you can just simply convert it the

100
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:26,400
you can just simply convert it the
 

101
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,270
you can just simply convert it the
string for example this is a this is b

102
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:29,280
string for example this is a this is b
 

103
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,550
string for example this is a this is b
you can just do this converted converted

104
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:32,560
you can just do this converted converted
 

105
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,830
you can just do this converted converted
string to the indeed

106
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:33,840
string to the indeed
 

107
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,110
string to the indeed
in in the a right plus

108
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:37,120
in in the a right plus
 

109
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,790
in in the a right plus
in b right and then you

110
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:40,800
in b right and then you
 

111
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,470
in b right and then you
after that you convert it back to the

112
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:42,480
after that you convert it back to the
 

113
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,790
after that you convert it back to the
string yeah return

114
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:44,800
string yeah return
 

115
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,910
string yeah return
okay okay so let's that only works in

116
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:47,920
okay okay so let's that only works in
 

117
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,630
okay okay so let's that only works in
person yeah you

118
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:48,640
person yeah you
 

119
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,470
person yeah you
first of

120
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:52,480

 

121
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,150

yeah yeah yeah because the computer does

122
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:54,160
yeah yeah yeah because the computer does
 

123
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,470
yeah yeah yeah because the computer does
the magic for you behind the scenes

124
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:56,480
the magic for you behind the scenes
 

125
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,149
the magic for you behind the scenes
so today we want to implement this

126
00:02:58,149 --> 00:02:58,159
so today we want to implement this
 

127
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,949
so today we want to implement this
without these we want to add a digi

128
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:00,959
without these we want to add a digi
 

129
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,350
without these we want to add a digi
number so you know how computer added

130
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:03,360
number so you know how computer added
 

131
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,350
number so you know how computer added
the digit by digit from the right to the

132
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:05,360
the digit by digit from the right to the
 

133
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,390
the digit by digit from the right to the
left yeah this is

134
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:06,400
left yeah this is
 

135
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,670
left yeah this is
general approach to to add the numbers

136
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:09,680
general approach to to add the numbers
 

137
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,030
general approach to to add the numbers
from the right to the left

138
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:11,040
from the right to the left
 

139
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,270
from the right to the left
okay while we're doing that

140
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:15,280
okay while we're doing that
 

141
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,430
okay while we're doing that
just to give you the idea how it

142
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:17,440
just to give you the idea how it
 

143
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,630
just to give you the idea how it
actually works

144
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:18,640
actually works
 

145
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,869
actually works
right so we need to understand how it

146
00:03:20,869 --> 00:03:20,879
right so we need to understand how it
 

147
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,550
right so we need to understand how it
works behind the scenes

148
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:22,560
works behind the scenes
 

149
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,229
works behind the scenes
i know how it works method

150
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:28,239

 

151
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,949

a b all right okay so first of all i

152
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:30,959
a b all right okay so first of all i
 

153
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:31,430
a b all right okay so first of all i
need to

154
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:31,440
need to
 

155
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,110
need to
know the length which is n one

156
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:35,120
know the length which is n one
 

157
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,630
know the length which is n one
n two equals length a

158
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:38,640
n two equals length a
 

159
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,710
n two equals length a
minus one okay let's because they start

160
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:40,720
minus one okay let's because they start
 

161
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,309
minus one okay let's because they start
from zero yeah

162
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:42,319
from zero yeah
 

163
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,430
from zero yeah
uh and then length p

164
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:45,440
uh and then length p
 

165
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,550
uh and then length p
minus one okay so what what does

166
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:48,560
minus one okay so what what does
 

167
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,470
minus one okay so what what does
so look if one two three plus 49

168
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:52,480
so look if one two three plus 49
 

169
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,589
so look if one two three plus 49
okay so n one is is two

170
00:03:55,589 --> 00:03:55,599
okay so n one is is two
 

171
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,830
okay so n one is is two
right this position we added from from

now i also have a carry actually means

198
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:34,639
now i also have a carry actually means

201
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,469
the one the one you put in at the bottom
here at the beginning you'll be

202
00:04:38,469 --> 00:04:38,479
here at the beginning you'll be
 

203
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,670
here at the beginning you'll be
equal to zero right there's no carry

204
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:41,680
equal to zero right there's no carry
 

205
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,150
equal to zero right there's no carry

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,909
this number these are yeah you haven't
we haven't we have we still have digits

for
 

255
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,350
for
a or we have we still have this

256
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:39,360
a or we have we still have this
 

257
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,070
a or we have we still have this
different

258
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,080
different
 

259
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,710
different
b or the carry is bigger than zero yeah

260
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:44,720
b or the carry is bigger than zero yeah
 

261
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,749
b or the carry is bigger than zero yeah
because if

262
00:05:45,749 --> 00:05:45,759
because if
 

263
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,430
because if
you look 99 plus one what

264
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:49,440
you look 99 plus one what
 

265
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,110
you look 99 plus one what
zero but we have a carry this

266
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:53,120
zero but we have a carry this
 

267
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,749
zero but we have a carry this
this is carry c okay y c is zero okay

268
00:05:57,749 --> 00:05:57,759
this is carry c okay y c is zero okay
 

269
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,550
this is carry c okay y c is zero okay
now i want to put it the number in x so

270
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:00,560
now i want to put it the number in x so
 

271
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:00,790
now i want to put it the number in x so
x

272
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:00,800
x
 

273
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,990
x
will be equals to carry first then if

274
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:04,000
will be equals to carry first then if
 

275
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,029
will be equals to carry first then if
n one bigger or equal than zero

276
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:07,039
n one bigger or equal than zero
 

277
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:11,430
n one bigger or equal than zero
then x plus equals a

278
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:11,440
then x plus equals a
 

279
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,790
then x plus equals a
and one right and i need to convert

280
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:14,800
and one right and i need to convert
 

281
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,909
and one right and i need to convert
this to integer right so i put x plus

282
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:17,919
this to integer right so i put x plus
 

283
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,790
this to integer right so i put x plus
equal integer converted the integer and

284
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:20,800
equal integer converted the integer and
 

285
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,309
equal integer converted the integer and
can you write the second one if

286
00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:22,319
can you write the second one if
 

287
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,350
can you write the second one if
n2 bigger or equal zero

288
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:25,360
n2 bigger or equal zero
 

289
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,390
n2 bigger or equal zero
whatever x

290
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:28,400
whatever x
 

291
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,880
whatever x
plus equal in

292
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:33,890

295
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,510

actually look i i if it's bigger than i

296
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:45,520
actually look i i if it's bigger than i
 

297
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,670
actually look i i if it's bigger than i
i use this number i actually have two

298
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:47,680
i use this number i actually have two
 

299
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,070
i use this number i actually have two
decremented yeah

300
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:50,080
decremented yeah
 

301
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,629
decremented yeah
and one minus equals one right so i use

302
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:52,639
and one minus equals one right so i use
 

303
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,309
and one minus equals one right so i use
the digit and then i need to go to the

304
00:06:54,309 --> 00:06:54,319
the digit and then i need to go to the
 

305
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,589
the digit and then i need to go to the
left right so here

306
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:55,599
left right so here
 

307
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,629
left right so here
again and two what

308
00:06:58,629 --> 00:06:58,639
again and two what
 

309
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,150
again and two what
minus equals one okay

310
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:02,160
minus equals one okay
 

311
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,510
minus equals one okay
okay now the x will be the sum okay

312
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:05,520
okay now the x will be the sum okay
 

313
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,029
okay now the x will be the sum okay
x will be what 3 plus 9 equals 12 right

314
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:09,039
x will be what 3 plus 9 equals 12 right
 

315
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,390
x will be what 3 plus 9 equals 12 right
so x will be 12 but i want to put a 2

316
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:12,400
so x will be 12 but i want to put a 2
 

317
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,510
so x will be 12 but i want to put a 2
right right so what

318
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:15,520
right right so what
 

319
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,550
right right so what
answer the append append left yeah

the the the thing is the how do you

358
00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:19,599
the the the thing is the how do you
 

359
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,189
the the the thing is the how do you
divide it by 10 and get that one

360

is the number
actually i need to convert it to a

412
00:09:41,829 --> 00:09:41,839
actually i need to convert it to a
 

413
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,269
actually i need to convert it to a
string because

414
00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:43,279
string because
 

415
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,389
string because
only string can join so star like that

416
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:46,399
only string can join so star like that
 

417
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:46,870
only string can join so star like that
you have to

418
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:46,880
you have to
 

419
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,949
you have to
convert this number to the string and

420
00:09:48,949 --> 00:09:48,959
convert this number to the string and
 

421
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,389
convert this number to the string and
then i can join

422
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:50,399
then i can join
 

423
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,150
then i can join

you want to convert this to the star

456
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:00,320
you want to convert this to the star
 

457
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,150
you want to convert this to the star
okay but let's find star stream

458
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:02,160
okay but let's find star stream
 

459
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,190
okay but let's find star stream
okay convert it to a string okay

460
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:05,200
okay convert it to a string okay
 

461
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,470
okay convert it to a string okay
next yeah okay okay okay and then
