1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,070

go hello

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:02,080
go hello
 

3
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,389
go hello
okay that's it hello mr eric all right

4
00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:06,399

 

5
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:08,070

what's magic

6
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:08,080
what's magic
 

7
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,470
what's magic
um

8
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:10,480

 

9
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,950

asthmatic what's magic

10
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:12,960
asthmatic what's magic
 

11
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:20,780
asthmatic what's magic
well it's this big little

12
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:20,790

 

13
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:29,029

[Music]

14
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:29,039

 

15
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,069

so yeah you can use the square bracket

16
00:00:32,069 --> 00:00:32,079
so yeah you can use the square bracket
 

17
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,229
so yeah you can use the square bracket
or you can just use mathematically just

18
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:34,239
or you can just use mathematically just
 

19
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,549
or you can just use mathematically just
to watch the bar and okay this is the

20
00:00:36,549 --> 00:00:36,559
to watch the bar and okay this is the
 

21
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,790
to watch the bar and okay this is the
same thing so this is two times two

22
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:38,800
same thing so this is two times two
 

23
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,470
same thing so this is two times two
matching what does it mean two rows two

24
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:40,480
matching what does it mean two rows two
 

25
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,830
matching what does it mean two rows two
columns yeah if this is

26
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:42,840
columns yeah if this is
 

27
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,990
columns yeah if this is
a uh a equals there how can we represent

28
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:46,000
a uh a equals there how can we represent
 

29
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,869
a uh a equals there how can we represent
it in python in computer

30
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:48,879
it in python in computer
 

31
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,470
it in python in computer
what do we what kind of data structure

32
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:50,480
what do we what kind of data structure
 

33
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,950
what do we what kind of data structure
can we use to store these kind of 2d

34
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:52,960
can we use to store these kind of 2d
 

35
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,029
can we use to store these kind of 2d
metrics the matching

36
00:00:57,029 --> 00:00:57,039

 

37
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,670

what's this in person next list

38
00:00:59,670 --> 00:00:59,680
what's this in person next list
 

39
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,590
what's this in person next list
at least it's the one dimensional so how

40
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:01,600
at least it's the one dimensional so how
 

41
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,310
at least it's the one dimensional so how
can we put a store list using

42
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:04,320
can we put a store list using
 

43
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,870
can we put a store list using
this in two minutes two dimensional

44
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:06,880
this in two minutes two dimensional
 

45
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,830
this in two minutes two dimensional
so

46
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:07,840
so
 

47
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,070
so
can you write a price and code a equals

48
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:10,080
can you write a price and code a equals
 

49
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,510
can you write a price and code a equals
one can you write

50
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:11,520
one can you write
 

51
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,990
one can you write
some stories

52
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:14,000
some stories
 

53
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,830
some stories
can you store these using the tyson list

54
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:17,840
can you store these using the tyson list
 

55
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,830
can you store these using the tyson list
a equals one

56
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:19,840
a equals one
 

57
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,109
a equals one
what

58
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:21,119
what
 

59
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,749
what
look here at least so what's this

60
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:23,759
look here at least so what's this
 

61
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,990
look here at least so what's this
it's same as a list of two lists right

62
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:28,000
it's same as a list of two lists right
 

63
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,990
it's same as a list of two lists right
yeah so okay

64
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:30,000
yeah so okay
 

65
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,510
yeah so okay
so a list of

66
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:31,520
so a list of
 

67
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,469
so a list of
at least one two and comma

68
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:34,479
at least one two and comma
 

69
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:35,830
at least one two and comma
three four

70
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:35,840
three four
 

71
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,990
three four
right this is how you store it in person

72
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:38,000
right this is how you store it in person
 

73
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,230
right this is how you store it in person
so what does it mean this is the list

74
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:40,240
so what does it mean this is the list
 

75
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,950
so what does it mean this is the list
contains two sublist the first place is

76
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:42,960
contains two sublist the first place is
 

77
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,950
contains two sublist the first place is
the first row the second is is the

78
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:44,960
the first row the second is is the
 

79
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,550
the first row the second is is the
second row okay

80
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:46,560
second row okay
 

81
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,429
second row okay
yeah

82
00:01:47,429 --> 00:01:47,439
yeah
 

83
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,590
yeah
so how can i get the

84
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:49,600
so how can i get the
 

85
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,550
so how can i get the
row number of rows

86
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:52,560
row number of rows
 

87
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,429
row number of rows
of a how to get the number of rows of a

88
00:01:57,429 --> 00:01:57,439
of a how to get the number of rows of a
 

89
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,789
of a how to get the number of rows of a
length a

90
00:01:58,789 --> 00:01:58,799
length a
 

91
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,190
length a
weather and how can i can we get the

92
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:01,200
weather and how can i can we get the
 

93
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,910
weather and how can i can we get the
current number of currents in a

94
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:03,920
current number of currents in a
 

95
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,230
current number of currents in a
a

96
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:06,240
a
 

97
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,550
a
well done very well done okay very well

98
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:08,560
well done very well done okay very well
 

99
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,070
well done very well done okay very well
done okay

100
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:10,080
done okay
 

101
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,430
done okay
okay so in mathematics mathematics uh we

102
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:13,440
okay so in mathematics mathematics uh we
 

103
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,270
okay so in mathematics mathematics uh we
can add two matrix a plus b if or a

104
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:17,280
can add two matrix a plus b if or a
 

105
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,589
can add two matrix a plus b if or a
minus b if it's the same size is the

106
00:02:19,589 --> 00:02:19,599
minus b if it's the same size is the
 

107
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,910
minus b if it's the same size is the
same size same dimension which means the

108
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:21,920
same size same dimension which means the
 

109
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,630
same size same dimension which means the
postmates have said number row some

110
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:24,640
postmates have said number row some
 

111
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,990
postmates have said number row some
number of columns

112
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:26,000
number of columns
 

113
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,830
number of columns
so if i have a metric like one two three

114
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:29,840
so if i have a metric like one two three
 

115
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,790
so if i have a metric like one two three
four

116
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:30,800
four
 

117
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,229
four
if i add another metric three four two

118
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:34,239
if i add another metric three four two
 

119
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,229
if i add another metric three four two
one can you imagine what can we get

120
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:38,239
one can you imagine what can we get
 

121
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,710
one can you imagine what can we get
can you imagine how how do you solve

122
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:40,720
can you imagine how how do you solve
 

123
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,509
can you imagine how how do you solve
this problem um you just add these two

124
00:02:43,509 --> 00:02:43,519
this problem um you just add these two
 

125
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,309
this problem um you just add these two
same relationship okay so one plus three

126
00:02:46,309 --> 00:02:46,319
same relationship okay so one plus three
 

127
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,830
same relationship okay so one plus three
equals four and then what's

128
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:48,840
equals four and then what's
 

129
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,990
equals four and then what's
next um six yeah sun position

130
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,000
next um six yeah sun position
 

131
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,070
next um six yeah sun position
and then same position five

132
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:54,080
and then same position five
 

133
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,350
and then same position five
third position five and how about like

134
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:57,360
third position five and how about like
 

135
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,070
third position five and how about like
one two three four

136
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,080
one two three four
 

137
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,670
one two three four
minus

138
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:01,680
minus
 

139
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,869
minus
three four two one okay can you imagine

140
00:03:04,869 --> 00:03:04,879
three four two one okay can you imagine
 

141
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,589
three four two one okay can you imagine
what happened yeah um it's minus two

142
00:03:07,589 --> 00:03:07,599
what happened yeah um it's minus two
 

143
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,470
what happened yeah um it's minus two
minus two um

144
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:10,480
minus two um
 

145
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,670
minus two um
minus two

146
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:13,680

 

147
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,270

one

148
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:15,280
one
 

149
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,030
one
three okay okay so yeah let's add

150
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,040
three okay okay so yeah let's add
 

151
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,589
three okay okay so yeah let's add
addition and subtraction is very easy we

152
00:03:21,589 --> 00:03:21,599
addition and subtraction is very easy we
 

153
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,190
addition and subtraction is very easy we
just do this perform these operations on

154
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:25,200
just do this perform these operations on
 

155
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,710
just do this perform these operations on
the element at both matrix

156
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:28,720
the element at both matrix
 

157
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,229
the element at both matrix
then the same the same as the same

158
00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:30,239
then the same the same as the same
 

159
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,869
then the same the same as the same
position okay right now we put it in the

160
00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:32,879
position okay right now we put it in the
 

161
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,149
position okay right now we put it in the
same yeah

162
00:03:34,149 --> 00:03:34,159
same yeah
 

163
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,030
same yeah
put it in a result yeah

164
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,040
put it in a result yeah
 

165
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,229
put it in a result yeah
okay so let's implement this okay uh if

166
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:40,239
okay so let's implement this okay uh if
 

167
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:41,990
okay so let's implement this okay uh if
if there are some different size we

168
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:42,000
if there are some different size we
 

169
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,949
if there are some different size we
cannot add yeah we prefer the

170
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:44,959

171
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,190
cannot add yeah we prefer the

172
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:47,200
to throw at the exception and if their
 

173
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:53,830
to throw at the exception and if their
size are different right okay

174
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:53,840

okay let's do this rose a rose a

182
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:04,640
okay let's do this rose a rose a
 

183
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,429
okay let's do this rose a rose a
equals lens a yeah you know that right

184
00:04:07,429 --> 00:04:07,439
equals lens a yeah you know that right
 

185
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,789
equals lens a yeah you know that right
right now we need to assert what's

186
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:08,799
right now we need to assert what's
 

187
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,470
right now we need to assert what's
assuming

188
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:10,480
assuming
 

189
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,630
assuming
to check you have to take computer lab

190
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:12,640
to check you have to take computer lab
 

191
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,789
to check you have to take computer lab
okay i'm assuming

192
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:14,799
okay i'm assuming
 

193
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,670
okay i'm assuming
r is strictly bigger than zero okay yeah

194
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:17,680
r is strictly bigger than zero okay yeah
 

195
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,590
r is strictly bigger than zero okay yeah
if we found out i is zero or whatever

196
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:19,600
if we found out i is zero or whatever
 

197
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,270
if we found out i is zero or whatever
the capital is green

198
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:21,280
the capital is green
 

199
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,430
the capital is green
okay it was refused to continue that's

200
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:23,440
okay it was refused to continue that's
 

201
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,230
okay it was refused to continue that's
what it means yeah and c equals length

202
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:26,240
what it means yeah and c equals length
 

203
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,390
what it means yeah and c equals length
what

204
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:30,400

 

205
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,390

this is the column and now i need to

206
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:32,400
this is the column and now i need to
 

207
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,909
this is the column and now i need to
check that

208
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:33,919
check that
 

209
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,950
check that
the rows and columns are the same as the

210
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:36,960
the rows and columns are the same as the
 

211
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,950
the rows and columns are the same as the
size of b yeah so result i equals one

212
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:40,960
size of b yeah so result i equals one
 

213
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,710
size of b yeah so result i equals one
i equals one

214
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:42,720
i equals one
 

215
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,030
i equals one
what's the number of rows in b

216
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:45,040
what's the number of rows in b
 

217
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,590
what's the number of rows in b
what's the number rows in b

218
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:47,600
what's the number rows in b
 

219
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,550
what's the number rows in b
length b

220
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:48,560
length b
 

221
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,230
length b
and

222
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:50,240
and
 

223
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,510
and
the columns need to be same this column

224
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:53,520
the columns need to be same this column
 

225
00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:00,390
the columns need to be same this column
length

226
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:00,400

 

227
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,110

okay so this is just to check to prepare

228
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:03,120
okay so this is just to check to prepare
 

229
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,350
okay so this is just to check to prepare
let's okay we have the two metric which

230
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:05,360
let's okay we have the two metric which
 

231
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,350
let's okay we have the two metric which
has the same size and then b and we want

232
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:07,360
has the same size and then b and we want
 

233
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,749
has the same size and then b and we want
to add it together so there's no there's

234
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:09,759
to add it together so there's no there's
 

235
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,390
to add it together so there's no there's
a one way to do it is to allocate the

236
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:12,400
a one way to do it is to allocate the
 

237
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,590
a one way to do it is to allocate the
metric of

238
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:13,600
metric of
 

239
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,590
metric of
a separate metric right

240
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:15,600
a separate metric right
 

241
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,550
a separate metric right
yeah

242
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:16,560
yeah
 

243
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,150
yeah
and all we can just add it to a right

244
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:20,160
and all we can just add it to a right
 

245
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,790
and all we can just add it to a right
yes we get it so let's do this one by

246
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:22,800
yes we get it so let's do this one by
 

247
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,590
yes we get it so let's do this one by
one okay what's how can we add it to a

248
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:25,600
one okay what's how can we add it to a
 

249
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,390
one okay what's how can we add it to a
for

250

can you imagine what's the operator here

272
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:44,400
can you imagine what's the operator here
 

273
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,749
can you imagine what's the operator here
and then corresponding one will be b

274

and then corresponding one will be b
 

275
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,110
and then corresponding one will be b
what what

276
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:49,120
what what
 

277
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,230
what what
yeah

278
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:50,240
yeah
 

279
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,310
yeah
i go through each rows i turn through

280
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:52,320
i go through each rows i turn through
 

281
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,749
i go through each rows i turn through
these columns

282
00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:53,759
these columns
 

283
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:54,950
these columns
i see

284
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:54,960
i see
 

285
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,270
i see
what's this i want to

286
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:57,280
what's this i want to
 

287
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,029
what's this i want to
add these to a

288
00:05:59,029 --> 00:05:59,039
add these to a
 

289
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,629
add these to a
so

290
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:00,639
so
 

291
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,710
so
class

class
 

293
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,390
class
and what should i put here

294
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:04,400
and what should i put here
 

295
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:11,990
and what should i put here
um

296
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:12,000

 

297
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,110

yeah you know

00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:13,120
yeah you know
 

299
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,230
yeah you know
what's the time complexity

300
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:16,240
what's the time complexity
 

301
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:30,120
what's the time complexity
what's the time investing

302
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,130

[Music]
 

305
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,950
[Music]
are we using any space

306
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:34,960
are we using any space
 

307
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,390
are we using any space
we're changing the space so we're not

308
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:36,400
we're changing the space so we're not
 

309
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,430
we're changing the space so we're not
using in this place yeah oh

310
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:39,440
using in this place yeah oh
 

311
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,670
using in this place yeah oh
we are not using any space oh one come

312
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:41,680
we are not using any space oh one come
 

313
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,390
we are not using any space oh one come
on

314
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:42,400
on
 

315
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,309
on
okay so uh

316
00:06:44,309 --> 00:06:44,319
okay so uh
 

317
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,270
okay so uh
no if this is subset so if this

318
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:47,280
no if this is subset so if this
 

319
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,749
no if this is subset so if this
substrate there's only one character we

320
00:06:49,749 --> 00:06:49,759
substrate there's only one character we
 

321
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,469
substrate there's only one character we
need to change

322
00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:52,479

 

323
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,870

if this is substrate i want to structure

324
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:54,880
if this is substrate i want to structure
 

325
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,270
if this is substrate i want to structure
a to b from subject b

326
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:57,280
a to b from subject b
 

327
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,110
a to b from subject b
a from uh

328
00:06:59,110 --> 00:06:59,120
a from uh
 

329
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,710
a from uh
such a b for a so i change this to a

330
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:02,720
such a b for a so i change this to a
 

331
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,510
such a b for a so i change this to a
minus yeah got it yes same complexity oh

332
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:05,520
minus yeah got it yes same complexity oh
 

333
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,110
minus yeah got it yes same complexity oh
i see because we need to go through each

334
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:07,120
i see because we need to go through each
 

335
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,589
i see because we need to go through each
element in the uh elementary and we

336
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:09,599
element in the uh elementary and we
 

337
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,430
element in the uh elementary and we
change that okay so

338
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:11,440
change that okay so
 

339
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,909
change that okay so
you get here so now we talk about how to

340
00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:13,919
you get here so now we talk about how to
 

341
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,830
you get here so now we talk about how to
educate one yeah sometimes you you're

342
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:15,840
educate one yeah sometimes you you're
 

343
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,309
educate one yeah sometimes you you're
not allowed to change the metric yeah

344
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:18,319
not allowed to change the metric yeah
 

345
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,029
not allowed to change the metric yeah
because you are changing the metric here

346
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:21,039
because you are changing the metric here
 

347
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,270
because you are changing the metric here
so we if we we can allocate the metric

348
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:23,280
so we if we we can allocate the metric
 

349
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,110
so we if we we can allocate the metric
how can we allocate magic

350
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:25,120
how can we allocate magic
 

351
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,830
how can we allocate magic
c equals the same size we add at the

352
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:27,840
c equals the same size we add at the
 

353
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,270
c equals the same size we add at the
beginning

354
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:29,280
beginning
 

355
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,790
beginning
what zero

356
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:30,800
what zero
 

357
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,710
what zero
we put it there for

358
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:32,720
we put it there for
 

359
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,830
we put it there for
underscore in range how many columns of

360
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:35,840
underscore in range how many columns of
 

361

00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:36,560
how
 

363
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,710
how
this is how many columns first of all

364
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:38,720
this is how many columns first of all

columns c yeah yeah
 

373
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,430
columns c yeah yeah
and now we do this yeah this is the

374
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:49,440
and now we do this yeah this is the
 

375
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,830
and now we do this yeah this is the

376
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:51,840
color this is the
 

377
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,270
color this is the
each row has the c columns and then four

378
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:55,280
each row has the c columns and then four
 

379
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,270

[Music]

390
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:04,960
[Music]
 

391
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,950
[Music]
are yeah okay so if this is the way to

392
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:06,960
are yeah okay so if this is the way to
 

393
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,029
are yeah okay so if this is the way to
allocate at least the list

394
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:09,039
allocate at least the list
 

395
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,749
allocate at least the list
with r columns arrows and sequence and

396
00:08:11,749 --> 00:08:11,759
with r columns arrows and sequence and
 

397
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,909
with r columns arrows and sequence and
then you once you allocate it you just

398
00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:13,919
then you once you allocate it you just
 

399
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,830
then you once you allocate it you just
do this you have crc

400
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:15,840
do this you have crc
 

401
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,390
do this you have crc
equals you can just do it equals a rc

402
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:20,400
equals you can just do it equals a rc
 

403
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,629
equals you can just do it equals a rc
and then minus brco plus a over c that's

404
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:22,639
and then minus brco plus a over c that's
 

405
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:23,589
and then minus brco plus a over c that's
got it

406
00:08:23,589 --> 00:08:23,599
got it
 

407
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,350
got it
and if you implement this what's the

408
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:25,360
and if you implement this what's the
 

409
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:33,350
and if you implement this what's the
time complexity

410
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:33,360

 

411
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:41,269

what's a space for music

412
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:41,279

 

413
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,350

yeah we are educating this space okay

414
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:43,360
yeah we are educating this space okay
 

415
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,269
yeah we are educating this space okay
got it yeah it's not easy it's not hard

416
00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:45,279
got it yeah it's not easy it's not hard
 

417
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,710
got it yeah it's not easy it's not hard
yeah

418
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:46,720
yeah
 

419
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,670
yeah
okay

420
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:47,680
okay
 

421
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,750
okay
so this is the magic

422
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:49,760
so this is the magic
 

423
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,630
so this is the magic
plus and uh subject uh add and subtract

424
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:52,640
plus and uh subject uh add and subtract
 

425
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,030
plus and uh subject uh add and subtract
okay so let's talk about uh

426
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:57,040
okay so let's talk about uh
 

427
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,190
okay so let's talk about uh
multiplied

428
00:08:59,190 --> 00:08:59,200
multiplied
 

429
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,790
multiplied
okay what's multiplier a times b

430
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:02,800
okay what's multiplier a times b
 

431
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,070
okay what's multiplier a times b
let's check this

432
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:04,080
let's check this
 

433
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,590
let's check this
yes

434
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:05,600
yes
 

435
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,110
yes
okay so a times b okay so

436
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:09,120
okay so a times b okay so
 

437
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,430
okay so a times b okay so
the matrix only has

438
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:11,440
the matrix only has
 

439
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,750
the matrix only has
plus

440
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:13,760
plus
 

441
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,509
plus
subtract

442
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:15,519
subtract
 

443
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,990
subtract
and multiply there's no division okay

444
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:18,000
and multiply there's no division okay
 

445
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,110
and multiply there's no division okay
there's no division but

446
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:21,120
there's no division but
 

447
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,430
there's no division but
you can approximate

448
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:23,440
you can approximate
 

449
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,910
you can approximate
we can define the uh division by using

450
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:25,920
we can define the uh division by using
 

451
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,509
we can define the uh division by using
some uh

452
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:27,519
some uh
 

453
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,110
some uh
the inverse of matrix which you'll talk

454
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:29,120
the inverse of matrix which you'll talk
 

455
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,949
the inverse of matrix which you'll talk
about later so let's skip the division

456
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:30,959
about later so let's skip the division
 

457
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,350
about later so let's skip the division
for now okay a times b what's matching

458
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:33,360
for now okay a times b what's matching
 

459
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,949
for now okay a times b what's matching
battery multiplication is different

460
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:36,959
battery multiplication is different
 

461
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,470
battery multiplication is different
it's different okay

462
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:38,480
it's different okay
 

463
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,269
it's different okay
so

464
00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:39,279
so
 

465
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,230
so
look

466
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:40,240
look
 

467
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,310
look
i show you okay

468
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:42,320
i show you okay
 

469
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,190
i show you okay
one two three four

470
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:45,200
one two three four
 

471
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,910
one two three four
times

472
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:47,920

 

473
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,269

one

474

one zero zero
equals one

478
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:55,200
equals one
 

479
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,389
equals one
it's hard yeah so look i did it no no no

480
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:58,399
it's hard yeah so look i did it no no no
 

481
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,990
it's hard yeah so look i did it no no no
no no

482
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:00,000
no no
 

483

look
 

485
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,710
look
you take

486
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:02,720
you take
 

487
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,110
you take
you take the rows for for the first one

488
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:05,120
you take the rows for for the first one
 

489
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,230
you take the rows for for the first one
yeah and you take the columns for for

490
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:08,240
yeah and you take the columns for for
 

491
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,750
yeah and you take the columns for for
for the second one

492
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:09,760
for the second one
 

493
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,310
for the second one
you do the top plata remember what stop

494
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:14,320

 

495
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,990

we talked about that the day uh

496
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,000
we talked about that the day uh
 

497
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,990
we talked about that the day uh
yesterday

498
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:18,000
yesterday
 

499
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,190
yesterday
yeah

500
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:19,200
yeah
 

501
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,590
yeah
don't put that one two

502
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:21,600
don't put that one two
 

503
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,590
don't put that one two
and then look one two and one zero

504
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:25,600
and then look one two and one zero
 

505
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,710
and then look one two and one zero
what's the top product

506
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:28,720

 

507
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,630

do you still remember what's the double

508
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:30,640
do you still remember what's the double
 

509
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,750
do you still remember what's the double
dot

510
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:31,760
dot
 

511
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,389
dot
these two plus b2

512
00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:34,399
these two plus b2
 

513
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,030
these two plus b2
what's the product

514
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:37,040
what's the product
 

515
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,990
what's the product
a and b dot product equals one

516
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:40,000
a and b dot product equals one
 

517
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,350
a and b dot product equals one
sum of i equals zero to n minus one a i

518
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:45,360
sum of i equals zero to n minus one a i
 

519
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,069
sum of i equals zero to n minus one a i
times bi right remember

520
00:10:48,069 --> 00:10:48,079
times bi right remember
 

521
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,350
times bi right remember
yeah

522
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:49,360
yeah
 

523
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,110
yeah
so

524
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:51,120
so
 

525
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,389
so
one times one plus two times two times

526
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:54,399
one times one plus two times two times
 

527
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,829
one times one plus two times two times
zero

528
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:55,839
zero
 

529
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,030
zero
okay

530
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,040
okay
 

531
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,829
okay
what's this

532
00:10:58,829 --> 00:10:58,839
what's this
 

533
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:02,470
what's this
one one yeah i think it's one times two

534
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:02,480
one one yeah i think it's one times two
 

535
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,670
one one yeah i think it's one times two
oh yeah

536
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:03,680

okay
and again next one yeah next one here

558
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:25,440
and again next one yeah next one here
 

559
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,750
and again next one yeah next one here
you take this at least

560
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:29,760

 

561
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,590

one no no no you just look at it you

562
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:31,600
one no no no you just look at it you
 

563
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,509
one no no no you just look at it you
take this first row

564
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:33,519
take this first row
 

565
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,670
take this first row
second column first row second column

566
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:35,680
second column first row second column
 

567
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,670
second column first row second column
first the second column so you'll be

568
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:37,680
first the second column so you'll be
 

569
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,430
first the second column so you'll be
one two

570
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:39,440
one two
 

571
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,069
one two
top quarter and one zero one what what's

572
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:42,079
top quarter and one zero one what what's
 

573
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,590
top quarter and one zero one what what's
this one times zero plus two times one

574
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:45,600
this one times zero plus two times one
 

575
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,150
this one times zero plus two times one
equals one

576
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:48,160
equals one
 

577
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,590
equals one
two two

578
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:49,600
two two
 

579
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,350
two two
okay so the same the second one three

580
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:51,360
okay so the same the second one three
 

581
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,310
okay so the same the second one three
four one zero

582
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:54,320
four one zero
 

583
00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:03,990
four one zero
three four one

584
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:04,000

 

585
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,150

zero one three times zero zero four

586
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:06,160
zero one three times zero zero four
 

587
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,389
zero one three times zero zero four
times one four

588
00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:08,399
times one four
 

589
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,710
times one four
you see yeah that's exactly the same

590
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:10,720
you see yeah that's exactly the same
 

591
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,509
you see yeah that's exactly the same
thing good job look at this

592
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:13,519
thing good job look at this
 

593
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,110
thing good job look at this
what's that mean

594
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:15,120
what's that mean
 

595
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,670
what's that mean
you remember you have a metric if it's a

596
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:17,680
you remember you have a metric if it's a
 

597
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,829
you remember you have a metric if it's a
square metric with the diagonal only

598
00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:19,839
square metric with the diagonal only
 

599
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,829
square metric with the diagonal only
fear one right

600
00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:21,839
fear one right
 

601
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:22,790
fear one right
yeah

602
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:22,800
yeah
 

603
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,990
yeah
all

604
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:24,000
all
 

605
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,710
all
we call it identity magic

606
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:26,720
we call it identity magic
 

607
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,350
we call it identity magic
okay so this is identity

608
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:29,360
okay so this is identity
 

609
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,829
okay so this is identity
and this is also identical

610
00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:31,839
and this is also identical
 

611
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,949
and this is also identical
one one one zero zero zero zero zero

612
00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:34,959
one one one zero zero zero zero zero
 

613
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,870
one one one zero zero zero zero zero
zero can you write the four times four

614
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:36,880
zero can you write the four times four
 

615
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,750
zero can you write the four times four
for identity magic

616
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:39,760
for identity magic
 

617
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,190
for identity magic
four times for identity magic line line

618
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:43,200
four times for identity magic line line
 

619
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,150
four times for identity magic line line
yeah

620
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:44,160
yeah
 

621
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,990
yeah
one one

622
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:46,000
one one
 

623
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,269
one one
one

624
00:12:47,269 --> 00:12:47,279
one
 

625
00:12:47,279 --> 00:13:01,030
one
and all honest you know okay okay

626
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,040

 

627
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,910

so i think this metric we will use the

628
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:03,920
so i think this metric we will use the
 

629
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,110
so i think this metric we will use the
use the

630
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:05,120
use the
 

631
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,829
use the
i to normally represent as identity

632
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:07,839
i to normally represent as identity
 

633
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,350
i to normally represent as identity
measure okay

634
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:09,360
measure okay
 

635
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,389
measure okay
look in order for the multiplication to

636
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:12,399
look in order for the multiplication to
 

637
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,509
look in order for the multiplication to
happen look the number of the columns

638
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:15,519
happen look the number of the columns
 

639
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:16,550
happen look the number of the columns
yeah

640
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:16,560
yeah
 

641
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,509
yeah
means the number of columns a

642
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:19,519
means the number of columns a
 

643
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,710
means the number of columns a
the number of columns of a

644
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:22,720
the number of columns of a
 

645
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,190
the number of columns of a
columns of a let's say c a

646
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:27,200
columns of a let's say c a
 

647
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,069
columns of a let's say c a
needs to equal as one

648
00:13:30,069 --> 00:13:30,079
needs to equal as one
 

649
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:37,670
needs to equal as one
c a and needs to equal what

650
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:37,680

 

651
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,150

yeah the number of columns

652
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:40,160
yeah the number of columns
 

653
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,829
yeah the number of columns
needs to equals to the the number of

654
00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:41,839
needs to equals to the the number of
 

655
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,750
needs to equals to the the number of
columns of a needs to equal the number

656
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:43,760
columns of a needs to equal the number
 

657
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,189
columns of a needs to equal the number
of columns of b right

658
00:13:45,189 --> 00:13:45,199
of columns of b right
 

659
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,870
of columns of b right
right if it doesn't equal there is no

660
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:46,880
right if it doesn't equal there is no
 

661
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,550
right if it doesn't equal there is no
copper that you cannot multiply okay

662
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:48,560
copper that you cannot multiply okay
 

663
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,509
copper that you cannot multiply okay
okay

664
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:49,519
okay
 

665
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,509
okay
and what's the result

666
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:51,519
and what's the result
 

667
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:52,790
and what's the result
look if

668
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:52,800
look if
 

669
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,790
look if
if look look if this is one two three

670
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:56,800
if look look if this is one two three
 

671
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,790
if look look if this is one two three
four five six

672
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:58,800
four five six
 

673
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,150
four five six
right you can times one one zero zero

674
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:02,160
right you can times one one zero zero
 

675
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,629
right you can times one one zero zero
and that will return one

676
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:04,639
and that will return one
 

677
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,230
and that will return one
that will determine three four you will

678
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:06,240
that will determine three four you will
 

679
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,470
that will determine three four you will
do the same yeah as i say yeah right

680
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:08,480
do the same yeah as i say yeah right
 

681
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,269
do the same yeah as i say yeah right
look

682
00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:09,279
look
 

683
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,430
look
you can do this yeah one two one zero

684
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:11,440
you can do this yeah one two one zero
 

685
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,509
you can do this yeah one two one zero
that's one one two zero one is two three

686
00:14:15,509 --> 00:14:15,519
that's one one two zero one is two three
 

687
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,990
that's one one two zero one is two three
four one zero is three three four zero

688
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:18,000
four one zero is three three four zero
 

689
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,269
four one zero is three three four zero
one is four yeah five six one zero is

690
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:21,279
one is four yeah five six one zero is
 

691
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:24,150
one is four yeah five six one zero is
five five six zero one is six

692
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:24,160
five five six zero one is six
 

693
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,110
five five six zero one is six
so look

694
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:25,120
so look
 

695
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,110
so look
this is a metric of what

696
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:27,120
this is a metric of what
 

697
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,990
this is a metric of what
three row times two column right look

698
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:30,000
three row times two column right look
 

699
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,710
three row times two column right look
here and this is um identity metric of

700
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:32,720
here and this is um identity metric of
 

701
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,150
here and this is um identity metric of
two times two

702
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:34,160
two times two
 

703
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,470
two times two
this needs to be the same right this

704
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:36,480
this needs to be the same right this
 

705
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,189
this needs to be the same right this
needs to be equal all right got it

706
00:14:39,189 --> 00:14:39,199
needs to be equal all right got it
 

707
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,750
needs to be equal all right got it
yeah

708
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:41,760

 

709
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,750

yeah yeah so what's the answer what's

710
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:43,760
yeah yeah so what's the answer what's
 

711
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,269
yeah yeah so what's the answer what's
the dimension of the answer

712
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:47,279

 

713
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,189

yeah i know but what's the dimensional

714
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:49,199
yeah i know but what's the dimensional
 

715
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,790
yeah i know but what's the dimensional
answer is 3 times 2 right you see

716
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:50,800
answer is 3 times 2 right you see
 

717
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,710
answer is 3 times 2 right you see
because these two are the same

718
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:52,720
because these two are the same
 

719
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,030
because these two are the same
and the answer will be three rows two

720
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:55,040
and the answer will be three rows two
 

721
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,550
and the answer will be three rows two
columns

722
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:56,560
columns
 

723
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,670
columns
okay

724
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:57,680
okay
 

725
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,750
okay
yeah

726
00:14:59,750 --> 00:14:59,760
yeah
 

727
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,269
yeah
does it make sense look

728
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:01,279
does it make sense look
 

729
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,790
does it make sense look
a times b if a the metric is

730
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:04,800
a times b if a the metric is
 

731
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,069
a times b if a the metric is
ah

732
00:15:06,069 --> 00:15:06,079
ah
 

733
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,150
ah
is okay let's do this

734
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:08,160
is okay let's do this
 

735
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,110
is okay let's do this
a

736
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:09,120
a
 

737
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,509
a
a columns and b

738
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:11,519
a columns and b
 

739
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,030
a columns and b
a columns and b

740
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:13,040
a columns and b
 

741
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,670
a columns and b
a rows and b columns and then b

742
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:15,680
a rows and b columns and then b
 

743
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,189
a rows and b columns and then b
is b rows and c columns so what's the

744
00:15:19,189 --> 00:15:19,199
is b rows and c columns so what's the
 

745
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,590
is b rows and c columns so what's the
what's the dimension of the result c can

746
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:21,600
what's the dimension of the result c can
 

747
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,710
what's the dimension of the result c can
you tell me

748
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:22,720
you tell me
 

749
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,389
you tell me
come on

750
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:24,399
come on
 

751
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,069
come on
okay a magic is a rule of b columns b

752
00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:28,079
okay a magic is a rule of b columns b
 

753
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,670
okay a magic is a rule of b columns b
matrix is b

754
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:29,680
matrix is b
 

755
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,110
matrix is b
rho c columns a times c yeah where that

756
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:33,120
rho c columns a times c yeah where that
 

757
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,790
rho c columns a times c yeah where that
a times c that's what i'm talking about

758
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:34,800
a times c that's what i'm talking about
 

759
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,110
a times c that's what i'm talking about
yeah okay

760
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:37,120
yeah okay
 

761
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,670
yeah okay
so any magic times the b identity magic

762
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:41,680
so any magic times the b identity magic
 

763
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,189
so any magic times the b identity magic
is uh

764
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:43,199
is uh
 

765
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,629
is uh
itself right

766
00:15:44,629 --> 00:15:44,639
itself right
 

767
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,710
itself right
so can you tell me a times b

768
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:46,720
so can you tell me a times b
 

769
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,389
so can you tell me a times b
is it the same as b times a

770
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:50,399
is it the same as b times a
 

771
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,900
is it the same as b times a
equal or equal to

772
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:52,910
equal or equal to
 

773
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:57,350
equal or equal to
[Music]

774
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:57,360

 

775
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,870

you can plus the number one plus two

776
00:15:58,870 --> 00:15:58,880
you can plus the number one plus two
 

777
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,670
you can plus the number one plus two
equals two plus one right yeah one times

778
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:01,680
equals two plus one right yeah one times
 

779
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,230
equals two plus one right yeah one times
two equals two times one the numbers are

780
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:04,240
two equals two times one the numbers are
 

781
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,670
two equals two times one the numbers are
okay yeah exchange

782
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:05,680
okay yeah exchange
 

783
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,629
okay yeah exchange
but magic is not a times b magic is not

784
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:08,639
but magic is not a times b magic is not
 

785
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,949
but magic is not a times b magic is not
the same as b times a okay

786
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:10,959
the same as b times a okay
 

787
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,269
the same as b times a okay
yeah because sometimes look if you one

788
00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:13,279
yeah because sometimes look if you one
 

789
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,269
yeah because sometimes look if you one
times three and then you want to times

790
00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:15,279
times three and then you want to times
 

791
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,590
times three and then you want to times
three times uh times five you can times

792
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:17,600
three times uh times five you can times
 

793
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,590
three times uh times five you can times
the i the result will be one times five

794
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:19,600
the i the result will be one times five
 

795
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,550
the i the result will be one times five
but if you reverse it what happened what

796
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:22,560
but if you reverse it what happened what
 

797
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,470
but if you reverse it what happened what
happened 3 times 5

798
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:24,480
happened 3 times 5
 

799
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,749
happened 3 times 5
times 3

800
00:16:25,749 --> 00:16:25,759
times 3
 

801
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,310
times 3
times 1 right you can't multiply right

802
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:28,320
times 1 right you can't multiply right
 

803
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,389
times 1 right you can't multiply right
because this is this

804
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:30,399
because this is this
 

805
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,069
because this is this
not the same side right

806
00:16:32,069 --> 00:16:32,079
not the same side right
 

807
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:36,590
not the same side right
why you cannot multiply right

808
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:36,600

853
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,750
a and b
okay so the the

854
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:27,760
okay so the the
 

855
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,029
okay so the the
first field

856
00:17:29,029 --> 00:17:29,039
first field
 

857
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,110
first field
the first few are similar right so we

858
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:31,120
the first few are similar right so we
 

859
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,190
the first few are similar right so we
first of all we need to get a

860
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:33,200
first of all we need to get a
 

861
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,990
first of all we need to get a
r equals length a

862
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:36,000
r equals length a
 

863
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,470
r equals length a
and then we need to assert

864
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:38,480
and then we need to assert
 

865
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,870
and then we need to assert
r bigger than zero and then look c

866
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:40,880
r bigger than zero and then look c
 

867
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,630
r bigger than zero and then look c
equals length b

868
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:42,640
equals length b
 

869
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,470
equals length b
uh length a right we need to assert c is

870
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:46,480
uh length a right we need to assert c is
 

871
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,710
uh length a right we need to assert c is
p bigger than zero and we also need to

872
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:48,720
p bigger than zero and we also need to
 

873
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,870
p bigger than zero and we also need to
assert what come on this is different we

874
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:50,880
assert what come on this is different we
 

875
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,870
assert what come on this is different we
want to observe

876
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:52,880
want to observe
 

877
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,270

the b is one how many number of rows of
 

885
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,789
the b is one how many number of rows of
b is then b right

886
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:08,799
b is then b right

00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,150
a the size is r times c okay and then b
is length b

936
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:26,160
is length b
 

937
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,669
is length b
times the

1024
00:21:04,149 --> 00:21:04,159
because this is the
 

1025
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,270
because this is the
the final dimension is r times length p0

1026
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:07,280
the final dimension is r times length p0
 

1027
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,590
the final dimension is r times length p0
so we go into the first two two loops

1028
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:09,600
so we go into the first two two loops
 

1029
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,190
so we go into the first two two loops
we're going through each element in the

1030
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:11,200
we're going through each element in the
 

1031
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,070
we're going through each element in the
result right so and 4k will be in range

1032
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:14,080
result right so and 4k will be in range
 

1033
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,710
result right so and 4k will be in range
one in range bc yeah

1034
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:16,720
one in range bc yeah
 

1035
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,430
one in range bc yeah
because c uh let's

1036
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:19,440
because c uh let's
 

1037
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,110
because c uh let's
okay the ones you see let's do this uh i

1038
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:23,120
okay the ones you see let's do this uh i
 

1039
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,549
okay the ones you see let's do this uh i
j okay i say inventory now all i have to

1040
00:21:26,549 --> 00:21:26,559
j okay i say inventory now all i have to
 

1041
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:32,149
j okay i say inventory now all i have to
do is to sum up each one so m i j right

1042
00:21:32,149 --> 00:21:32,159
do is to sum up each one so m i j right
 

1043
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:39,750
do is to sum up each one so m i j right
m i j is this one yeah

1044
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:39,760

 

1045
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,350

this one times this one equals this one

1046
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:43,360
this one times this one equals this one
 

1047
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,549
this one times this one equals this one
right okay so look i'm timing this this

1048
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:46,559
right okay so look i'm timing this this
 

1049
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:47,510
right okay so look i'm timing this this
is a

1050
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:47,520
is a
 

1051
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,270
is a
this is b right i don't want to put it

1052
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:49,280
this is b right i don't want to put it
 

1053
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,510
this is b right i don't want to put it
here right i want to sum up here so each

1054
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:51,520
here right i want to sum up here so each
 

1055
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,190
here right i want to sum up here so each
one will be the

1056
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:53,200
one will be the
 

1057
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,830
one will be the
contribution from a to b that's a plus

1058
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:56,840
contribution from a to b that's a plus
 

1059
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,430
contribution from a to b that's a plus
equal what

1060
00:21:59,430 --> 00:21:59,440
equal what
 

1061
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,870
equal what

1087
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,029
j right okay and that's it return n
this is a bit trickier it's okay you

1088
00:22:29,029 --> 00:22:29,039
this is a bit trickier it's okay you
 

1089
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,590
this is a bit trickier it's okay you
don't understand anymore but take a look

1090
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:31,600
don't understand anymore but take a look
 

1091
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,870
don't understand anymore but take a look
so why this is m i k m i k here

00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,830
this is r
this is length b 0 let's call length b 0

1160
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:57,840
this is length b 0 let's call length b 0
 

1161
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:07,029
this is length b 0 let's call length b 0
no no let's be zero let's call it uh

let's call it i don't know x okay
 

1165
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,510
let's call it i don't know x okay
this is x if then b 0 is x

1166
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:13,520
this is x if then b 0 is x
 

1167
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,830
this is x if then b 0 is x
and what's the time constant

1168
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:16,840

1173
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,230

1175
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,110

1176
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:23,120
c
 

1177
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,110
c
you see three rules yeah inner loop in

1178
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:27,120
you see three rules yeah inner loop in
 

1179
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,510
you see three rules yeah inner loop in
in order to finish our loop each r loop

1180
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:29,520
in order to finish our loop each r loop
 

1181
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,029
in order to finish our loop each r loop
takes

1182
00:24:31,029 --> 00:24:31,039
takes
 

1183
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,470
takes
x loops each x loop takes c loops

1184
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:34,480
x loops each x loop takes c loops
 

1185
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,110
x loops each x loop takes c loops
yeah so the times of x is all r times x

1186
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:37,120
yeah so the times of x is all r times x
 

1187
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:44,230
yeah so the times of x is all r times x
times what's what's the space complexity

1188
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:44,240

 

1189
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,510

and what's the dimension of n

1190
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:49,520

 

1191
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,990

what's the x dimension come on

1192
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:52,000
what's the x dimension come on
 

1193
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,590
what's the x dimension come on
a what's the dimension x

1194
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:55,600
a what's the dimension x
 

1195
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,029
a what's the dimension x
number of rows number this is r times c

1196
00:24:59,029 --> 00:24:59,039
number of rows number this is r times c
 

1197
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,549
number of rows number this is r times c
and l when this is b is maybe y times

1198
00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:02,559
and l when this is b is maybe y times
 

1199
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,470
and l when this is b is maybe y times
c times x

1200
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:04,480
c times x
 

1201
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,110
c times x
c times x right

1202
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:07,120
c times x right
 

1203
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,710
c times x right
c times x what's that what's the

1204
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:08,720
c times x what's that what's the
 

1205
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,470
c times x what's that what's the
dimension of m

1206
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:10,480
dimension of m
 

1207
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,510
dimension of m
come on r times c and times this metric

1208
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:13,520
come on r times c and times this metric
 

1209
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,029
come on r times c and times this metric
a is item c

1210
00:25:15,029 --> 00:25:15,039
a is item c
 

1211
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,310
a is item c
times x r times x yes well done good job

1212
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:18,320
times x r times x yes well done good job
 

1213
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:28,789
times x r times x yes well done good job
yeah so let's play some next day

1214
00:25:28,789 --> 00:25:28,799

 

1215
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,549

okay that's it for today i i think you

1216
00:25:30,549 --> 00:25:30,559
okay that's it for today i i think you
 

1217

00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:32,640
got it tomorrow we keep talking about
 

1219
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,549
got it tomorrow we keep talking about
the magic we talk about okay a little

1220
00:25:34,549 --> 00:25:34,559
the magic we talk about okay a little
 

1221
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,190
the magic we talk about okay a little
preview for tomorrow we talk tomorrow

1222
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:37,200
preview for tomorrow we talk tomorrow
 

1223
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,669
preview for tomorrow we talk tomorrow
we'll talk about uh metric uh

1224
00:25:39,669 --> 00:25:39,679
we'll talk about uh metric uh
 

1225
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,230
we'll talk about uh metric uh
um

1226
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:42,240
um
 

1227
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,269
um
you know the

1228
00:25:43,269 --> 00:25:43,279
you know the
 

1229
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,590

uh
 

1235
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,029
uh
the inverse we have

1236
00:25:51,029 --> 00:25:51,039
the inverse we have
 

1237
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,029
the inverse we have
we mentioned about the division a

1238
00:25:53,029 --> 00:25:53,039
we mentioned about the division a
 

1239
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,789
we mentioned about the division a
divided by b

1240
00:25:54,789 --> 00:25:54,799
divided by b
 

1241
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,470
divided by b
okay

1242
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:56,480
okay
 

1243
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,310
okay
it's just

1244
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:58,320
it's just
 

1245
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,390
it's just
yeah it writes to be actually equal as

1246
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:00,400
yeah it writes to be actually equal as
 

1247
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,190
yeah it writes to be actually equal as
what

1248
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:01,200
what
 

1249
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,390
what
a times b minus one right right yeah

1250
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:04,400
a times b minus one right right yeah
 

1251
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,750
a times b minus one right right yeah
mathematics

1252
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:05,760
mathematics
 

1253
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,590
mathematics
two

1254
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:07,600
two
 

1255
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:12,950
two
two divided by four

1256
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:12,960

 

1257
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,269

equals what two times

1258
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:15,279
equals what two times
 

1259
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,590
equals what two times
four minus one right

1260
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:17,600
four minus one right
 

1261
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,990
four minus one right
yeah

1262
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:20,000

 

1263
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,909

yeah okay so

1264
00:26:21,909 --> 00:26:21,919
yeah okay so
 

1265
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,470
yeah okay so
is it yeah maybe yeah so what's this

1266
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:24,480
is it yeah maybe yeah so what's this
 

1267
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,630
is it yeah maybe yeah so what's this
minus one

1268
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:26,640
minus one
 

1269
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,269
minus one
so it's four times one divided by one

1270
00:26:29,269 --> 00:26:29,279
so it's four times one divided by one
 

1271
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,909
so it's four times one divided by one
okay so it's mathematics yeah so this

1272
00:26:31,909 --> 00:26:31,919
okay so it's mathematics yeah so this
 

1273
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,149
okay so it's mathematics yeah so this
this will this is called inverse so

1274
00:26:34,149 --> 00:26:34,159
this will this is called inverse so
 

1275
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,990
this will this is called inverse so
what's inverse

1276
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:36,000
what's inverse
 

1277
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,950
what's inverse
i

1278
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:36,960
i
 

1279
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,430
i
so something if a

1280
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:39,440
so something if a
 

1281
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,990
so something if a
times a minus one can you imagine equals

1282
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:42,000
times a minus one can you imagine equals
 

1283
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,590
times a minus one can you imagine equals
one

1284
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:43,600
one
 

1285
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,710
one
this is called inverse of a

1286
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:46,720
this is called inverse of a
 

1287
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,830
this is called inverse of a
you know

1288
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:47,840
you know
 

1289
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,909
you know

also
 

1291
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:51,669
also
we mentioned about some something here

1292
00:26:51,669 --> 00:26:51,679
we mentioned about some something here
 

1293
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:54,549
we mentioned about some something here
remember we talked about this a a minus

1294
00:26:54,549 --> 00:26:54,559
remember we talked about this a a minus
 

1295
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:57,909
remember we talked about this a a minus
y is the inverse of a

1296
00:26:57,909 --> 00:26:57,919
y is the inverse of a
 

1297
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,789
y is the inverse of a
you play times two

1298
00:27:00,789 --> 00:27:00,799
you play times two
 

1299
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,190
you play times two
come on to something you draw this four
