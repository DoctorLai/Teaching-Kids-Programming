1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,359
hello hello

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:08,480
hello mr alright yes okay so today we

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:10,880
talk about k and n

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:14,880
k and n

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,920
okay k a number and nearest neighbors

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,039
can you put that down it's quite

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,240
dangerous nearest name neighbors

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,240
mirrors

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,720
neighbors

10
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,080
[Music]

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,960
neighbors

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,519
so what does it mean what does it mean

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,279
10 so it's like it's a machine learning

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,320
you know have you heard the word machine

15
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,719
learning

16
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,200
computer can land right

17
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,879
yeah predict make a prediction

18
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,680
we ask computer to

19
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,120
make predictions to learn from data

20
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,039
learn

21
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,800
from data yeah data

22
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,360
okay or sometimes we call it data

23
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,879
training set yeah so what does this mean

24
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,399
so i'll give you an example so we have

25
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,680
we have a few

26
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,039
uh

27
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,120
you know we know already uh existing

28
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,440
data and then if

29
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,640
you're given a new input what would be

30
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,760
the output

31
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,799
if this data if this fx

32
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,600
this look

33
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,680
okay

34
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,000
the function that takes the input x can

35
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,320
you put it down please question yeah

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,240
and then it generates the output yeah

37
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,560
output right output

38
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,040
but we don't know what's fx it's a very

39
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,040
complex model for example right

40
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,880
yeah yeah

41
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,280
for example like uh

42
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,960
it's very very complex for example the

43
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,360
computer predict the weather what's the

44
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,240
weather going to be like tomorrow

45
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,240
right it depends on lots of factors

46
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,200
right the temperature

47
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,560
the the

48
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,680
seasons

49
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,799
right

50
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,600
the the locations right

51
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,920
yeah

52
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,439
and the humidity yeah immediately yeah

53
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,520
and what's the going to what's the

54
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,399
weather going to be like

55
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,960
so

56
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:57,280
we don't know that the model or we can't

57
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,000
express this model in mathematics like

58
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,479
simple mathematic equation right but

59
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,439
so but we know already from his uh

60
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:08,319
history data yeah we know already it

61
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,160
happens before right

62
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,080
all right so so for example we have at

63
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,800
least input right

64
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,080
so maybe like like input

65
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,000
uh

66
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,840
temperature

67
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,400
temperature yeah

68
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:27,280
and what else

69
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,280
what that temperature like humidity

70
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,840
humidity yeah is it how do you spell

71
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,800
this one yeah i don't know what do you

72
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,599
mean

73
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,280
you know

74
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,720
the how wet really the

75
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,920
air right

76
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,160
something like that

77
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,440
and what location

78
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,480
yeah

79
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,239
yeah

80
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,440
location

81
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,480
location

82
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,239
so you we we have uh we have observed

83
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,239
this kind of data in the past right so

84
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,120
something like 25 degree

85
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,599
you know

86
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,400
you know maybe 30 percent yeah and the

87
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:02,159
weather will be sunny for example sunny

88
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,239
and then something like

89
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,920
something like it will be raining right

90
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,040
raining

91
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,519
okay

92
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,519
so these datas are we collected

93
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,440
we already have this data

94
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,239
right and we want to build a very

95
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:20,720
complex model yeah to given

96
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,720
uh tomorrow so x could be the

97
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,599
yeah x could be the

98
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,360
input right so we can

99
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,959
we know the location temperature

100
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,400
humidity for now and we want to predict

101
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,280
the weather tomorrow

102
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,360
right

103
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,599
and you'll be very complex and then we

104
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,720
ask computer to predict let's make a

105
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,360
prediction

106
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,080
based on what we know so far let's call

107
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,519
machine learning right so the data the

108
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,120
pc the

109
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,310
computer will work out right work out

110
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,720
the

111
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,640
[Music]

112
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,640
likelihood of the different kind of

113
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,920
weather based on this data

114
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,439
okay basic kind of machine learning

115
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,799
make sense

116
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:02,879
yeah okay so another example

117
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,640
another example could be it could be

118
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,319
simpler

119
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,120
okay so i have a

120
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:11,040
i have two two shapes on the only one

121
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,120
space

122
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,799
triangle

123
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,919
square

124
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,199
triangle triangles square

125
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:20,400
square

126
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,639
square

127
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,000
triangles and squares yeah that's true

128
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:28,639
triangles square

129
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,520
this yes okay

130
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,360
so

131
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,600
can you tell me

132
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,960
can you tell me

133
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,520
so i have a point here

134
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,050
so is it triangle is it

135
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,240
squared

136
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:44,479
[Music]

137
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,680
no no no i mean if i want to draw a

138
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,520
shape here

139
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,639
right this is the known input for the

140
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,680
computer

141
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,960
right like the weather thingy right we

142
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,360
have known

143
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,160
that at these points it would

144
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,759
a square and now there's a new input the

145
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,160
computer you ask computer to predict

146
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,000
what's the shape here

147
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,479
more likely you know

148
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,120
what's more what's likely to be a shape

149
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:11,440
here triangular square

150
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,880
um square

151
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:18,160
square where down why is this square

152
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:22,160
why is it square yeah it's square why

153
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:25,759
likely yeah it's likelihood more likely

154
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,840
likelihood okay so machine learning is

155
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,919
it won't solve a prediction problem it

156
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,280
could have at least there

157
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:34,160
um

158
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,680
you know it's not like 100 accurate it's

159
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,479
it's more like uh

160
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,840
optimum um like heuristic heuristic

161
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,759
heuristic yeah

162
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,000
uh so we also predict here and then the

163
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,880
computer will say it's a square so why

164
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,759
you say it's a square

165
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,720
come on

166
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,560
yeah

167
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,400
the arrow is square why

168
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,720
unless you can say it's a triangle and

169
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,920
you can base another story just explain

170
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,639
your thoughts why is this square here

171
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:04,720
[Music]

172
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,800
in what you do your instinct why is a

173
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,319
square here

174
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,919
i just guessed

175
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,520
and what based on what why is this

176
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,240
square square

177
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,600
a good guess yeah y is a square guess

178
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,240
how do you guess is the square oh it's

179
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,240
just learning this

180
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,720
it could be look

181
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:29,520
i'm at this point yeah i'm response

182
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,080
so if i k equals three i want to pick

183
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,880
the three nearest neighbors so at this

184
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,080
point

185
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,280
distance what are the three shortest

186
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,919
distance

187
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,919
to this point

188
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:47,620
if i put a triangle

189
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:50,080
what's the three circles distance

190
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:53,039
[Music]

191
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:56,160
yeah so these are three shot is decent k

192
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:57,199
equals here normally can you see

193
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,759
it could be

194
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,599
if there are only two possibilities

195
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,400
triangle and square

196
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:06,800
and we want to pick a k which is odd

197
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,039
so there is no even vote

198
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,680
yeah because there are two possibilities

199
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:14,800
and if i have three votes what does it

200
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,720
mean always one wins right yeah

201
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,880
two triangles

202
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,080
one two x square all two squares one

203
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,240
triangle right

204
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,639
yeah it it we don't have this even

205
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,960
though right if you put a k equals four

206
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,039
what could be the even both two square

207
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,639
two triangle you can't pick right so k

208
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:34,080
equals three so we pick the three nearly

209
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,440
one triangle

210
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,639
two squared

211
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:41,280
so we will vote for what

212
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,680
square square easy yeah that's how you

213
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,400
get guess let's yeah we will make a

214
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,240
guess based on this case okay easy yeah

215
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,080
this is machine learning let's simplify

216
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,560
this machine learning algorithm right

217
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,520
you ask computer to make a guess

218
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:59,599
based on what based on the existing data

219
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:02,479
we know this existing data existing data

220
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,919
existing data and we also call it data

221
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,919
set

222
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,560
training set data set training training

223
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:10,479
set training data set

224
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,560
yeah because these data are used to

225
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,800
train the computer

226
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,319
right what if you

227
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,360
did

228
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,520
sorry

229
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,120
will it be on the grid or something oh

230
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,240
my goodness

231
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,879
um because what if you don't know um

232
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,639
which one is close uh

233
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,720
okay how do you catch a circus display

234
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,880
right yeah only green yeah the distance

235
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,399
shut it distance you know that distance

236
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,159
you could be there that could be two

237
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,429
times the distance

238
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,839
the

239
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:39,680
[Music]

240
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,320
the distance yeah look

241
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,959
what kind of distance can you get

242
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:49,040
well if you have like one square and one

243
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:51,760
triangle close yeah and x y

244
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:55,040
what if um you had this um

245
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,760
point and a

246
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,720
is

247
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,800
one square one triangle and and and

248
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,200
there is another one um

249
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,640
called one circle

250
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,839
and then

251
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,880
another one that

252
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,800
also

253
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,080
um triangle and

254
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,920
square but

255
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,600
they're the same

256
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,839
from that point

257
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,080
where they're okay so if okay so that's

258
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,080
a very good choice yeah you have three

259
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,480
things three votes but one of them is

260
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,640
triangle one on one square and

261
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,560
one on and there are two right

262
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,480
in this case you just pick one on it's

263
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,040
it's just fifty fifty

264
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,160
or you could increase the k right to

265
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,920
five

266
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,560
yeah instead of picking three you're

267
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,640
picking five to see more yeah to get

268
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,320
more right got it

269
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,440
they understand what i'm saying yeah

270
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,800
yeah okay very clever very good yeah i

271
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,560
just thought i didn't think of that

272
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,040
before yeah but yeah you make a joke

273
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,640
that's a very special corner case okay

274
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,480
so we talk about distance there are two

275
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,399
kinds of distance you can

276
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,440
maybe you know look this is a point

277
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,360
right

278
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,120
x1

279
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,600
y1 right

280
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,640
x1 y1 okay yeah

281
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,720
so this is x1

282
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,720
this bit yeah

283
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,279
here is y1 okay

284
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,200
and another point here

285
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,320
okay so here

286
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,360
x2

287
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,880
here

288
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,760
y2 okay

289
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,720
what

290
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,360
got it

291
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,880
yeah what's the distance distance look

292
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,800
this sides could be

293
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,800
x1 minus x2 squared

294
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:37,360
plus y1 minus y2 square and then

295
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:39,519
square root that's one distance

296
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,720
right because we're only interested this

297
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,399
distance yeah

298
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,040
this distance

299
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:48,800
what's the distance it's equals to what

300
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:52,480
so this bit is x2 minus x1 this bit

301
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:55,360
this bit is what y2 minus y1 right so we

302
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,600
know this a b what's the distance look

303
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:02,000
we talk about this triangle thingy right

304
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,000
triangle this is a this is b what's this

305
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:08,800
no c what's the what's c

306
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:11,760
c what's c c square equals one

307
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,640
remember a square

308
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,440
b

309
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,320
yeah okay and it's all positive

310
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,720
yeah

311
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,800
got it that's that's where it comes from

312
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,880
and there's another distance called

313
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:26,480
manhattan distance which is just this x1

314
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,519
minus x2

315
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,240
plus

316
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:32,800
y1 minus y2 look what's this look at

317
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,120
this absolute value right

318
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,360
that's the true value so look if this is

319
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,839
three this is four

320
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,399
if this three this is four the distance

321
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:45,360
the my hands and distance would be three

322
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:47,279
three plus four equals seven

323
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,959
but the the first one i don't know what

324
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,160
what's the distance is four yeah this

325
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,639
one will be

326
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,639
three square plus four square

327
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,959
square root equals five okay so now two

328
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:59,760
distance you can choose any of them yeah

329
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:05,040
remember we picked the shortest distance

330
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:05,040
on the previous right yeah okay

331
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,839
so what are we trying to solve here if

332
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,399
this problem is quite complex and we

333
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:15,760
don't have a deterministic you know

334
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:19,120
deterministic what's deterministic

335
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:22,240
we don't have a deterministic way to

336
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:24,079
predict it so for example this fx the

337
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,920
model could become quite complex you

338
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:28,079
have you have the input

339
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,839
yeah we want to get the output so what's

340
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,600
the output

341
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,880
what's the output right

342
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:37,680
right fx right

343
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,839
you have a lot of training data and

344
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,639
we want to know what's the output

345
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,560
okay

346
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:47,600
so let's let's do this k n so

347
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,839
what's here so we find the k nearest

348
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,760
neighbors to the input and then we get

349
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,000
the average we can do the average of it

350
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,160
right or we pick a medium or we put the

351
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,839
weighted average right so there are lots

352
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,360
of ways but first of all is we need to

353
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,639
find the k

354
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,120
nearest

355
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:05,600
neighbors to the input right

356
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,800
okay and then we can do the average of

357
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,480
it

358
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,959
yeah

359
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,200
or we do the vote if it's if you want to

360
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,880
labeling right if we want

361
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,079
if there are two choice

362
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,200
okay

363
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:21,600
signed or square we we count a vote

364
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,480
whoever wins whoever got the major votes

365
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:27,040
wins right in that previous case

366
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,040
there are two votes of the squares

367
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,440
so we tend to vote

368
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,240
for that that point that's a square

369
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,279
right

370
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,600
yeah

371
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:37,440
and if if it's a value right if it's

372
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:41,360
already it could be chosen as a value

373
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,480
for example like look let's do this

374
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,160
x y

375
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,120
if we do have a

376
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,800
graph y equals x square right

377
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,519
yeah

378
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,920
remember we call it called

379
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,160
less thingy i don't know the little

380
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,079
graph yeah

381
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:01,120
nothing yeah look

382
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:02,480
look this one yeah y equals x squared is

383
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,600
this one right

384
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,720
yeah when x is zero y is zero what x one

385
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,360
y is one

386
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,760
one x is two four right

387
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,959
three nine yeah

388
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,160
okay

389
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,399
so if

390
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,880
if f x is

391
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:22,079
x square you know and then we pick a

392
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:24,800
value like if if it's 1.5

393
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:26,320
1.5 so let's pick them

394
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,639
k equals three

395
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,320
what are the three closest neighbors to

396
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,720
1.5

397
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:35,600
if if we have a training data on

398
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,920
integers yeah one

399
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,160
two

400
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,240
could be zero or three right it doesn't

401
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:45,040
matter we pick one three

402
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,800
okay yeah all right

403
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,880
and then what what's the

404
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,880
so what's the out what's the prediction

405
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:54,160
so we know these three are the three

406
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,440
nearest neighbors so look what is y this

407
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,279
is one right

408
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:03,120
f1 equals one f2 equals

409
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:06,079
4 right f3 equals

410
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,160
s2 equals 1 3 squared equals 1

411
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,040
9 9 okay so what's the average of this

412
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:14,399
one

413
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:14,399
1 plus 4 plus 9 divided by 3 equals

414
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,519
about

415
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,360
5

416
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,040
14 divided by

417
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:25,639
sorry

418
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,639
is about 5. is it about 5

419
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,480
three

420
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,480
four

421
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,160
uh

422
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:41,920
so we picked a stream near his neighbor

423
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:44,560
could be yeah one two three

424
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,079
okay but but this is the difference the

425
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,720
error rate

426
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,880
you know if this is the

427
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,440
uh produce too much error right because

428
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,839
it's e equals to five but

429
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,320
look it's not five right if you if you

430
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,240
pick this if you pick this what happened

431
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,920
if you pick this neighbor

432
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,639
right if you pick one two three you get

433
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:07,040
the five if you pick zero one two

434
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,880
right i put a zero here so what's the

435
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,160
what's that

436
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,120
what's the

437
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,680
average one plus three one plus four

438
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,040
plus zero divided by three

439
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,600
yeah

440
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,959
five divided by three

441
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,959
one point

442
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,639
roughly 1.7 right

443
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:27,360
yeah

444
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:29,839
so you see by picking but the the

445
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:33,600
correct answer the correct prediction is

446
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:35,199
1.5 squared will be 2.25 okay so which

447
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,040
one is closer

448
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:40,560
which one is closer

449
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,759
1.7 right 1.7 instead of

450
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,120
5 right

451
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:48,000
this one is closer so you see

452
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,839
they they produce a larger difference

453
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,680
depending on how you pick the neighbors

454
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:54,000
yeah yeah

455
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,639
if we pick if we increase the k

456
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,519
if we increase the k that the

457
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,800
the accuracy might improve

458
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,959
make sense

459
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,799
or if we have too many if we have more

460
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,400
data points around

461
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:08,559
if we let's say if we have more data

462
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,039
points around the 1.5 right

463
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:13,280
if i have one more data point around one

464
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:15,919
and then the accuracy will be very close

465
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,480
to 2.35 it depends on how how these

466
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,559
status so you see that what can you tell

467
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,000
me what's the advantage and disadvantage

468
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,240
of knn

469
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,959
okay based on this the advantage and

470
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,120
disadvantage

471
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,679
advantage

472
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:34,240
simple yeah we just pick the k nearest

473
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:36,000
name and make an average am right oh

474
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,160
yeah what's the disadvantage the

475
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,840
accuracy depends on how you pick how

476
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,080
where are the neighbors right

477
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:45,039
yeah you could produce a very large

478
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,880
difference right you see yeah

479
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,320
and if there are a thousand a million

480
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,799
data sets

481
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:53,120
data points

482
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:55,440
it could be very slow to

483
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,360
to evaluate the distance right the

484
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,240
certificate if they acquire a lot of

485
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:02,559
these data points right if there are n

486
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,760
data points the time complexity will be

487
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,280
o n right

488
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,720
right because you need to go through

489
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,320
this n

490
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,720
to find

491
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,080
to calculate the distance

492
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,919
and also

493
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,679
okay you need to sort it right you need

494
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:18,080
to sort of find the distance uh find the

495
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,000
shortest distance so if you sort it

496
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,799
you'll be always logged in

497
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,200
right but if you if we're using the hip

498
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:28,080
hip remember the heat the binary kind of

499
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,080
binary tree right

500
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:34,080
this is the biggest always speaking if

501
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,240
you don't mean here this is the smallest

502
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,799
of in the binary and then you'll be

503
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,400
reduced the time convexity will be

504
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,880
okay

505
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,720
log n right this is a bit better than

506
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,760
over n again right because k is smaller

507
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,160
than

508
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,080
n right much smaller than n so

509
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,160
a okay looking right

510
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,640
huh makes sense

511
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:58,640
okay so let's write uh the structure of

512
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,760
o n okay and you tell me okay

513
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,400
define

514
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:05,600
k and n

515
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,919
okay our input is x yeah

516
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,960
and then n equals let's say equals three

517
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,559
okay

518
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,640
by default yeah we can put a default

519
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:14,880
value can we put the difference if we

520
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,280
don't pass the default value you'll be

521
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,160
uh you if you don't pass the end you'll

522
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,120
be

523
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,559
uh

524
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,559
you'll be three yeah so we need to

525
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,640
answer first of all we need to answer

526
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,679
and bigger let's say bigger equals three

527
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,039
okay

528
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,039
okay

529
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:31,120
now we have a data point let's say the

530
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:34,000
data is here okay it's existing here

531
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,720
okay but we're putting here data is here

532
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,400
and

533
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,480
let's fill the data for example let's

534
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,840
fill the

535
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:45,039
let's feel the value of x as fx equals s

536
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,039
square okay let's say

537
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,880
this is uh this complex model is f x

538
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,480
here but these theta could be take a

539
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,000
could we already know and so we just

540
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,960
need to follow

541
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,039
i in red let's just fill the data here

542
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,440
but we can move this outside okay let's

543
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:03,840
let's move this outside for example

544
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:07,120
maybe we'll put a data here

545
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:09,280
data here okay down here and equation

546
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,600
okay so for example this data what does

547
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:14,559
it look like it's a dictionary and for i

548
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,159
in range let's say to minus 100 to 100

549
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:17,520
minus 1

550
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:20,880
101

551
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:23,840
and then what theta i

552
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,600
equals i times i right i times i squared

553
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,840
okay so when we fill the data yeah we

554
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,240
feel the data the data the keys

555
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,320
okay so now let's let's we have already

556
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,600
we already have this data theta is the

557
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:37,200
keys theta is like key value pairs right

558
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,000
for example one

559
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,520
one

560
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,919
two four

561
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:44,000
three nine something that i depending on

562
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:47,120
on your data it could be

563
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,640
complex this is the given mode uh given

564
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,120
already

565
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,120
historical data historical data we

566
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,919
already know training set

567
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,919
yeah training sets financing

568
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:01,440
training set

569
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:02,480
training set okay training set

570
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,520
and now

571
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:08,240
we want to find uh

572
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:10,480
we we want to calculate distance to all

573
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,360
the data points in the

574
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,600
uh in the training set okay so now let's

575
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,360
say we want to

576
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,080
get a cost

577
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,799
cost equals what because it's

578
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,760
an array right let's say

579
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,799
i

580
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,840
and then abs the distance yeah we can

581
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:33,200
calculate the distance right

582
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:35,360
i x i to the distance i minus x this is

583
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,400
the distance right and that's the tuple

584
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:41,520
the first value is the

585
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,360
the the the neighbor and the second

586
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,640
value of the tube is the distance is the

587
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,799
cost the

588
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,159
the distance to x right we use the

589
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:52,240
absolute value

590
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:54,320
and one for i in theta right

591
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,480
for i in data

592
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,480
okay and now we know we can we now need

593
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,400
to solve it yeah let's use the normal

594
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,280
sword okay

595
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,760
cost

596
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,520
the thought right but we want to sort by

597
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,240
what t

598
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,240
t right

599
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:15,039
equals x one right

600
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,360
okay

601
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,720
so we want to solve solve the cos array

602
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,039
by by

603
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,200
by by the distance in ascending order

604
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:26,240
that's what it means number x

605
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,760
x x one because x is the tuple right x0

606
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:32,000
is the neighbor

607
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:34,159
x1 is the cost is the distance

608
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,480
yeah why we need to solve the distance

609
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,600
we want to find out the

610
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,120
shortest

611
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,760
k

612
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,679
neighbors am right

613
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,480
are you are you with me

614
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:48,559
yeah excuse me

615
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:51,120
what's the terminology of this one if

616
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:53,039
there are n if that length of the data

617
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:56,080
is n what's the time that complex if we

618
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:58,240
sort an array with n numbers

619
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,640
what's the time complexity if we saw the

620
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,640
numbers

621
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:05,790
[Music]

622
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,840
so if we're using the heap if you're

623
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,159
using the heap the time capacity could

624
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:14,000
be improved as okay

625
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,360
log n right

626
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,480
yeah

627
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,559
okay

628
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,559
the heap yeah because we need to every

629
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:23,120
time we maintain a

630
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:25,520
heap we we insert the number

631
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:28,240
into a hip it needs to all log in

632
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:30,799
right and how many times we need to

633
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,039
take uh you know to take a number max

634
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:34,559
number or shortest number smallest

635
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:37,760
number from the hip

636
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:39,360
okay so this hip here

637
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,120
every time we take a

638
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,679
this is smallest hip

639
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:46,480
i will take it off one time but we need

640
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:49,120
to rebuild the hip let's look in and how

641
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:51,919
many times we need to take it do this

642
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:54,480
k times right because we need to k take

643
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,279
compute the k nearest right

644
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,520
yeah

645
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:59,440
so you need to okay which is better oh

646
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,720
and okay no okay logan

647
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:04,400
which is better okay why is that

648
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,720
because

649
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:09,440
k is

650
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,120
more than n right yeah and could be a

651
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,559
larger meaning if there are a million

652
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,200
data points right

653
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:17,279
this is obvious this is

654
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,559
much better because k k could be three

655
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:22,799
okay three compares to a minion

656
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:26,080
right i do it three times i do it a

657
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:28,159
million times which is faster

658
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,880
obviously yeah good job

659
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:34,320
okay now we sort it we saw it we saw

660
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:37,520
this already now we need to find out the

661
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,799
smallest one okay then we can return now

662
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:42,480
written what

663
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:44,960
that is we want to sum it first some

664
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,520
somewhat some

665
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,360
you data

666
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,840
the data

667
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,640
theta y x

668
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:55,760
uh x y x y x

669
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:58,080
zero yeah because 0 is the neighbor

670
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,080
right

671
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,679
4

672
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:05,279
x in

673
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:06,000
okay so data now i uh now now the cost

674
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,400
yeah

675
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,360
the cost is the

676
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,640
it's already sorted so cost

677
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,279
up to k

678
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,760
after n right after n is the first the

679
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:19,760
shortest the shortest season cost n

680
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,159
right so in cost

681
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,600
because up to n right

682
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:25,840
out to n

683
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,840
yeah because cost is

684
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:30,159
already sorted right sorted the first

685
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,760
element is that neighbor so we taking

686
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:33,919
the neighbors

687
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,679
the second one is the distance distance

688
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,000
to the input

689
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:39,679
right this is the sum and we how do we

690
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,520
get calculate the average how do we

691
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:43,919
calculate the average

692
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:47,120
how do we calculate average

693
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:50,799
we have some we have a how many numbers

694
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:52,240
what's the sum how many how many numbers

695
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,039
how many elements

696
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,600
are

697
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:59,440
a layer in in in here

698
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,440
how many numbers how many elements

699
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,840
and yeah so we just need to divide

700
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:07,360
divide n right this is sum yeah sum

701
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,159
divided by n is the average yeah

702
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,240
yeah

703
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,080
yeah this is average we don't you have

704
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:15,120
to get it so

705
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,320
overall this is the simplest clear and

706
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,960
uh

707
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,760
demonstration yeah so if

708
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:24,320
we use the average here but sometimes we

709
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:26,480
could use the weighted average right or

710
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,240
we could use the medium

711
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,000
or we could use some other functions

712
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,960
yeah this could be changed right this

713
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,039
could be adapted to different needs and

714
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:38,000
the sorting as i said could be

715
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:38,880
improved to okay login based on the heap

716
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,720
right

717
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,240
and then this input yeah input could be

718
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,559
different something it would be quite a

719
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,159
complex

720
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:48,159
you know complex

721
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:50,400
could be a vector right instead of

722
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,480
singular look this is x is the value

723
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,360
like how about it could be

724
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,279
a

725
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:57,120
a few variables right you could it could

726
00:26:55,279 --> 00:27:00,080
be a vector and then you need to compute

727
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:02,000
the distance functions so the distance

728
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,120
function may not be may not be so

729
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,559
obvious because

730
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,960
in this case it's quite obvious yeah

731
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:09,200
because we're given a number f2 right

732
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,279
three what's the distance between three

733
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,080
and two easy three minus two distance

734
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:16,000
right absolute value right yeah

735
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,559
but it could be very complex distance

736
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,960
functions like it could be something you

737
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:22,399
know it could be a few uh

738
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:26,080
uh uh

739
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:28,399
a hundred values and what could be

740
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,880
distance by pitching those right

741
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,840
yeah or maybe two two values two values

742
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,559
x y

743
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:36,720
then you can calculate the distance at

744
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:38,720
distance yeah look if it's two elements

745
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,600
we could calculate the manhattan

746
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,799
distance we usually talk about right is

747
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:46,080
is what

748
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:48,559
absolute value of delta x data yeah data

749
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,559
what data is the difference between two

750
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:52,880
x values plus

751
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:55,360
absolute value of delta y okay

752
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:59,120
yeah or you could use this as a square

753
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:01,679
root from here square root beta x

754
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,480
square plus theta y

755
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,600
square

756
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,840
yeah the

757
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,760
less the two vector if there are even

758
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,520
input tangents to value and how about

759
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,520
three values so i value five values you

760
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:14,399
could define different distance

761
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:17,200
functions right for the input right

762
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:19,440
okay and data we talk about data data

763
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,520
could be very huge

764
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,279
so if it's very huge then the time the

765
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:25,440
performance of this kn could be very

766
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:27,600
slow because at real time you need to

767
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,760
evaluate the cost

768
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:32,159
of the input to the existing data in the

769
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,600
training set it could be slow right and

770
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:36,320
if we reduce that

771
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:38,559
if we reduce the data set

772
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:41,279
what what could happen accuracy might

773
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:42,880
might be my degree a lot right

774
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:44,720
it depends on how you choose the data

775
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,880
generally the more data

776
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,480
the better the higher p

777
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,159
accuracy am i right

778
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,960
yeah

779
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,840
yeah

780
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,039
but

781
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,919
as i said

782
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:58,240
the more data the slower and if we

783
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:01,279
reduce the number of the training data

784
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:03,039
we will also degrade the uh

785
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:05,279
degree the performance

786
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:07,520
right if only there are only a few data

787
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:10,960
sets then the prediction will be quite

788
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:13,039
highly biased right because it could be

789
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:16,000
it could be you know picking

790
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:18,720
some actual uh you know some incorrect

791
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,360
data sets data data points from this

792
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,279
data set it produced totally incorrect

793
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,399
prediction right and n equals three is

794
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,799
usually k

795
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:27,840
and k could be

796
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:30,159
five

797
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,600
seven you know nine those odd number

798
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,840
which is better right because we don't

799
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,520
we don't we don't want to avoid

800
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,279
we we don't want to you know we don't

801
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:40,159
want to

802
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:42,960
so why like n it needs to be odd because

803
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:44,640
we don't want the even votes right

804
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,320
as i said in the beginning triangle

805
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,360
square if we have

806
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:51,360
four if n equals four what could happen

807
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,600
two volts belongs to triangle two volts

808
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:56,720
belong to square and then we can make a

809
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:59,440
choice right but if it's k equals three

810
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:01,520
then we always can make a choice right

811
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,200
because there's a majority right that's

812
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,760
the majority

813
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,120
uh okay so that that's the k n that's

814
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,679
the machine learning that's the very

815
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:12,720
simplest machine learning accurate model

816
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:15,360
okay any questions so far

817
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,440
is it interesting useful

818
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:20,240
yeah it's for yeah

819
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:23,200
you see only one nine two one three nine

820
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:25,440
three nines implement of knm machine

821
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,679
learning algorithm okay

822
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,919
you see how powerful is that

823
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:30,720
okay

824
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:33,200
yeah

825
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,159
okay you want to say bye bye to people

826
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,640
bye

827
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:39,520
bye bye more update please can you be

828
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,520
more happy please

829
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,159
okay bye
