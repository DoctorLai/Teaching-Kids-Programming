1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,279
let me say mr right now right yeah

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:08,000
so let's say we have these

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,120
numbers of unique integers yeah one two

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,800
three

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,920
yeah and we want to find out the subset

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,280
the subset is a like like this emptiness

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,560
is a subset

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,840
one

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,680
two

10
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,160
three

11
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,519
one two

12
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,760
two three

13
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,800
eight one two three

14
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,039
eight eight one is missing eight

15
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,640
one two three four five six seven one is

16
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,680
missing can you find find out what is

17
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,200
this one three one three exactly so

18
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,040
that's eight yeah

19
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,520
there's three numbers so the total

20
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,480
number of subset is two to the power of

21
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,800
three eight why is it two to the power 3

22
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,800
we have n numbers for each number we

23
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,520
have two choices yeah

24
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,039
we take it or we don't pick it

25
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,399
so for the first number we have two

26
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,160
choice for the second number we have

27
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,559
another two choice third number and

28
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,120
another choice so it's two times two

29
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,000
times two which is nine

30
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,640
yeah

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,280
two and then end of it yeah and this

32
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,320
leads to two to the power of n

33
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:13,200
two to the power of another set of

34
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,479
problems which is kind of permutation

35
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,920
permutation what is permutation like one

36
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,439
two three

37
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,799
one three two

38
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,200
two one three

39
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,560
two three one three one two three two

40
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,400
one okay

41
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,520
these are full permutations they are n

42
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,920
numbers

43
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:33,680
so the total number of permutation is

44
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:37,040
how many can you tell me anybody

45
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,759
total number permutation anybody

46
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,280
yes six which is if there are n numbers

47
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,759
what's the total number

48
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,759
18

49
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,479
and one

50
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,680
and the first number we how many choice

51
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,280
we have

52
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,439
three

53
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,040
three number three choice

54
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,000
the second number how many choice we

55
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,200
have

56
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,280
three

57
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,280
no we already use one number so how many

58
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,640
numbers we we can pick from

59
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:07,520
two yeah and that's a number one

60
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,599
bacteria okay another another set of

61
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,720
problem is called computation com

62
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:15,599
combination combination three apples how

63
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,360
many ways to pick two apples

64
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,640
three helpers how many ways to pick two

65
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,800
apples

66
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,560
three yeah

67
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,000
it's the same as three apples picking

68
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,680
one apple right

69
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,520
if you look at this way three apples

70
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,879
picking one diaper is very easy yeah

71
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,560
there's three apples how many ways to

72
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,480
pick one at first

73
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,319
three yeah every time you pick one up

74
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,480
it's the same as you pick two weapons

75
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,640
because they are they correspond to each

76
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,760
other okay so c

77
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,400
and k equals c

78
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,879
and n minus k this is the same because

79
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,360
every time you pick k numbers

80
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:52,560
out of n is the same as picking n minus

81
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:55,360
k out of n right because look n

82
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,000
n minus k plus k equals n this is same

83
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,319
okay so this is the formula c nk equals

84
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,319
n factorial divided by k factorial

85
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,400
divided by n minus k factorial and we

86
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:07,840
talked about this long time ago right

87
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,840
permutation is p and k equals

88
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,680
equals 1 equals

89
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,200
c n k

90
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,080
times

91
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,800
times

92
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,200
k

93
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,440
factorial right because

94
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,519
when we pick k numbers

95
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,319
and then we can do a full commutation on

96
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,440
these k numbers okay so these would be

97
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,159
one

98
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,319
so so these will be c and k is this one

99
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:33,519
so times k factorial will be a and

100
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:35,519
factorial divided by n minus k factorial

101
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,519
yeah you can think of this way what's

102
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,799
for permutation

103
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:43,280
you pick a k apples out of n epoch and

104
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,920
after you get k approach we can do a

105
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,080
full permutation of cake apples so that

106
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,720
gives dnk okay

107
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,519
okay so for going back to this question

108
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,040
so

109
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,959
going back to this question we can do

110
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,879
this step research or

111
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,159
actually we call it a backtracking or

112
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,799
whatever i mean

113
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:03,519
so we can come up with a

114
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:06,640
recursive uh recursion so for each

115
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:10,000
number let's say

116
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:12,480
we define let's say subset subset and we

117
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,159
have this number which is the list of

118
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,320
integer

119
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:20,160
and then we want to return

120
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,359
a list of this yeah instead of this

121
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,639
okay

122
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,680
list of this

123
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:28,240
so n equals the length of numbers so

124
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,320
this is the numbers of numbers the

125
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,320
the numbers of numbers right the numbers

126
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,320
are the lengths of the numbers

127
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,040
and then we can say answer

128
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,600
equals empty list and we have this step

129
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,120
first search okay i define it as dfs but

130
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,800
nonetheless the way it's called the

131
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,639
preferences define

132
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,440
efs

133
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,360
what current is the length of uh is the

134
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,759
current choice from the set of the

135
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,800
subset and then we are picking the ice

136
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,320
number

137
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,479
so when we finish picking the when we

138
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,440
reach the last number then we can

139
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:03,360
obviously we can answer the append

140
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,680
current right and then we depend because

141
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,919
we are running out of numbers

142
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,160
and then we can return

143
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,080
okay so now for the ice number how many

144
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,479
choice do we have

145
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,840
you know we are picking this we are now

146
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,479
look at this one

147
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,639
this is original numbers one two three

148
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:23,280
okay then one i

149
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,759
is zero i is yellow here

150
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,160
yeah for the first number

151
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,240
so how many choice do we have when

152
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,759
considering the subset

153
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,479
how many we how many choice do we have

154
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:39,120
when put considering the number one in a

155
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,639
subset

156
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,560
okay

157
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,320
am i clear how many choices do we have

158
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,919
when conserving the numbers in the

159
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,840
subset what number is one we were

160
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,800
talking about these numbers only we are

161
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,919
now looking at these numbers i

162
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,479
numbs at index i okay so

163
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:59,199
now i'm going to do something here

164
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:02,000
i'm going to do something here

165
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:04,160
with list numbers i regarding into the

166
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,160
current subset so

167
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,560
i want to please number how many choice

168
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,720
do we have with this number with the

169
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,600
current now with the current set it's

170
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,280
one two three and one two three

171
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,880
there are eight how do you get the

172
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,840
number eight here

173
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,319
ryan

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:23,280
how do we get the number eight here i

175
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,479
mean t times two times two exactly

176
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,880
what's two

177
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,639
two is how many choices you have okay

178
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,080
how many choices do we have for this

179
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,400
number

180
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,639
we want to put it in how many choices

181
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,639
are

182
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,680
they are n numbers yeah you are right

183
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,600
two to the power and for each number we

184
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,360
have two choices here for each number

185
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,560
how many choices

186
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,560
how many choices do we have

187
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:52,000
yeah exactly two two choice okay two

188
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,840
choice to pick it okay so let's talk

189
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,440
about not pick it at first

190
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,440
we not pick it

191
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,280
so if we don't pick it what happened to

192
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,720
the current

193
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,800
what happened to the color if we don't

194
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,479
pick it

195
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,199
it's still the same right

196
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,639
but

197
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,280
the next one we're looking we're going

198
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:13,360
to pick i plus one right yeah

199
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,360
okay so if we pick it what happened

200
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,680
if we pick it what happened what should

201
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,599
i do with the current if i pick it i

202
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,759
should add it to the current right so

203
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:24,000
carbon plus

204
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,440
num i

205
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,560
okay

206
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,000
and then

207
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,319
we do this step research at the

208
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,840
beginning we start with the empty v and

209
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,840
i go first number what's the second

210
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,800
parameter here

211
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,800
the first one which is

212
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:43,039
yeah and now we can just return

213
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,400
answer okay

214
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,479
yeah

215
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,680
okay so this is the

216
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:52,879
core of our learning today so for each

217
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,479
number we can pick or we can skip when

218
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,960
we pick it we do nothing with the

219
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:59,919
current and we're picking next number i

220
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,639
plus one index when we pick it

221
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:05,919
we need to append this current

222
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,360
num nums i to the current set and then

223
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,639
move to the next

224
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,319
number right

225
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,560
and when we reach the end this is the

226
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,879
termination of the recursion when we

227
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,599
reach the end we just put the current

228
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:20,479
into the answer into the answer okay

229
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:23,440
a little bit okay no b yeah the time

230
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:25,599
complexity for this one obviously

231
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,199
two to the power and because they have

232
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,120
the number of

233
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,520
the total number of the

234
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,599
subset is 2 to the power okay

235
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,080
okay so this is one way of doing it

236
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,640
tomorrow we're going to talk about using

237
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,320
another one which is called b masking

238
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,320
and the day after tomorrow we're going

239
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,600
to talk about another agreement to solve

240
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:48,880
this is called cascading okay cascading

241
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:51,279
so lastly and then daddy then that'll be

242
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:54,279
okay that's it for today bye-bye

243
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,279
bye-bye
