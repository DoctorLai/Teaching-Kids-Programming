1
00:00:03,319 --> 00:00:11,700
okay so let's look at these numbers two

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:14,759
for a 6 okay so we are given a list of

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:17,400
integers positive integers and we want

4
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:20,039
to find out the product of it right so

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,720
we Transit together what's for that I

6
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,939
can't do numbers together

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:30,599
for that this is a way I we've given

8
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:30,599
this which is 64 times 16. 1024

9
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:42,120
that's right for example like this 1024

10
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:45,180
can be represented as 2 to the power of

11
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:48,660
10 right okay this is the plan Point

12
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:51,420
number so we want to find out that this

13
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:53,520
thing number of the prime number

14
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,719
right which is two so you return one

15
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,719
let's take another example

16
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,960
two

17
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,719
four three it doesn't have to be

18
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,019
ascending order okay what's the answer

19
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:06,019
here

20
00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:14,060
one six eight

21
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,060
so what's this number is it

22
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:26,640
okay so 168 equals two to the power of

23
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:28,380
three times three seven is it so how

24
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,700
many numbers one two three so we'll

25
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,500
return three numbers

26
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,500
okay so what's your thoughts about

27
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:37,700
solving this problem Oh yes do the math

28
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,700
the two times four

29
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,840
times yes

30
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:48,119
you want to calculate all the numbers

31
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:50,159
with the products okay and then okay so

32
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:52,259
once we have this number so what do we

33
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,659
do yeah we give them no no I don't know

34
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:57,479
what we do what do you call this process

35
00:01:54,659 --> 00:02:00,899
one six a becomes that that we call it

36
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:00,899
uh factorization

37
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:08,520
if I get to the power of three

38
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:10,380
two to the power of three why each

39
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:14,160
integer yes so that's a good question

40
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:17,459
each integer can be represented as P1 a

41
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,860
p two B times together okay so this P

42
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:21,959
are the prime numbers ABC this is

43
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:24,060
non-negative integers why is it two to

44
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:25,920
the power three two this is already a

45
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:29,400
point number two to the power one this

46
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:32,520
12. is 2 to the power of 2 2 to the

47
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:35,400
power 1 to 2 to the power 2 equals 2 to

48
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:37,379
the power 6 okay and three and seven is

49
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,900
already a prime number we can convert

50
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:42,239
integer back to this format right we

51
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,580
call it the factorization okay your

52
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,800
solution is that we find out the product

53
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:50,040
and then we do this process right to

54
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,599
this person so 168 we just try if it can

55
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,560
be divided by the first prime number

56
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:57,239
which is two if it can then

57
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,660
168 divided by two

58
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:04,379
this is 2 times 84. 84 can be divided by

59
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:08,160
2. so this is equal 42.

60
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:09,000
times 2 right 42 can be again divided by

61
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,640
two

62
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,800
is two times twenty one right okay so

63
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,840
look how many two three

64
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,760
okay so what's the next number because

65
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,500
it can't be divided by two again so

66
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,819
what's next Point number which is three

67
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,819
right so 21.

68
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:33,659
make sense okay so okay so one question

69
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:36,480
this number could be very big do we have

70
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:39,599
to do we have to to find out a product

71
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,519
know no right we don't have to put oh

72
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,500
what why would you ask that we are given

73
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,180
this array right we don't need to

74
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,819
multiply it together we just have to

75
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,799
find out the factorization of this

76
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:53,040
number and this number this number this

77
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:55,379
number and then we find our owner this P

78
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,420
listing prime factors and put it in the

79
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:59,700
set then we count the number of the

80
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:02,580
distinct because set Only Stores the

81
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:04,379
unique uh numbers and right yes

82
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:07,080
doesn't make sense okay so let's repeat

83
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:11,340
this process okay let's take a look at a

84
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:12,420
more complex example two four nine eight

85
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,659
ten

86
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:17,160
a okay so one approach we also is

87
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:18,959
something together and do this person

88
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,359
right but this number could be very big

89
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,060
so how do we do it look these two

90
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,139
to the power one this four two to the

91
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:29,100
power of two

92
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:31,919
this nine three to the power of two

93
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:35,699
10 2 times 5 right

94
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:38,040
a two to the power C okay so we just

95
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:42,780
look at this number how many twos one

96
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:45,060
one one one okay that's two that's three

97
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:47,280
and that's five so we'll return three

98
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:49,199
doesn't make sense our task is to

99
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,000
multiply together right we multiply it

100
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,620
together we're still doing the same

101
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,680
process right so we don't have to

102
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:57,360
multiply does it make sense okay so if

103
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,860
we multiply it

104
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,180
what's the number

105
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,300
hey

106
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:06,240
72

107
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:08,699
320 times a right times a that could be

108
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,699
I don't know you know but once you get

109
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:13,560
this number you do this reverse right

110
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:14,479
you don't need this verse

111
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,940
yeah

112
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:19,919
so I'm already missing number eventually

113
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:21,960
you're going backwards right so there's

114
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,419
no point to multiply because we already

115
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:28,620
know what numbers comprise of it right

116
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:32,000
okay it's five seven six zero five seven

117
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:35,759
six zero okay so this number is 2 times

118
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,300
again this number two times one for

119
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,300
foreign

120
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:49,979
obviously

121
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,479
talk about how to improve it

122
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:54,000
and we're going to talk about the

123
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:56,220
Improvement in the next lesson okay be

124
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,320
fine let's say F function only given

125
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:00,960
these numbers we put all the prime

126
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,759
factors in the set right

127
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,860
we put all the prime factors in the same

128
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:06,479
let's say a equals set it's a data

129
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:10,979
structure yeah what's the difference

130
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:13,740
between a set and uh array is everyone

131
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:15,660
I said what was that stores are unique

132
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,039
it's a hash Table Restaurant unique

133
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:19,800
number right we want to find out the

134
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,780
number of distinct factors okay yeah it

135
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:25,100
doesn't make sense right

136
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:28,319
because of each number X in numbers

137
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:33,120
first prime number let's say is 2y P

138
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:34,440
equals two wire X not equal one

139
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,900
wire

140
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:41,580
X can be divided by the p

141
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:44,100
then we put this point number in the

142
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,880
headstep right this is the headset and

143
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,940
then

144
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:50,160
x divided by P right so this is

145
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:53,460
basically saying that if this number if

146
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,660
if this current number can be divided by

147
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:57,180
P

148
00:06:54,660 --> 00:07:00,539
which is the point number then we keep

149
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:02,220
dividing it right okay and if we can't

150
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:05,460
divide it by a letter we try the next

151
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:08,880
Point number P E plus equal one okay and

152
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:11,940
okay we try the next number then return

153
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:15,180
the length of a

154
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:17,580
Can you spot the knees you know problems

155
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:19,080
here or any questions here so far okay

156
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:21,060
I'm telling you this is the prime number

157
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:25,199
right this is

158
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:27,000
and if this number is not one then we

159
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,340
check it can be divided by this prime

160
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,080
number and we keep dividing it and I

161
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:33,240
will put this P into the set because

162
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:36,000
this set it stores the unique numbers

163
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,680
right unique number so we finally return

164
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,740
the length of the set which is the

165
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:43,020
listing number right okay so any

166
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:46,880
problems here any questions I mean it's

167
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,880
not a problem but any questions so far

168
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:53,520
[Laughter]

169
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,740
prime number

170
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,259
why is it plus one here

171
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:00,240
second plus one season prime number so

172
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:02,520
next prime if you find next prime number

173
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,160
first one is the next phone number no

174
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:07,440
okay so that's the problem okay U plus

175
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,900
one is not the next one number right

176
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,599
yeah because two what's the next three

177
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:16,080
what's the next four right do we need to

178
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:19,379
check the four no right five right

179
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,120
so because of this P we try to let it

180
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:22,680
represent the prime number but here we

181
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,120
just plus one now this approach still

182
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,160
works because it just you know keep

183
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,319
doing two three four five it's just

184
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,860
doing some useless work when it's coming

185
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:34,620
to four coming to six because look

186
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:36,419
when P equals four there is no point to

187
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:38,219
do this right there is no point to do

188
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:41,159
this

189
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:43,080
when P equals six there is no point hey

190
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:45,660
no point why is that because one p

191
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,700
equals two it's already checking if it

192
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:49,440
can be divided by two and then if it can

193
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:52,380
be there divided by two it would just

194
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,700
repeatedly divide it right so when it

195
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,980
gets to the four there's no point right

196
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:59,640
it doesn't make sense yeah

197
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:01,980
okay so let's take an example a

198
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:04,680
so look it comes to this you can divide

199
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:07,440
it by two four divided by two two

200
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:09,120
divided by two one right when it reaches

201
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,880
one that's it how do we find all the

202
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:15,120
prime numbers under 100. you just

203
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,920
basically one two check it every time

204
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,320
table and then cross it out yeah that's

205
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,700
diagonal I'm talking about one two why I

206
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,240
don't know the name right

207
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,240
okay

208
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,240
okay suppose uh this is a hundred so

209
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,120
first of all one is not prime number

210
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,580
because okay okay two

211
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,660
two is the prime number because without

212
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,660
the multiples

213
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:45,120
okay nice one three because of the

214
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,200
multiples six already because of nine

215
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,420
right

216
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:51,180
Etc five E three and the remaining is

217
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:52,980
the prime number right yeah okay so this

218
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:55,860
is similar idea okay this is the similar

219
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:58,620
idea right yeah but yeah when you take

220
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:00,899
three you're gonna check six which is

221
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,580
already that's right one is closer it's

222
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:03,959
close up right a number cannot be

223
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:07,040
crossed out twice

224
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:10,140
yeah I'm saying yeah

225
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:12,420
yeah I know but this is still the the

226
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:15,300
most efficient experience to find all

227
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:17,339
the prime numbers uh under the ranger

228
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:19,620
given a range okay so one Improvement

229
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:22,980
you can imagine is that instead of P

230
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:25,500
right so how about if I can get the

231
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:28,320
equivalent so if we calculate the prime

232
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:30,540
numbers if these numbers are given a

233
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,940
range is smaller than a thousand right

234
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:34,620
so if all the numbers are smaller than a

235
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,720
thousand and we find out all the prime

236
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:39,779
numbers under a thousand and instead of

237
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:43,019
incrementing one we just get the next

238
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:45,120
prime number does it make sense yeah so

239
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:47,160
instead of p p equals to what's the next

240
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,560
number here P plus equal one that's not

241
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,839
very efficient we say get me the next

242
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:54,120
prime number which is three get me in

243
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,920
the next one number which is fine get me

244
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,420
in the next prime number seven and

245
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,360
what's the next number

246
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:02,399
phone number eleven eleven yes instead

247
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:05,040
of plus one you can get this right okay

248
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:07,200
okay so what have you learned today

249
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,360
we want to find out that this thing

250
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,700
prime factors of the product of the

251
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:15,600
array so we need to find out the product

252
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:18,019
of an array no why because we could just

253
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,820
you could just count

254
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:23,940
if you could divide the by T each number

255
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:26,640
and then count five numbers are in that

256
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:29,399
thingy and then return how much numbers

257
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:31,500
are in that you counted okay so we want

258
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:34,519
to find out this thing so how do we find

259
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,519
out that this thing here

260
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:41,300
suppose a unique number okay so for

261
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:41,300
example like a equals

262
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:49,260
one a DOT add two a DOT add three three

263
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:51,060
three okay what's the length of a adding

264
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:53,220
one adding to adding three adding three

265
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:56,519
adding three what's the length of the a

266
00:11:53,220 --> 00:12:01,019
the set stores the unique numbers one

267
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:02,700
two three three one three okay a equals

268
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:04,740
at least

269
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:07,380
a DOT a pen

270
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:09,540
one a DOT ten two a DOT ten three three

271
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:12,240
three what's the length of number of a

272
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:14,100
how many elements in a one two three

273
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:18,380
three how many elements do you know five

274
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,380
five okay so if I change this to set

275
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:23,579
only three right because one two three

276
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,380
three is a duplicate it doesn't go in

277
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:28,260
three is there another deal okay going

278
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:31,980
make sense yes yeah okay that's it for

279
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:31,980
today bye bye bye
