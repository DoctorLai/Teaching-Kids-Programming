1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:05,680
hello

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,560
hello mr mr ryan okay so what's this

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,559
uh

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,120
we have learned this before yeah do we

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,880
have it michael beat yeah so this is

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,639
actually a very useful

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,600
very powerful

8
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,880
device little device okay yeah

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,439
yeah

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:25,039
okay so it's it's like this one this one

11
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:28,400
look yeah this one it's a it's tiny it's

12
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:30,720
a tiny and they say how many dots on it

13
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,440
twenty-five five rows five columns yeah

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,840
it's a it's a little device by bbc if

15
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,880
you look at it it says bbc micro bit

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,160
okay

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,879
this is the

18
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,280
uh emulator so

19
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:46,000
so you see on the left swing yeah this

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,399
is kind of this little version on the on

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,640
the computer so you can see how

22
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,960
uh the code works okay

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,360
so we have a bunch of tools here the

24
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,160
basic input these these are very useful

25
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,719
that

26
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:02,239
you know it allows us to just drag and

27
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:05,119
drop you know with this

28
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:07,760
drag and drop the

29
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,920
the the stuff yeah the stuff the logic

30
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,119
to the this is the code area which i

31
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,040
choose python uh you know previously we

32
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,600
learned about javascript yeah the person

33
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,200
we have learned python all these days so

34
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,200
let's just try to use the price so how

35
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,240
to prove how uh to show how it works

36
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,360
let's say

37
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,280
we we can just do this let's say basic

38
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,560
dot show string

39
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,640
and let's just

40
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,000
print basic is module and that's your

41
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,520
string hello

42
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,079
yeah so if we click on this

43
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,040
then you will have this hello yeah

44
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,000
got it

45
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,280
yeah okay so i have got this little

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,759
device here

47
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,880
it's connected to my usb

48
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:51,520
yeah but then i i can

49
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,280
look this is the code yeah which is just

50
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,640
one that shows hello and then if you

51
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,240
look at here

52
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,520
uh

53
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,280
okay so should i please die

54
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,640
hello

55
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,560
okay hello yeah if you see hello yeah

56
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,679
and then you prove that it works all

57
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:12,160
right in this in this simulator then we

58
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,080
can download it it's pink yeah we can

59
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,319
download it yeah he asks us to pair well

60
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,680
that's fine we just download the file

61
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,400
download down

62
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,640
and then we can just drag and drop these

63
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,319
files to the usb

64
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,120
micro bit

65
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,879
yeah and then it's it's downloading to

66
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,400
the little device microphone here i

67
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,160
can't see it yeah they can't see because

68
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,239
i'm not showing that window but it's

69
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,319
just a window to show the trends

70
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,879
downloading to the microphone okay and

71
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,080
that's it and you see hello hello yeah

72
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,599
you see hello

73
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,280
yeah

74
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,840
yeah

75
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,440
this is it yeah this is it okay so

76
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,560
that's how we get

77
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,959
write the code test it on computer on

78
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,480
this uh screen and then once everything

79
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,640
is okay we download it here and then we

80
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:01,120
can play yeah you might also see this

81
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:03,680
there are two buttons pizza yeah two two

82
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,680
two buttons these are

83
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,840
pizza which is just right then you have

84
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,720
to catch them yeah when you press a you

85
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,280
go left and b you go right okay yeah

86
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,840
normally we do it like that okay okay

87
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,360
yeah yeah we did it maybe we can we can

88
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,720
do it tomorrow okay we can do it

89
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,599
tomorrow look look

90
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,840
these this is the screen which is output

91
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:26,159
and a and b is the input and there are a

92
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,400
few pins yeah which you we don't have to

93
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,560
worry about you know these these pins

94
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,280
are connected to the hardware you know

95
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,080
some other hardware but all we care now

96
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,840
is a b this is the input two buttons

97
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,360
which we can see

98
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,760
it's an input yeah you can use as a

99
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,640
joystick controller and then this is a

100
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,319
screen and then if you can connect

101
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,400
with this pin sometimes you can connect

102
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:51,360
to a speaker and you can connect to a

103
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,680
camera right yeah connect to a sensor

104
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,680
etc okay so let's do something

105
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,239
useful for example if i want to say

106
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,640
press a then we want to show the

107
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,879
character a and press b we want to show

108
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,439
the character b on the screen that look

109
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,879
here we have the input look here yeah

110
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,120
and then here it says

111
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:11,599
run code on button

112
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,360
pressed and now we can just drag and

113
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:16,000
drag here yeah you see and this is the

114
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,239
curve you just generalize that on button

115
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,919
is it defined yeah we need there python

116
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,160
yeah input

117
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,680
button press button a on button press

118
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,320
now we can say

119
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,120
basic dot show

120
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,639
show show string

121
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,120
a okay

122
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,120
and then similarly similarly

123
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,680
similarly what do we do we can just

124
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,000
press do another copy and paste

125
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,560
and then we can say on button b

126
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,600
and then here on button b yeah

127
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,600
and here on button b

128
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,560
okay and then we can here it's nothing

129
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,440
yeah but look press a

130
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,759
a

131
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,680
press b b

132
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,199
yeah do you see they look we define two

133
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,000
functions

134
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:02,720
button a and button b button a

135
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,080
actual button show a button b should be

136
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,240
input on button pressed looking event

137
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,039
tells us what is this function for you

138
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,600
do something when a button a b oppose a

139
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,680
plus b is cross down and release again

140
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,919
so okay this is very interesting you can

141
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,240
you can control when two buttons are

142
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:23,120
pressed together yeah yeah okay

143
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:26,320
so so look if i if i download it to that

144
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,880
to here then you'll be this you'll be

145
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,720
working here you yeah

146
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,600
okay so

147
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,160
yeah

148
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,720
do you get it now yeah look these are a

149
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,320
few more interesting things

150
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,080
don't worry about this math because we

151
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,840
learned about this programming python we

152
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,800
can just do all this math stuff yeah

153
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,720
logic yeah logic if else yeah this is

154
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,360
quite simple to you right yeah we know

155
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,240
the python if if statement yeah the mass

156
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,600
yeah plus minus multiple divide this is

157
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,160
basic yeah

158
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:59,039
arrays here we talk about arrays so so

159
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,880
these just are useful you know for kids

160
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,120
yeah but not for you right yeah because

161
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,600
you learn a lot right yeah got it okay

162
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,400
your kids are as well okay and show test

163
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,840
yeah it's your test this is easy

164
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,400
okay the other thing we want to talk

165
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:16,639
about is ldd so how do we control this

166
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,400
little dot 525 on the screen so we have

167
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,520
this led

168
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,720
dot plot okay this is unplugged actually

169
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,600
dot plot

170
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,840
plot so if plot zero zero is the first

171
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,199
stop so if i do that then the first

172
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,160
first dot

173
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:35,919
yeah it's turned on yeah okay

174
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,520
all right let's try plus one zero so

175
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:40,400
look x y

176
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:43,280
so x y x is horizontal y is vertical so

177
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,520
x y so you'll be brought the two dots

178
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,080
yeah okay

179
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,720
do you get it yeah okay so now we have

180
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,599
another one called unplot so let's say

181
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,479
we want to unplug the aed.unplot and

182
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,000
plot

183
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,479
one zero

184
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,800
so actually you only show

185
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,960
one dot right because the second dot is

186
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,120
plotted and then we unplot it

187
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,520
immediately so we can't see it turn on

188
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,199
right so we see this this is actually

189
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,680
very useful

190
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:14,319
so we can control it so how let's say we

191
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,680
want to control a dot

192
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,599
okay a dot

193
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,840
going from left to the right up to the

194
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,720
down and then we when it goes to the

195
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,479
bottom

196
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,720
and you go back to the first one right

197
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:27,759
so how do we do it let's say x equals

198
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,560
zero y equals zero right

199
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,479
yeah so we have something here which is

200
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,319
called control

201
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,240
uh

202
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,919
one code uh

203
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,199
do we see one code

204
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,560
every

205
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,560
a few seconds or probably where is it

206
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,280
once probably a once i know

207
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,400
no

208
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:51,280
uh loops no loops oh run code every

209
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:54,639
interval okay so this is useful let's

210
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:57,280
just put it here look every interval 500

211
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,360
let's put it as 200 milliseconds on

212
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,039
every interval so let's say

213
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,919
global x

214
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,599
y okay so this is to allow us to control

215
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,080
these two variables so what do we want

216
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:10,400
to do first of all we want to plot

217
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,840
for the location right after the

218
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,840
location now we want to

219
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,039
actually let's unplot it first and then

220
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:22,160
we want to x plus

221
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:24,319
x is horizontal yeah x plus equals x

222
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,919
plus equals one

223
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:30,000
then if it goes to the right so if x

224
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:33,760
equal equal

225
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,919
0 1 2 3 4 5 if it equals 5 it means that

226
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,880
it's beyond the screen it's on the right

227
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:41,919
hand side so what we want to set is x

228
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:44,480
equals 1 then y needs to plus equals 1

229
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:48,000
right because going down right then if y

230
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:50,160
equals 5 again then y means to go back

231
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,160
to

232
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,760
what go back to the zero right

233
00:08:52,480 --> 00:09:00,320
and then we need to plot it again

234
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,320
right all right let's see how it goes

235
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:07,040
it's not quite right okay so either f1

236
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:09,920
is not functional this is weird okay so

237
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:12,000
led plot okay

238
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,640
yeah yeah that's a problem i i have no

239
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,880
idea at the moment x plus equals one if

240
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,480
x equal equal five

241
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,040
means that x s

242
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,760
x is on the right hand side on here

243
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,160
right just right here then x equals to 1

244
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,080
now y needs to plus equals 1 y needs to

245
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:31,200
move to the next row

246
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:35,760
right and then if y equals 5

247
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:38,800
y equals 5 0 1 2 3 4 5 and y 2 equals

248
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,920
zero it seems all right then a d plot x

249
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,800
y

250
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,720
uh

251
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,320
what does it say why it says e is not

252
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,320
either fn is not a function

253
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,839
uh

254
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:54,080
no idea so

255
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:58,080
what does it say

256
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,080
what does he say why it says e dot fn

257
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:03,279
uh

258
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,200
on every interval

259
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,519
so let's say what's that what's the

260
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,600
perimeter of the second one okay right

261
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,279
now you're here

262
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,880
okay what does it say

263
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:17,360
interval number

264
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:20,079
to weight in repeat okay so is 200

265
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,079
and then the function which is the on

266
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:27,120
every interval okay that seems all right

267
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:28,000
right so unplugged aed and plot x y

268
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,480
and

269
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,399
x plus equals one okay so is there a

270
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,839
problem with this one x

271
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,480
ah x

272
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,800
x equals one okay so that's the problem

273
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:42,720
if x equals one

274
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:45,760
if x equals five x equals one

275
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,920
y plus equals one if y equals five no y

276
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,600
equals 0

277
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,200
then we plot it

278
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,399
i don't see an error do you see an error

279
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,760
here

280
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,720
let me just

281
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,959
maybe just refresh the screen

282
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,399
probably

283
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:03,920
refresh the string to make it better

284
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,720
yeah okay so

285
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:09,200
uh you see it's moving but why is it

286
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,760
staying on the

287
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,760
on here

288
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,880
is it x equal one ah that's right wow

289
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,279
that's very good

290
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,320
good catch oh yeah you see then

291
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,560
yeah

292
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,560
okay

293
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,959
okay so you see that's how we control

294
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,040
the bits yeah and then send it okay

295
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,160
let's download it download it

296
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,320
downloading

297
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,800
download it uh

298
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:40,240
okay and i'm going to wait

299
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,959
i'm going to drag this to my copy

300
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,120
and then you ask me to confirm wait wait

301
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:49,440
no you know you know you know you know

302
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:53,440
no yeah okay wait 17 completed

303
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:56,320
17 completely 60 85 okay

304
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,600
you see the dots you see

305
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,880
yeah

306
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,720
okay

307
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,600
okay got it

308
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:06,720
do you understand wow that's a very good

309
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,399
uh spot okay this one but you get a

310
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,240
point yeah

311
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,160
variables yeah we have talked about the

312
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,200
variables here at this here

313
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,839
the mass okay radius radius we don't

314
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,800
have radius you know at the moment

315
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:23,440
in in order to use the radius we need to

316
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,399
plug these into some special radar

317
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,320
devices

318
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,079
hey this is the thing we talk about we

319
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,160
actually can actually

320
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:34,560
change the brightness okay change how

321
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:36,480
how brightness this finger dot is yeah

322
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,279
okay make sense

323
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,440
okay so let's say we

324
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,399
what else can you do with this thing

325
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,880
single

326
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,000
device with 25 peaks what can you do

327
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,510
just like

328
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,399
okay

329
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:50,079
[Music]

330
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,000
okay but let's that's a big problem

331
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,920
let's wait until tomorrow yeah yeah

332
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,440
apple catching yeah easy

333
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,360
but have you have it oh yeah it's

334
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,680
interesting for today yeah

335
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,160
okay that's it that's it say bye bye say

336
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:05,480
bye bye bye

337
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,480
bye bye
