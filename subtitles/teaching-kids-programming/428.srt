1
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:17,600
yeah okay so this is the final tree

2
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,600
yeah final three this is one three by

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,800
the way final three yeah two final means

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,600
two one kid one parent can have almost

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,080
two

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,560
yeah and that is not which doesn't have

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,760
any kids we call it leaves at least one

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,600
doesn't have parents we call it

9
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,200
how many um

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,670
parents can

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,879
not have

12
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:40,800
[Music]

13
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,960
how many parents

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,399
one yeah and most one yeah this one

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,440
doesn't have parent it's called load

16
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:50,160
okay at least one so either

17
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,320
for a binary if it's you know if it has

18
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,360
zero or two

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,640
two kids we call it um complete final

20
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,520
three okay complete financing yay

21
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,480
okay

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,280
complete

23
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,320
okay so so let's see this one is this

24
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,360
complete

25
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:10,080
it's least complete yeah one three six

26
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:13,600
is this completely balancing um no but

27
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:16,799
it has a hole yeah okay and if we put

28
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,280
complete this hole it's also a

29
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,080
perfect financing because because every

30
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,840
every level is yeah every level is

31
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,479
completed and it's called perfect

32
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,320
biology okay so if i stand from the left

33
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,880
hand side looking from the right yeah we

34
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,720
talk about this on day 92 yeah so what

35
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,280
can we see

36
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,640
you can see one two and four okay if we

37
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,960
stand from the right hand side looking

38
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,040
at front to the left

39
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,439
okay and then if i put in another one

40
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,600
hey what can we see

41
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,560
in both sides

42
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,159
so that will be one two four eight and

43
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,159
here will be

44
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:56,960
one

45
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:59,920
three six a right yeah easy yeah is it

46
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,600
yeah yeah okay so

47
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,920
we talked about buying a breakfast

48
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,920
search yeah breakfast travel level by

49
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,600
level what's that what's the

50
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,560
best research

51
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,440
order

52
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:14,480
for this binary um one two three four

53
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:17,040
five seven six eight yeah okay how about

54
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,239
the deficits we if we go for the left

55
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,640
hand side

56
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,879
if we travel the left subtree first and

57
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,360
then root and the right subtree we what

58
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,400
we call it in order right this is in

59
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,959
order

60
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,760
left node right in order

61
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,360
oh

62
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,040
you know for the different search we can

63
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,519
have different order yeah we can have

64
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,840
this node left right or

65
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,560
left and right no okay so this is

66
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,720
preorder this is in order this is first

67
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,400
order one one good way to remember this

68
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,840
come on one good way to remember this we

69
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,599
just check this

70
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,440
n which is the loop

71
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,920
yeah where is it it's in the middle we

72
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,840
call it in order

73
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,480
in the first one we call it pre-order in

74
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,360
the middle we call it inorder you know

75
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:02,239
last we call it post order right so i

76
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,239
can't remember

77
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,920
look at this one and it's in the

78
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,879
last so it's post in the first one keep

79
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,480
on thinking like the last one is green

80
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,879
uh-huh okay

81
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,280
in this one in the pre okay so sometimes

82
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,360
we go also called reversed you know we

83
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,640
can do it reverse for example reverse in

84
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,879
order would be r and air yeah

85
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,760
the reverse uh

86
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:32,480
reverse preorder will be r uh

87
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,480
ln and rf and then reverse

88
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,680
okay

89
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,920
so look if we do this step for that

90
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,159
because you know differences what do we

91
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,680
get for the recursion

92
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,920
uh pre-order

93
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:52,080
one two four

94
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,280
five three seven eight six yeah yeah

95
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,560
how about

96
00:03:53,280 --> 00:04:00,760
how about a post order

97
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,760
how about a post order um

98
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,519
four

99
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,840
five okay well what did we talk about

100
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,959
one two three this is copy over sorry

101
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,239
yeah this is

102
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,879
one two three four okay for first order

103
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,840
i think we are talking about

104
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,519
this one right so it is what

105
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,199
four five

106
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,000
two

107
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,960
eight

108
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,840
seven

109
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,400
six three one one yeah exactly

110
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,560
okay

111
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,800
so for the preference search we use the

112
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,560
queue right so we put in the queue for

113
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,160
the test method you will use the stack

114
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,919
you know most of the cases we use the

115
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,840
recursion which is uh faster to

116
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,560
implement okay so i'm going to enter in

117
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,040
the preferences first define let's say

118
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,120
you know it depends on left or right

119
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,440
let's just say view like view of the

120
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,000
tree view of a tree

121
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,240
and then we have a root

122
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,280
and first of all answer yeah answer

123
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,919
equals

124
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,479
an empty list yeah empty list

125
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:04,240
so if not root

126
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,240
we just return yeah we can answer

127
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,360
this is a special case we have to handle

128
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,880
yeah

129
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:13,440
so now let's say put it in the queue

130
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,680
q equals how do we implement how do we

131
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,320
use the cube

132
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,320
double nd

133
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,479
thank you

134
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,720
so what do we need to put in

135
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,520
here

136
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,800
we put the loot we put a note in the

137
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,639
queue and when we dequeue it yeah dq

138
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,600
means that take the element out of a

139
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,600
queue yeah pop it from the other topic

140
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,600
from front right first thing first out

141
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,600
yeah first things first up so we need to

142
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,240
put put the kids in right

143
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,120
look how can you go through this with me

144
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,720
come on

145
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:53,639
can you go through this with me how can

146
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,639
we this is answer yeah answer

147
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,240
yeah i put a one here yeah

148
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,720
this is one so i take it out

149
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,840
so i take it off right i take it now i

150
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,280
need to put it in the answer yeah

151
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,160
because this is the first time right

152
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,120
yeah

153
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,680
okay

154
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,160
now what happened one has the

155
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,199
the kids two and three

156
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,720
yeah so which two should i put a two or

157
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,520
three depending on

158
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,759
which

159
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,720
which side i'm standing at is from left

160
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,720
and right

161
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,520
let's say i want to

162
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,310
first i want to get the left left left

163
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,440
side view yeah

164
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:31,360
[Music]

165
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,199
so i need to put a 2 in right come on

166
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,919
look at me

167
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,720
i put a two

168
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,960
yeah

169
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,800
but i have to put it in a queue two and

170
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,280
three in here

171
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,360
and i take the two out

172
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,280
i take the two out i put the kids four

173
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,199
and five

174
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,000
but four

175
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,880
well four is this is the left hand side

176
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,639
wheel so i put it here right

177
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,039
and then three i think you know i don't

178
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,639
do anything before i take it out i don't

179
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,560
it doesn't have any kit five doesn't

180
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,520
have a kit okay

181
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,199
yeah

182
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,560
so but

183
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,560
but if i

184
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,840
want to do this twice right side view

185
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,840
the only difference is that

186
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,680
the kit

187
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,560
instead of the first kit i take the last

188
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,919
kid

189
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,240
right

190
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,240
yeah all right

191
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,360
this makes sense yeah

192
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,120
so why

193
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,280
why are q

194
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,199
so

195
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:32,319
first of all first of all i need to take

196
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:34,080
it out karen

197
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:37,199
actually no actually

198
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,199
actually what do i need to do n equals

199
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,599
the length of a q

200
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,960
this is the com this is the number of

201
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,840
the

202
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,479
kids

203
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,479
number of the notes in the next layer

204
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,639
yeah in the next level

205
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:54,960
and yeah

206
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:56,720
okay so now i answer the append

207
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,120
append

208
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:02,560
q zero

209
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:05,680
if it's uh if you want to retrieve the

210
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,400
the first note or q minus one which is

211
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,280
the last note yeah and then for

212
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,720
i

213
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,240
in range invent

214
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,560
and

215
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,560
if

216
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,960
q

217
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,039
i

218
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,840
yeah q i don't left if it has the left

219
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:28,000
kids and then we put the kid in here all

220
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,000
right

221
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,279
q uh

222
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:36,000
q dot append

223
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,800
actually we can do this x equals q dot

224
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,959
pot

225
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:42,240
pop left okay

226
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,240
yeah kill the pop left

227
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,240
and then if x to the left

228
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:53,839
kill the opponent extra left

229
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,839
and if x don't write

230
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:06,320
[Music]

231
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,480
okay let me go through this again okay i

232
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,600
think this is the little bit

233
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,600
the problem here

234
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,440
okay so

235
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,000
depending here depending on

236
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,240
from left or right q0 means from the

237
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,680
left q minus one

238
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,120
meaning

239
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,320
we want to

240
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,399
take the right side view right side view

241
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,240
this is just the very standard graphics

242
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,040
search with a search

243
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,320
now n equals lens cube n is the number

244
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,320
of the

245
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:48,560
n is the number of the

246
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:51,680
what of the notes in the next layer yeah

247
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:54,399
so we can append q dot

248
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,839
we can append either the leftmost or the

249
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,399
rightmost

250
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:01,760
kit with the uh to the

251
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:03,120
to the to the view yeah to the answer

252
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,360
then

253
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:08,160
every time we we can secure we can take

254
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,720
all the kids on the same level

255
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,560
top them out and then push their kids

256
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,360
back to the cube yeah

257
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:18,320
so another way of doing is this look if

258
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,240
we we can we can do this inside but here

259
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,200
we have to check if

260
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,000
if if i is 0

261
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,480
or

262
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,120
if i is

263
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:32,160
if i is the n minus 1 right depending on

264
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,480
where so inside this inside this we can

265
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,640
check if it's if the index is the first

266
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,920
one or the last one yeah this also works

267
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,680
okay

268
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,680
yeah

269
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,440
make sense

270
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,839
okay so buffer search

271
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,279
okay now let's go back to the test step

272
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,240
research

273
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,959
so

274
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,079
how

275
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,640
how do we

276
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:54,170
how do we use the definitions to

277
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,240
to solve this problem

278
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:58,160
[Music]

279
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,920
okay i'm going to show you here

280
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,040
temperature is a little bit different

281
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,640
okay

282
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,600
one

283
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,800
two

284
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,160
three

285
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,120
four

286
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,640
five

287
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,000
six

288
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,959
okay

289
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,880
for the definition

290
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,040
when we're traveling with this

291
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,079
what what information do we need

292
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,519
to

293
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:23,040
to you know

294
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,640
what information do we need we need to

295
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,880
you know

296
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:30,000
when it's a lot

297
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:32,959
yeah it's something like that yes

298
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,360
yes okay so depending if we want to go

299
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:39,839
to the left left side view yeah so we do

300
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:42,959
this pre-order so every time we go to an

301
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:45,360
we go to a new level so obviously we

302
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:48,079
need when we define this deficit before

303
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,519
dms we have this loot and we need to

304
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,440
pass the level

305
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:54,000
and the beginning is here

306
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,480
right so when we pass down the tree

307
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,560
we go to the left the level plus equals

308
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,000
one we go to the right the level plus

309
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,519
equals one right

310
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,160
yeah but we need to store these stories

311
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:08,240
in uh this january right

312
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,880
the first time we depending on

313
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,040
on if we want to do this left side or

314
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:17,440
right side view if it's on the left side

315
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:19,760
view we want to update like that

316
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,600
the the key it will be the level yeah

317
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,040
key will be level and the value will be

318
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,360
the

319
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,760
the the the note right

320
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,560
so it depends if it's the left side view

321
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,560
the first time we visit a level we

322
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,639
remember it but we don't and then the

323
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,760
subsequent visit we don't update the

324
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,920
value right

325
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,560
and if we want to go to the uh do the

326
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,880
right side view we always update it with

327
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:46,079
the pre-order right all alternatively we

328
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,839
can swap the pre-order pre-order is this

329
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,519
one yeah the

330
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,320
one two

331
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,959
four you see you see how i go one two

332
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,360
four right so i do the different search

333
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:59,279
with one two four so this is the exactly

334
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,360
the left side view right but for the

335
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,959
right side view it's it's not right for

336
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,720
the right side view i need to do this

337
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,639
one three

338
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,600
on the other side oh i can do it one two

339
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,959
three three one of these is this yeah

340
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,800
one two

341
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,399
four

342
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,279
one two four

343
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,600
and then

344
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:19,839
five six three

345
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,600
yeah if i want to use this sequence to

346
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,279
do the right side view which is one

347
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,639
three five six

348
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,480
you see

349
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:29,440
one

350
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,720
three five six you see

351
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,200
okay

352
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,680
so how do we do that we use a dictionary

353
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,360
yeah we use the dictionary

354
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,480
so uh

355
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:43,360
so if not loot obviously we just return

356
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,360
we don't do anything

357
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,079
yeah depending on what we do load the

358
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,760
left

359
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:53,760
yeah do the left level plus one

360
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,680
right and then now i visit these three

361
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,680
so i can do what i can

362
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,959
here this is the code if i have this

363
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,440
data here

364
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:04,240
data is a dictionary dictionary default

365
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,240
additional area

366
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,399
default additional which is the integer

367
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,680
the value default type will be integer

368
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:15,199
the level

369
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:18,480
so then i can do this data

370
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:20,000
data level yeah level

371
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,519
equals

372
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,079
load

373
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:27,839
double value and then i can do

374
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,839
i can travel the right tree

375
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:34,480
level plus one right when we go go down

376
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:36,639
the tree in the next level we have uh

377
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,560
we have to update the level right

378
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,399
because look this is that was yellow

379
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,560
level one level two

380
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,800
when i travel the left tree

381
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,320
plus one well i'll travel like three i

382
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,079
plus one

383
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,000
yeah so once i

384
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:52,880
do this once i

385
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,880
do this dfs load i give a beginning

386
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,560
level which is zero

387
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,600
then

388
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,199
here

389
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,160
here

390
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:05,440
okay then you tell me if i do this

391
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:08,880
the data level will be the left side

392
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,079
view or right side view choose one

393
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,760
right

394
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:14,560
yeah why is right

395
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,560
why why is that

396
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,120
what we're looking for

397
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,480
[Music]

398
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,519
good answer that's what we're looking

399
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:24,480
for because we keep updating

400
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,480
we keep updating

401
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,680
one

402
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,279
two three okay so this let's take this

403
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,519
example one two three what happened

404
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:36,240
what's the sequence

405
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:38,320
one three two three right

406
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,800
okay so the the order of which is the

407
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,720
note is one two three so the order of

408
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,839
the look there are two nodes and number

409
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,360
one right

410
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:51,120
so data level one equals two

411
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:53,680
and then data level one equals three

412
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:58,160
so what's the data number one what's the

413
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,160
data number one here and at this point

414
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,279
we are updating when we traversing using

415
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,000
default search we're updating the date

416
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:09,199
like dictionary the level the key is the

417
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,920
level okay so listen to me here

418
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:14,320
data one two three so what's the data

419
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,959
one what's the what's the final value of

420
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,959
data one

421
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:24,480
three yes three because look we first of

422
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,920
all theta one equals two but we

423
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,720
visit the tree

424
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,959
in the pre-order so it means the three

425
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,240
gets visited

426
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:35,040
last

427
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:38,320
so what does it mean it means the last

428
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:40,160
the last val node visited will be

429
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,920
updated will be used as the right side

430
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,199
view right yeah

431
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,279
yeah

432
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:47,199
if we want to do this opposite so we

433
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,720
need to swap these two right we visit

434
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:51,040
the right tree first and we reach the

435
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,959
level three or alternatively we can we

436
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:56,480
can check this if

437
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:58,560
the first time we update it so if level

438
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,920
in data

439
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,920
then we do this

440
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:06,480
if level not in data

441
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,480
if we don't the first time we visit them

442
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:11,280
a new level we record it then you'll be

443
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,199
two the three will never get

444
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,959
the chance to update

445
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,039
right make sense

446
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,839
yeah so once we get this the answer we

447
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,640
just need to push the answer to it so so

448
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,839
for

449
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:26,720
i in sorting we need to sort it

450
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:30,000
sorted the data the keys yeah the key

451
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:32,080
the data keys will be the levels

452
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,240
the levels insulted answer will be zero

453
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,960
one and then we answer

454
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,919
the append

455
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,200
append

456
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,200
data i okay

457
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,360
then that will be the answer for the

458
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:48,240
definition for the levels left side view

459
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,360
or right side depending on how do we

460
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,720
how to

461
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:55,360
visit how to visit the final tree

462
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,880
all right why are you lost

463
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,720
a little bit

464
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,720
not too much not too much if you

465
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,880
understand what i'm talking about here

466
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,760
yeah it's depending on look if we want

467
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,320
to let look here this this symmetry

468
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,559
from the left if we want to

469
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,120
get the left side view

470
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,880
yeah if we if we want to get the left

471
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,080
side let's talk about this pre-order

472
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,880
yeah no

473
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,960
left to right okay no the left right

474
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:25,120
would be one two three okay one two

475
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:27,440
three one two three okay

476
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,679
one two three

477
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,200
the depth search

478
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,280
we visit the definite search but for

479
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,720
each when we visit the node we we pass

480
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,360
the level

481
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,200
yeah we pass the level so we put we use

482
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:44,160
the level as a key

483
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:47,679
to store the values for each level

484
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:50,640
in a dictionary in that in a hash map

485
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:52,960
so if we visit all the tree in one two

486
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,520
three right

487
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:58,240
yeah if we visit the three in one two

488
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:00,240
three and we update the the hash map

489
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,960
first layer second layer

490
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,640
the

491
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,720
data one

492
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,160
will be three that's the right side view

493
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,120
right

494
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,720
or

495
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,039
if we want to

496
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,280
update the hashman the first time we

497
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:15,280
don't update it the second time so theta

498
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,919
one would be two then that's the left

499
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,039
side view alternatively we can do this

500
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,080
note

501
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:23,679
right r will be reversed in order

502
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,559
if we do this in reverse you know there

503
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:29,760
will be one three two so there'll be one

504
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:31,200
three two so if we update these

505
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,200
then that would be

506
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,120
the opposite it'll be opposite right

507
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,520
yeah

508
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,520
yeah yeah

509
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,520
so that's the test search and the

510
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,120
previous one is the preferences one two

511
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,880
three is easier

512
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,960
follow for the breakfast search every

513
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,960
time we just take everything out because

514
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,919
the notes in the queue belongs to the

515
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:54,080
same level so once we know is the notes

516
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:58,000
on the third level we can append the

517
00:19:54,080 --> 00:20:00,480
left most which is located at q0

518
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,600
or we append the

519
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,840
the last note which is q minus one

520
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,520
depending on if you are looking from the

521
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:11,120
left or from right okay

522
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:13,120
yeah that would be for today bye-bye

523
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,280
yeah the tangent let's see it source uh

524
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,880
o and if the n is the number of nodes in

525
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,240
the binary tree okay and we're using

526
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,360
additional

527
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:24,360
space which is the queue or stack okay

528
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,360
bye
