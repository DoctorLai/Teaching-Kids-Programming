1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,919
oh hello guys

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,160
okay so today we're going to make this

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:09,359
yes look a flashing screen yeah how cool

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,359
is that how cool is that yeah

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,120
so

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,599
so

7
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,560
how do we make this flashing screens how

8
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:19,199
many pixels are there 25 yeah so we just

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,279
need to go through each pixel 25 pixel

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,640
yeah and now we're randomly randomly

11
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:28,400
choosing uh setting is on and off on or

12
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,480
off yeah and what's random what's random

13
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,640
uh just random things

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,399
random yeah it's not it's just what's

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,960
random come on can you explain to me

16
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,280
what's random

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,440
sorry

18
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,160
yeah yeah so can you use the arrow words

19
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,160
to describe the random

20
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,079
random random okay so each it's random

21
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,760
yeah well it's really unpredictable

22
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,840
unpredictable that's a good one okay so

23
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,079
unbelievable yes so just the computer

24
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,320
just make up anything randomly

25
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,960
unpredictable yeah just give give by

26
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,359
odds yeah you throw the coin to the

27
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,119
fro flip a coin and there's a chance

28
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,280
that they could face up or for free

29
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,280
stuff right so here it's the same yeah

30
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,439
for the each piece there's fifty percent

31
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,040
you'll be on fifty percent will be off i

32
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,479
know obviously we need to set the

33
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:19,119
brightness yeah the coin doesn't have 25

34
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:21,600
that's right okay so well but we have 25

35
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:24,640
so okay so you can imagine this is 25

36
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,600
coins here all right and when we

37
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,240
light a pixel so it's facing up okay so

38
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,159
so first of all let's do this basic stop

39
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,640
forever yeah we want to do this forever

40
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:38,159
okay so it generates for us so we just

41
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:42,240
need to go through each pixel yeah for i

42
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,040
in range 25 pixel okay 25 pixels

43
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,720
so

44
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:49,920
now i okay so i from 0 to 25 right the

45
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:53,439
first row first pixel is 0 1 2 3 4 5 and

46
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,040
the second row will be 6 5 0 1 two three

47
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:58,719
four and the second note will start with

48
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:01,600
five yeah so so the rows will be i

49
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:04,159
divided by five yeah

50
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,040
and columns will be i modulus five all

51
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,920
right

52
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,360
yeah look so how how do we do this look

53
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,680
the rows

54
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,840
you know what do you guys say

55
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,480
the row look at the the number i will go

56
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:20,080
from zero one two three four five six to

57
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,640
twenty four and the rows will be

58
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,680
i divided by five the columns will be i

59
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,280
modular phi okay so can you explain can

60
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,800
do you understand this bit the line

61
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,840
three and number four

62
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,640
yeah do you understand yeah okay yeah

63
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,720
okay so now we've got the status equals

64
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,640
the random in okay run give a random

65
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,640
number with zero one okay

66
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,760
okay

67
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,239
okay now

68
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,360
now if the status is on

69
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:52,160
then we we obviously we want to plot

70
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:55,519
project plotted close column yeah

71
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:58,080
if the status is off we want to unplot

72
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,440
it all right and plot it

73
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,840
yeah

74
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,720
actually this is the row column okay row

75
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,000
column

76
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:10,080
you're right yeah okay so look now a

77
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,920
little bit look let's let's click on

78
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,239
this look look you see

79
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,120
yeah but each pixel is is roughly the

80
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:20,000
same size yeah we want to make it some a

81
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,080
bit dark some a bit bright okay so we

82
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
can do this

83
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,720
set brightness yeah and there is a

84
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,680
number from 0 to 255

85
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,640
so to 255 is the

86
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:37,040
brightest yellow is the darkest so we

87
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:39,120
set the blended in from 0 to 255 okay

88
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,879
yeah and a little bit look some are a

89
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,760
little bit smaller right let's see it's

90
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,879
not always the same size do you get it

91
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,879
yeah

92
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,560
yeah makes sense okay so the most

93
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,400
important thing here is the number three

94
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,319
and number four okay i feel like you

95
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,879
know quite understand this a little bit

96
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,879
so look

97
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:01,200
so i will be a number okay so that i

98
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,599
would be the number from 0 to 24 yeah

99
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,799
like that yeah

100
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,000
like that okay

101
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,000
okay so now

102
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,120
rho i divided by five so this would be

103
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,959
the first row zero zero zero zero and

104
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,359
then the second row at least in row will

105
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,600
be you up one one one one one and that

106
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,759
will be two yeah this is the row

107
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,600
okay do you get it that's the row i

108
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,759
divided by five

109
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,639
one four yeah

110
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:31,440
uh that's the i okay and then column

111
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:33,919
what's column column would be

112
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:38,160
would be modulo 5 right so that would be

113
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:43,120
what module 5 will be 0 1 2 3 4

114
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:45,120
0 1 2 3 4 0 1 three four yeah three yeah

115
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,600
make sense yeah

116
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,440
do you get it do you understand do you

117
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,759
understand this bit okay can you tell me

118
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:56,720
what what's what's this bit

119
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,720
what's this big um it's basically row

120
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,360
yeah basically yes we want to iterate

121
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,320
the rows and columns well actually we're

122
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,000
not iterating the rows of current we are

123
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:10,520
there's another way of doing it okay

124
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,520
instead of doing this okay just remember

125
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,240
we can do this i'm commenting out we can

126
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,320
for r in range five we can just

127
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,720
just iterate iterating the picture the

128
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,520
columns yeah this is the same thing yeah

129
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,759
so

130
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,759
uh

131
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,400
this is the same thing as the previous

132
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,400
one okay just two different ways of

133
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,400
doing mistakes

134
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,400
okay

135
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,520
okay so look

136
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,000
that would be the same yeah that would

137
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,320
be equally the same yeah got it

138
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,039
that makes sense look this way

139
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,800
this way we are iterating row and a

140
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,880
column so that would be

141
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,880
that these two variables are partitions

142
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,039
are known by the iteration this is the

143
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,720
yeah but this one we are iterating with

144
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,720
a single variable and we convert the

145
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,680
single level to

146
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,880
to it all right yes so

147
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,160
so

148
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:14,400
to sum up to sum up yeah so we can do

149
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,960
this look we can look this is zero zero

150
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,840
yeah so we if we number the pixel will

151
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:22,400
be zero one two three four five six

152
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,160
seven eight nine etc okay so that's the

153
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,479
first way we're converting these the

154
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,880
number back into the rows and columns

155
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:31,120
but and for the second method we're just

156
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,080
iterating the row and the column yeah

157
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,560
row number zero column that'll be that

158
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:41,560
row number one i'm gonna be right okay

159
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,560
yeah okay well that will be it for today
