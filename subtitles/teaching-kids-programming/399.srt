1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,840
hello hello hello sir miss lauren all

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,399
right

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,599
okay so what's graph

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:12,320
it's a graph okay graph is a collection

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,759
of the vertex and edges right

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,679
g

7
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,960
vertex and edges

8
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,000
so

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,199
can you guess what is a connected graph

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,600
what if

11
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,800
i say a graph is connected what does it

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,640
mean

13
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,840
anybody

14
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,399
the vertex yeah this is the

15
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:35,760
vertex anyway any idea

16
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:38,879
is this a connected graph

17
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,559
why is that because

18
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,360
yeah it's not connected yeah and how

19
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,640
about this one is it connected

20
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,600
yeah

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,360
yeah

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,280
this is a connected ground yeah and it

23
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,719
doesn't have cycle yeah so we can call

24
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,360
it a tree right

25
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,120
yeah directly a cyclic graph okay

26
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,199
it's not

27
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,079
it's it's not directed okay it's

28
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:03,199
undirected actually okay

29
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,439
okay so today given a graph which is

30
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,200
connected okay make sure we understand

31
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:08,000
this connected

32
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,040
and

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,840
and directional graph

34
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:17,920
and direct idyllic graph okay so this is

35
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,880
kinetic and directed graph uh connected

36
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,759
you know

37
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,640
i can do by has cycle somehow yeah you

38
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,720
can have a cycle

39
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,479
given this given uh

40
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,799
a graph how so how do we represent the

41
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:33,200
graph remember we have two ways of

42
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:36,400
representing which which one is the

43
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,560
adjacentness yeah

44
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:41,119
ryan are you all right yeah

45
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,320
adjacent this another one is adjacent

46
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:44,799
magic

47
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,280
these are the two ways to represent the

48
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,119
graph data structure using the computer

49
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,200
right adjacent is

50
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,000
so look at what adjacent is so we can

51
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,840
say

52
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,240
node one

53
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,040
links two two three four right so it

54
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,399
links two two three four no

55
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,079
no two

56
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,520
links to one six yeah so this key

57
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,479
yeah all right

58
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,200
key

59
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:12,080
keys are the note the values and the

60
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,360
list of vertex it connects to right

61
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,640
yep

62
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,720
yeah

63
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,879
okay so three

64
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,840
what should i put here

65
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,840
what you have here three

66
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:32,110
[Music]

67
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:41,440
and then six would be

68
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,040
two okay so this is called adjacent this

69
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:47,760
key how come who doesn't have three

70
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,879
we're done where wow that's a very good

71
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,440
spot yeah yeah you're right good job

72
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,360
adjacent is the keys are the vertex the

73
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,120
values are the list of the vertex it

74
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,400
connects to okay

75
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,040
yeah

76
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,879
the adjacent metric adjacent metric if

77
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,680
it's one two three four five then you'll

78
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,959
be

79
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:10,480
like that okay so if this you'll be

80
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:13,120
you'll be a magic yeah you'll be magic

81
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,879
so adjacent magic so let's say

82
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,800
one

83
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:20,239
one to two so

84
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,360
okay so if this is one one to two so

85
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,920
this

86
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,959
connects to two one two three one two

87
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,120
three

88
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,239
okay one two four here

89
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:33,519
two two one two two one

90
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:37,280
two six two six okay you got it so so

91
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:40,480
look if this is magic m i j

92
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,879
means manager means if the vertex i is

93
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,640
connected to vertical string okay so if

94
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,840
it's undirected

95
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,799
if undirected so which means that m i j

96
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,120
equals mji okay in a

97
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,280
you know adjacent metric

98
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,480
so

99
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,640
what happens if mij equals mji in in

100
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:05,439
this metric what happened

101
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,439
if mij equals mji so what does it mean

102
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:11,519
it's going to be one

103
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,400
it's going to be met with the diagonal

104
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,799
right

105
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,720
mij and ji so it means that it's

106
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,680
undirected block okay

107
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,560
because if the vertex one goes to three

108
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,040
also there's a way to go from vertex

109
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,639
three to vertex one okay

110
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,040
yeah

111
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,199
so today easy given a connected

112
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,199
undirected graph yeah we're using the

113
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,960
adjacent list for example

114
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,320
and then we're given this any node for

115
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,000
example

116
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,639
we want to clone

117
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,160
we know what's come on

118
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:45,840
clone what's going on what's this one

119
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,960
what does it mean chrome

120
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,880
copy

121
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,360
copy

122
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,400
okay so when we talk about copy we have

123
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,639
two kinds of copy deep copy

124
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,320
or shallow copy yeah

125
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,840
deep copy

126
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,680
and shallow copy

127
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,080
we mentioned this before yeah what's big

128
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,440
copy what's yellow copy

129
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,840
what's the copy what's yellow

130
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:13,440
copy

131
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:15,199
is so what's deep and shallow d is d

132
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,960
angelic deep

133
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,840
shallow

134
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,039
so usually shallow copy is like you just

135
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,120
copy

136
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:27,600
the aliens aliens yeah alias

137
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,080
it just it doesn't actually copy

138
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,840
everything shallow copy uh deep copy

139
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,639
copies everything

140
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,479
yeah so it makes exactly the same

141
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,479
but a separate

142
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:41,039
but shallow copy

143
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:43,120
may not yeah sometimes it just

144
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,639
copies the alias and then if you

145
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,840
multiply

146
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,280
okay so let's say at least a equals

147
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,520
one two three

148
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,160
if b equals a

149
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,680
this is the shallow copy why is that so

150
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,360
it means that

151
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:01,680
okay one two three a points to here

152
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,199
and then b equals a b also points to

153
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,880
here okay

154
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:08,960
so if i say

155
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:11,520
a a0 changes to yellow

156
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,080
then b0 also changes to 0 because they

157
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:17,280
all points to the same copy right

158
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:20,080
but if i say the d copy then i can say b

159
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,720
equals a remember we talk about the list

160
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,880
comprehension we put a single column

161
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,440
or we can use the copy

162
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:30,080
library dot d copy

163
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,280
and that's the separate copy that in

164
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,960
that case

165
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:38,080
a will points to a one two three

166
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:41,280
b will also copy another one two three

167
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,600
so if you change a zero to zero

168
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,120
it doesn't affect the value of b right

169
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,560
because they are separate they are

170
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,840
different

171
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,319
right i'm right yes

172
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,240
got it so if i say okay eric i make a

173
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,800
copy of you

174
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,360
okay suppose brian you are like

175
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,599
exactly the same copy of

176
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,039
eric okay you are two indeed independent

177
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,919
copies

178
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,960
yeah

179
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,160
okay

180
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,039
you got it

181
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,360
yeah

182
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:12,479
yeah so so

183
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,000
you understand yeah you understand

184
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,400
what's the okay can you give me an

185
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,560
example of the shadow copy

186
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,960
for example you're standing in front of

187
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,639
a mirror instead you're standing in

188
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,120
front of the mirror

189
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,919
the copy in the mirror

190
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,120
is a shallow copy right

191
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:33,120
am i right

192
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,639
yeah yeah because if i touch you here

193
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,440
in the mirror

194
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,199
i also touch the one in the mirror yeah

195
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,599
cut it

196
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,720
yeah make sense but look if i touch it

197
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,400
ryan

198
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,440
i didn't touch you right

199
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,680
you are

200
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,160
independent individual you are deep copy

201
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,160
of each other

202
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,680
okay so today we're going to keep

203
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,199
copying a clone clone usually we mean is

204
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,280
a big copy all right we're going to

205
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:03,280
clone a graph

206
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:05,599
okay so remind me what how many ways of

207
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,960
we can traverse a graph

208
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,280
usually you know

209
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,400
or three remember we talked about this

210
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,840
again

211
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,720
two

212
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,240
from like 99 times

213
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,840
maybe more than that

214
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,960
what kind of

215
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,479
traversal what kind of

216
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,560
we're done question search transfer

217
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,919
search yeah we're going to do this okay

218
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,000
so today we're going to focus on

219
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:31,680
different search okay i know tomorrow

220
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,680
we're going to do this research okay

221
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
so look if we need to go out we want to

222
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,839
copy this

223
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,680
using different search okay now one i'm

224
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,719
here for that one here this is i copy

225
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,920
one

226
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:49,120
okay then he has he has a a list of

227
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:51,120
vertex connects two so i i will

228
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,839
i will clone

229
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,399
the

230
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,360
each node okay

231
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,160
yeah

232
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:01,040
i will close each note but using the

233
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:03,519
definition then i will connor

234
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,720
maybe i would go for two first and then

235
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,120
six first

236
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,720
yeah and then go back and go to three

237
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,080
and then go to four

238
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,800
go to five

239
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,080
okay but since this is undirected if you

240
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,760
all have three

241
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,160
you don't want to go back to one right

242
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,160
so in in that case how do we solve this

243
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:24,080
problem we don't want to revisit it

244
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:26,720
no book we're done using a

245
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,760
headset okay let's say we visited so

246
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,680
that's the

247
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,320
one important thing to

248
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,000
to when we do this definition perfect

249
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,800
search in the graph usually we need the

250
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,959
notebook yeah the hashtag to remember

251
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,839
the vertex we have visited on the right

252
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:43,920
otherwise we were coming going back yeah

253
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,000
we're going back in cycles yeah and then

254
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,080
it will never end all right

255
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,240
okay so let's quickly write this in a

256
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,240
little bit

257
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,839
so how do we define the notebook in

258
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,640
person

259
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:05,680
there are a few ways okay

260
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:08,320
define okay let's say clone

261
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:11,279
chrome graph

262
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,160
let's say we have a graph

263
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,800
uh

264
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,160
maybe we just say a vertex a node okay a

265
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,360
node

266
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,360
a node a note

267
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,279
so let's say we want to define

268
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,279
a clone here

269
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,399
we're given a note

270
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,680
so

271
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,600
we want to

272
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,160
this is the note we currently want to

273
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,959
know we only copy and we also need to

274
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:39,680
provide a parameter which is the hash

275
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:41,839
notebook right so the notes we we can

276
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,240
reference once we copy it

277
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,959
right so let's say we have a

278
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,519
memo okay remember at the beginning it's

279
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,680
a dictionary empty dictionary okay we

280
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,600
can move this memo here

281
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,640
we can move this mammal here it doesn't

282
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,959
it has no problem we can move it this

283
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:03,200
inside the scope of the local function

284
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:06,160
that's fine so if not note yeah if let's

285
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,680
not notice empty will just return

286
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,440
return

287
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,959
now okay

288
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:16,000
and then if the node has been visited

289
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:18,640
in memo

290
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,800
then we return

291
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,720
memo

292
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,640
node okay

293
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,880
yeah look

294
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:29,200
if this note we have been

295
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,360
visited in the memo we return it all

296
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,560
right we create a copy here we have this

297
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:37,120
cloned copy let's say we just say

298
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,959
copy okay this is a copy

299
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,800
which is node

300
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:43,680
and then we are currently copying this

301
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,040
node so now the value

302
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,320
okay

303
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:50,320
and then the second parameter is the

304
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,079
the neighbors the list of the vertex it

305
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,560
connects to adjacent lists yeah so at

306
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:57,440
the beginning is empty here

307
00:11:54,560 --> 00:12:00,000
now this is the key part here once we

308
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,680
have this copy we need to

309
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,519
put it in a

310
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,720
visited step we need to remember it

311
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,880
right

312
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,560
yeah otherwise you come come up we need

313
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,360
to come back again and then we don't

314
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:13,920
want that right so let's say we need to

315
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,600
put it in uh

316
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,920
put it in a

317
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,120
notebook

318
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,720
note equals copy okay we remember it

319
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,480
and then we just we

320
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,360
look

321
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:30,399
here we are in this node here

322
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:33,040
and then we have a list of nodes

323
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:35,360
we copy these nodes so now we we want to

324
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,600
copy which nodes

325
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,600
all the other nodes connected to it yeah

326
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,279
all the vertices connects to it so then

327
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,880
we can say copy

328
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:47,680
stop let's say neighbors yeah neighbors

329
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:50,320
how do you spell neighbors

330
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,360
n e i g

331
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,519
h b

332
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,360
r

333
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:56,890
b-o-r-o-b-o-u-f i think one is american

334
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,279
okay

335
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:01,279
[Music]

336
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,959
english british english poi is the

337
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:05,360
american issue okay

338
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:07,760
neighbors equals then we don't

339
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,880
copy all the neighbors then we can say

340
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,480
clone

341
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,480
calling this function clone yeah

342
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,839
recursion clone

343
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,480
x

344
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:20,680
for x in

345
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,680
in know the neighbors yeah

346
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:26,639
okay this is the trick here

347
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:29,360
a line return copy return copy

348
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,440
and now we can just return

349
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,200
clone

350
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,839
note

351
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,839
okay

352
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,240
yeah look

353
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,360
can we use the cache function remember

354
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,680
we we

355
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:47,279
when we do this dynamic programming we

356
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:49,760
usually put a cache here right yeah

357
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,519
if we put a cache here what does it mean

358
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,880
it actually means that before this

359
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,079
function

360
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,920
is returning the value

361
00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:01,279
we need to put it in the memory so

362
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:03,839
basically you'll be putting here right

363
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:06,079
yeah there's a difference look if we put

364
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,320
a cache here it actually means the

365
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,760
moving this line to here before before

366
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,120
returning

367
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,560
right

368
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,040
all right

369
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,720
then that's a problem why is that

370
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,800
okay look there's a problem so this

371
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,880
doesn't work why is that it doesn't work

372
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,480
okay this doesn't work

373
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,079
so

374
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,600
why we need to

375
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,800
save it

376
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,399
right after we create a node we love

377
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,079
copying the neighbors

378
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,320
right so look

379
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:36,160
we are here means that we have just

380
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,199
copied these without copying the

381
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,360
neighbors

382
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:41,279
now we put it in the visited set or

383
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,199
immediately before we copy in the

384
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:46,880
neighbors yeah

385
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:48,320
if if i move it after then there'll be a

386
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,000
problem

387
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,040
there will be problem look if i move

388
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,279
this

389
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,320
after the copying

390
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,160
after

391
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,320
the neighbors are copied

392
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,920
there will be a problem

393
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,600
can you tell me why

394
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,040
if i move this

395
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,959
move like copy

396
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,240
move the segment in

397
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,160
yeah

398
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,480
move it move these

399
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,920
right after the neighbors called

400
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,800
neighbors are copies there will not be a

401
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,800
problem why is that look

402
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
okay let's say

403
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,279
here yeah that's one two

404
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,639
three

405
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:28,399
yeah look i copy one

406
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,399
yeah the neighbors are two and three

407
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,920
now if i haven't saved it i if i wait

408
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,199
for two and three

409
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,240
to be

410
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,440
copied

411
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,120
clone

412
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,120
and then i put it in a

413
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,079
visited in the memo

414
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,320
then

415
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,399
there will be cycle why is that look

416
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,079
because two

417
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:51,759
if you want to copy two you need to copy

418
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:53,440
one and three but look one relies on two

419
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,880
two lies on one

420
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,040
so that would be your problem why is

421
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,759
that i wait for you to finish and then

422
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:02,480
you again wait for me to finish

423
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:05,199
so there will be never ending

424
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,440
there will be never ending do you get it

425
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:09,519
because one said one

426
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,160
the vertex one says okay

427
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:15,519
let's copy two and three and after two

428
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:17,040
and three copy i'll copy acron and i am

429
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,360
mark as

430
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:22,720
i can mark one

431
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:25,040
has been seen i've been visited

432
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,199
but when he when he needs to copy two

433
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,759
then two will say okay i want to copy

434
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:31,839
two now let's let's wait until one and

435
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,680
three are finished

436
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,680
but the thing is the one needs to wait

437
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,959
for two and two says okay i need to wait

438
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,880
for one

439
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,639
what does that mean

440
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:44,399
they're just waiting for nothing yeah

441
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:46,079
everything you say okay wait and ryan i

442
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,040
wait until you

443
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,160
finish

444
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,639
the play

445
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,079
playing uh yeah playing games

446
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,959
and ryan you say

447
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:56,160
okay

448
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:57,279
eric i wait until you finish homework

449
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,240
right

450
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:04,079
yeah and then you you say aaron you said

451
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:06,079
okay i i i start homework before uh uh

452
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,160
after you i played again so there will

453
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,679
be cycle that will be your cycle right

454
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,880
and the recycle

455
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,640
yeah

456
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:16,480
okay so now to how to break this cycle

457
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,079
then i can say okay i start with copy

458
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,919
one right

459
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,240
okay i'm not waiting for two and three

460
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,240
and i say okay one is visited

461
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,480
it's visited even i haven't copied

462
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,280
actually copy the content of two and

463
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,600
three

464
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:32,880
right so when two

465
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:35,840
is visited yeah two is visited and then

466
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:38,799
you'll check okay one

467
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,000
i always i check one i need one to be

468
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:43,360
cloned

469
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,440
but one already been marked as

470
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,400
visited so that's okay he doesn't go

471
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,559
back again

472
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,039
so there's no cycle right

473
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:53,280
so here we don't use the cash because

474
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:55,120
using the cash it will be eventually the

475
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,440
same as moving this

476
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:00,320
before right before

477
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,960
the content the the right value is

478
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,400
recurrence this variable okay

479
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,640
yeah

480
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,799
hold on look look at this

481
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,360
what's this copy the neighbors equals

482
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,559
clone which part is the recursion can

483
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,360
you point it out

484
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:18,559
which part is the question that

485
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:22,000
yeah yeah calling itself come on

486
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:23,760
yeah clone x what's x x is in the note

487
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,200
neighbor so i want to clone the

488
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,799
neighbors

489
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,000
i want to clone everything in the

490
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:30,799
neighbors okay yeah yeah

491
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,559
this

492
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:36,080
what's this definitely your preferences

493
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,840
yeah using the publication yeah

494
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,240
therefore search okay the time

495
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:43,200
complexity is one

496
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,200
if the n vertex and m edges the clone

497
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,559
can make this element

498
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,360
no no no

499
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,559
yeah and all present and vertex and

500
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,919
logic

501
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:55,640
and vertex

502
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,640
m edges okay

503
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,200
okay yeah that's it do some endings

504
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,480
okay that's it for today bye
