1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:03,539
right

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:12,240
okay so we given this maze which only

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:14,400
contains zero or ones and originally

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,680
okay zeros and one okay originally

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,680
you're at top left corner okay so yeah

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,400
here there we go and Ryan yeah you are

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,820
here

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,220
and for each move you can move right

9
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,560
one position to the right or move one

10
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,359
position to the top so you can only move

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,920
to the east

12
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,559
oh

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:38,160
South okay one position

14
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:40,320
and the destination obviously you can't

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:44,120
cross borders

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,120
this is your destination

17
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:51,480
so I'm just asking can you find a path

18
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:54,780
can you find the route that uh write

19
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:57,180
down write down right and then listen

20
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,820
can you find the look is there such a

21
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:02,399
task that you when you cross the path

22
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:05,820
you know when you walk through the dude

23
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,439
you meet equal numbers of ones and

24
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:11,100
dealers

25
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:15,540
okay so equal numbers of 1 and 0.

26
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:17,760
equal ones yeah and equals what Ryan

27
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:21,080
just said what was that right down right

28
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:25,020
down right yeah right now right right

29
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:28,159
down right okay so how many ones three

30
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:32,520
how many zeros three okay another one

31
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:34,740
write down down right right okay okay so

32
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,439
this is a small base we obviously we can

33
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:39,900
look at it but if it's a very big one so

34
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,180
what's your thought uh one hint is that

35
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,979
it you can only move two direction it's

36
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,079
not like four directions it's just two

37
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:48,180
direction it can only work to the right

38
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,560
or walk to the downs we have been

39
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,079
talking about similar program before

40
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,420
right we are trying to find out how many

41
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,759
ways we can

42
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,439
chills from the top left to the right

43
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:02,299
bottom

44
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:06,060
and also we mentioned if we want to

45
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:08,759
bypass if this root needs to bypass one

46
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,800
certain point right we talked about a

47
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:12,360
long time ago we use the combination so

48
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,520
for example here

49
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:20,640
there are three rows here they are four

50
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:23,099
columns right to sum up you need to make

51
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,900
three pounds

52
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:27,480
and four

53
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,400
right in order to get to this point

54
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,980
right so this is kind of like

55
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:35,040
combination problem all right let's to

56
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:36,480
calculate the number of ways from the

57
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,099
top left to the right button but this

58
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,140
this problem is slightly different we

59
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:42,420
want to find out if there's a such pass

60
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:45,680
that when we can work on it we have this

61
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:48,720
equal numbers of zeros and ones

62
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,080
so any idea earlier just random Source

63
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,080
any idea

64
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:58,580
[Music]

65
00:02:54,440 --> 00:03:02,780
but tell me how do you prove us

66
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:02,780
how do we check every possibility

67
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:07,739
so if I'm here with how many

68
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,319
possibilities do we have at each point

69
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:13,440
how many possibilities at each single

70
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:15,720
cell how many possibilities yeah two so

71
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,340
for each one we have two right so let's

72
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,680
say we have a function that's a search

73
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:23,000
right that's a search you remember what

74
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,000
you want to references

75
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:29,519
[Music]

76
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:35,580
okay so by thinking about that which

77
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:35,580
method is suited research says

78
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:41,159
look we are trying to find out if such

79
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:44,099
paths exists therefore such we just you

80
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:47,040
know just walk down a loot until we find

81
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:49,739
one right so that's as such okay let's

82
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,620
coordinate ah C

83
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:54,920
and B can you guess what are these

84
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,920
values

85
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:00,299
what's this okay something what's this

86
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:02,459
yes Rose columns this is this means life

87
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:04,440
look okay so I'm saying this function

88
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:07,440
returns that between

89
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,440
okay

90
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,599
that's that's as such I'm saying this

91
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,660
function I'm defining a function that

92
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,340
can tell me if like the past then wait

93
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:24,660
this function returns true or false

94
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:28,199
right it tells me it tells me

95
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:31,919
it tells me no Killers listen it tells

96
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:33,780
me if I can find a pass from RC from

97
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,600
this location to to the right bottom

98
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:38,639
right as if you if yeah that's a good

99
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,220
guess it's rows column which which

100
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,680
partition right B over if I say it's

101
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:46,400
balanced can you tell me what does he

102
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,400
means

103
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:51,840
it's equal

104
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:54,300
parents how about if I say okay if I can

105
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:59,340
see violence means you

106
00:04:54,300 --> 00:05:01,560
know it is here it's like the same value

107
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:05,660
parents what's better

108
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,660
it's it's kind of it's kind

109
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:11,479
of like it's it's equal and yeah it's

110
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:15,180
equal yes one

111
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:17,759
and also honestly it has the same value

112
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:19,440
okay so in order to find the PATH so

113
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,620
this balance needs to be oh you can

114
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,480
balance them okay come on yeah yeah

115
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,979
listen oh

116
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:29,280
[Music]

117
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:31,259
you were full of okay so both yeah

118
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,360
parents okay so what's this this is

119
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:36,720
better okay so in order to find the past

120
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,759
this balance needs to be equal and

121
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,100
what's the usual value we will present

122
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:42,900
your balance is equal what should I put

123
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,419
here what should I put here well what am

124
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:48,360
I looking for come on it's a balance

125
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:50,280
so okay so this is once how many ones

126
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,620
how many zeros okay how many zeros how

127
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:55,800
many ones okay so in order to find the

128
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:59,160
pass we need these patterns to be yeah

129
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:01,440
right balance maybe here this is yellow

130
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:04,139
right so how about yellow then I said

131
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,600
five minus one because it's it's zero

132
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:10,259
okay minus one we said

133
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:13,680
this is uh positive yeah positive this

134
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:15,360
is negative if we meet one zero we

135
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,479
decrement the balance

136
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:23,039
by one if we meet one once we increment

137
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:26,699
the balance by one and the number of

138
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:30,539
equal zeros and ones it means that the

139
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:32,340
balance will be zero right look plus one

140
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:36,139
plus one plus one

141
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:39,360
one one there are three zero zero zero

142
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:41,490
minus three three plus minus three zero

143
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,619
makes sense so here you don't use

144
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:44,619
[Music]

145
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:50,160
good point yeah but I'm trying to say

146
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:53,639
look yeah that's a very good point yeah

147
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:57,419
look I'm trying to say at this point

148
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:58,319
we are here tfs00 and the balance will

149
00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:01,680
be

150
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,419
the balance will be minus one right the

151
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,120
dependence will be

152
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:09,360
zero the balance will be

153
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:11,639
one the balance will be zero the balance

154
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,240
will be one the parents will be zero

155
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:17,580
when we reach respond we check if this

156
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,380
balance is zero right if it's zero it

157
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:22,020
means that we have equal number of ones

158
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:25,319
and zero makes sense yes so to sum up

159
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:27,419
when we meet zeros we decrease the

160
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:29,940
balance by one when we meet one we

161
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:34,620
increment the balance time one okay

162
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:36,360
okay so that this is okay and we can

163
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,680
solve this using Professor which I'm

164
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,039
going to talk about in the next next

165
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,039
time okay

166
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:46,979
yeah which is tomorrow next year come

167
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,900
online okay so that's uh look at this

168
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:50,699
and then you can improve it later okay

169
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:53,160
this is quite similar to some problems

170
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:56,160
we have talked about before right

171
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,160
balance

172
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:04,919
balance plus equal one if this makes

173
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:08,759
maze RC

174
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:11,400
is one right is one as we need to minus

175
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:14,039
one right okay so this means that if the

176
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,960
maze current position is one

177
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:18,360
we increment the parents by one

178
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:21,900
otherwise we decrement right so we can

179
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:25,020
also do this P plus equal because it has

180
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:28,379
only two values minus one one and then

181
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:30,960
Maze We can do this RC because this is a

182
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:33,419
Topper cutter contains two values couple

183
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:36,599
zero is minus one table one is one right

184
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:38,820
so I will use it this couple and we use

185
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:41,459
the value of the maze to retrieve the

186
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:43,440
value of the minus one or one and then

187
00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:46,140
if B plus equal and then we leave a

188
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:49,920
check if r equal equal rows minus one if

189
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:52,860
it's the uh the last row and if the

190
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:55,860
columns C equals equal columns minus one

191
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:59,100
if it's the destination then we need to

192
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:00,420
return return if b equal equals zero

193
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:03,540
right

194
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:06,899
okay now look I'm at this point right

195
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:09,720
that's a search RCB right I'm moving

196
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:12,660
down so what's this that's a search R

197
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,399
plus one C

198
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:16,080
B right

199
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,360
I'm moving right

200
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:22,200
this is what that's a search

201
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:24,779
ah C plus one B am I the only two

202
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:30,480
position right yeah but we have to check

203
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:31,920
the boundary if ah smaller than Rose

204
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,160
and

205
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:40,500
that's my search R plus one

206
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:44,160
c d level between two and similarly if C

207
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:46,019
plus one uh R plus one okay R plus one

208
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,560
smaller if C plus one is smaller than

209
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:49,560
columns and

210
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:56,640
therefore such r c plus one b

211
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,860
then return true

212
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:02,660
okay otherwise will be 10 false right

213
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:05,279
look does it make sense here

214
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:08,519
look we are at this point recursion

215
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:12,899
right I'm at this point position

216
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:16,019
I'm here I'm here so I have two choice

217
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:17,820
I can go down or I can go right I can go

218
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:18,839
down or I can go right all right go

219
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:21,480
right

220
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:23,760
so if I can go down

221
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:26,100
if I can go down and call this deficit

222
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,720
if I can go down I find the past then I

223
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:30,420
limited return true I don't need to try

224
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,940
the other route right make sense because

225
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:37,459
the question I was asking is there such

226
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:37,459
a path do I need to proof of all of us

227
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:50,220
and if

228
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:52,860
by walking down I have a path I know

229
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:54,959
there's a path not return true

230
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:56,820
okay if there is no pass I need to try

231
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:59,279
working why right I need to try working

232
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:01,200
right okay so this balance thing is

233
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:04,140
updated here right at the beginning of

234
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,940
recursion right instead of updating here

235
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:08,459
okay

236
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:12,120
so is there a problem with this approach

237
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:14,220
yes what's that yes it just keeps going

238
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,920
Rock sorry does it just keep on going by

239
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:19,320
don't just keep going down there are two

240
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:22,040
yeah each partition I can have two parts

241
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,040
but

242
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,860
this is a

243
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:34,500
look this is a performance

244
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:36,720
putting your cash this is the top down

245
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:40,079
dynamic programming why there's a

246
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:42,560
duplication we need to remember

247
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,560
okay

248
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,079
let's Okay okay let's look at this point

249
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:53,820
so how many ways from here to here learn

250
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:56,360
a lot right so here here

251
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,360
here

252
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:03,360
supposedly I know laser path well

253
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,180
there's a path I already calculate this

254
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,459
when the balance is one I can't find the

255
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:11,640
PATH but the thing is that there are

256
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:14,760
many times that this point is passed you

257
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:16,740
know we need to cross this point

258
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:21,060
we need to cross this point therefore

259
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:23,220
says RC Balance so the first time we

260
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:26,339
cross this point for example this value

261
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:28,140
RC Balance we know there is no path

262
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:30,540
there is no such path

263
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:33,360
the second time we cross it with the

264
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:34,800
same RC Balance do we need to do this

265
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,860
again

266
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:40,940
suppose this is huge this is a very huge

267
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:45,180
area it takes like an hour to calculate

268
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:47,220
RCB okay so we're done right

269
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:48,420
we don't because we already know there's

270
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,800
no path

271
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,720
okay

272
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,639
if when I surpass will return in meters

273
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,820
we don't need to catch it actually but

274
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:59,760
if it's a false if there's no path we

275
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:02,519
don't want to spend time calculating it

276
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:06,360
again because we already know we tried

277
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:10,279
last time there's no pass we remember

278
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,279
there's no point to keep trying

279
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:15,540
I might say yeah this point there are

280
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:18,180
lots of ways

281
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:19,279
eventually will come to this point right

282
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,540
okay okay

283
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:24,240
the first time we calculate the result

284
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:27,540
remember it so look the time came back

285
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,279
stay we allow the cash this is

286
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:32,880
explanation right right it's

287
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:34,980
relationship because each point would be

288
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,200
computed many many times it's

289
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:39,660
exponential but with least cache the

290
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,620
number of total States we calculate it

291
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,300
is

292
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:45,120
Rose

293
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:47,459
times columns right look because look

294
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,279
each position when we calculate it we

295
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:52,500
saw it how many numbers in this maze

296
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:54,899
R times C right

297
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:56,160
but we need to remember the third one is

298
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:59,459
the balance

299
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:01,860
companies in RC transparents okay this

300
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:04,500
is the range this is the range okay

301
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:07,279
let's face complexity obviously

302
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:10,560
the same yeah we need a

303
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:12,600
array to study this is top down we're

304
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,639
using a cache the computer does the job

305
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,560
first the computer maintains a notebook

306
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,540
for us but we can do this in photo app

307
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,120
dynamic programming as well the opposite

308
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:24,060
photo app is non-trivial to right to

309
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,279
implement top down is easier

310
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:28,320
compound is easier because we just put

311
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:31,620
in the cash this is the magic keyword to

312
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,480
turn these proofers into uh top Cloud

313
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:35,420
anime programming by the numbering this

314
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:39,480
is quite similar and Fibonacci number

315
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:43,019
Fibonacci number F and equal f f n minus

316
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:46,260
1 plus f n minus two

317
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:49,019
yeah look quite similar look in order to

318
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:51,660
calculate FN we need to two recursive

319
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:53,100
call with a smaller problem right with a

320
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:55,320
smaller phone

321
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,220
yeah this is quite similar look at each

322
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,760
location

323
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:02,160
we need to solve two recursive functions

324
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:05,040
if it's flowing to two we need to

325
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:07,139
remember but if it's flowing to one we

326
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,959
may not need to remember another example

327
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:14,639
why we may not need to remember the

328
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:15,480
factorial f n equals n times f n minus 1

329
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,000
right

330
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:20,699
do we need to pull the cash here no

331
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,620
probably no right cover now because each

332
00:15:20,699 --> 00:15:24,480
F value is only calculate once if you

333
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:27,180
want to calculate F4 you need to

334
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,459
calculate F3 in order to calculate F3

335
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:31,320
you need F2 in order to pack your F2 you

336
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:34,500
need to take the F1 which we know is one

337
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:36,720
right so when we get the one we come

338
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:40,920
back to calculate F2 come back to take

339
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:43,279
the S3 F1 but when we calculate F4 F3 F2

340
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:46,680
F1 it's only calculated once am I right

341
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:47,899
but here here why is it pregnant more

342
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:52,199
than one

343
00:15:47,899 --> 00:15:56,399
F4 equals F3

344
00:15:52,199 --> 00:16:00,720
plus F2 F3 equals

345
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:03,779
F2 plus F1 you see the problem

346
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,399
F2 here F2 here

347
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:06,959
okay

348
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:08,959
so we need to calculate because

349
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:12,720
otherwise we spend time

350
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:16,199
recalculating it F2 equals F1 plus F0

351
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,760
okay look F1 again okay so what have you

352
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:20,339
learned today

353
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:22,860
and about a maze

354
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:26,779
problem so what are we trying to do what

355
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:26,779
kind of solution we have and that's it

356
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:40,980
the numbers like what one zero ones or

357
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:43,079
zeros or ones and zeros and so we were

358
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:46,800
we gonna

359
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:49,440
we're gonna reached the top left is the

360
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:52,860
star and the top and bottom right into

361
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,600
the destination and so

362
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:59,160
and so

363
00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:04,620
we wanted to have a we want a part of my

364
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:08,360
hat must I have we want to know if if is

365
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:13,140
there any possible part that the pub

366
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:16,740
contains the same number of zeros and

367
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:19,500
ones we can do three four seven candy

368
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:21,299
top down okay let me tell them yeah

369
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,720
dynamic programming what's dynamic

370
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:23,720
programming

371
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,980
yeah the key thing is remembering and

372
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:31,559
using an intermediate results okay this

373
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:33,960
is solving the smallest size problem

374
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:36,240
okay another thing is that look we're

375
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:39,600
working from the top left to the bottom

376
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:42,720
line and we all can also do the opposite

377
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,340
walking from the bottom right to the Top

378
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,280
Line it's the same right we talk about

379
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:49,559
finding the nearest exit in the maze

380
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:52,559
we can start from the engine to find the

381
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:55,320
exit or we can start from any exit to

382
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,340
find the entry this is bi-directional

383
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:59,220
right

384
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:03,000
okay that's it for today happy New Year

385
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:03,000
happy New Year bye
