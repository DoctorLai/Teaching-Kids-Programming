1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,600
good

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:07,520
hello mr mr ryan are you right

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:10,000
okay so let's give an a positive um

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,280
let's given a long negative integer like

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,960
five

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,560
and we want to know the minimum number

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,359
of steps to reduce the zero okay so for

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,880
one step you can either divide it by two

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,199
if it's even

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,760
or minus one subtract one

11
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,119
if it's odd okay and if we want to find

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,279
out the minimum

13
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,359
so what's the strategy here

14
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:34,079
let's say five how how do we get the

15
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,320
five to zero

16
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,239
subtract five

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,120
no no you can only subtract one divided

18
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:43,200
by two it's okay one one one one yeah

19
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,399
and they are five nine five steps right

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,960
so what's the minimum number of steps

21
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,680
five when we subtract one it'll become

22
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,320
four and then

23
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,480
sorry divided by two divided by two then

24
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,520
it becomes two

25
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:02,000
divided by two or divided by two all

26
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,159
subtract one that matter and then yeah

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,640
and so that's one two three four four

28
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,600
step but if you do this five

29
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,560
four

30
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,600
three

31
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,560
two

32
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,880
one

33
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,960
uh is it the same yeah

34
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,159
okay so in this case

35
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,320
is it the same

36
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,960
it's different but for the top one you

37
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,200
just did one and one oh one okay

38
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,840
one zero okay so now you have done so so

39
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,560
that this one you have four step yeah

40
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,759
one two three four this step

41
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,320
if you

42
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,680
if we just keep subtracting one and then

43
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,079
it'll be

44
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,840
one two three four five five so the

45
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,680
minimum

46
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,600
okay so

47
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,479
what's the strategy here

48
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,560
i mean

49
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,280
what's the strategy why we choose the

50
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,520
divided by two or not subtract one try

51
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,439
do it divided by two

52
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,119
if it's possible yeah if it's possible

53
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,119
if it isn't then subtract

54
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,560
because subtract divided by 2 is always

55
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,920
faster than structured one right yeah

56
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,520
okay so now

57
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,240
so if we we can just write it the

58
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,720
simulation we can just simulate simulate

59
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,160
the process right that strategy is

60
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,640
greedy is that we we want to subtract we

61
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,120
want to be we want to divide it by two

62
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,599
if it's even because that will make the

63
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,440
number go down quicker than subtracting

64
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,160
one right okay

65
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:27,360
so let's say define

66
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:30,160
steps okay steps and then number

67
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,120
so answer we have answer equals yellow

68
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,239
wire number is not zero right

69
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,120
look here

70
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:40,720
if n is n1 if this is the

71
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,599
if this is

72
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,080
what

73
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,239
odd number right if this is odd number

74
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,959
then we subtract one

75
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,200
otherwise if it's even number we divided

76
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,640
by 2. how can we divide it by 2

77
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,920
and

78
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,680
divided by 2 divided by equal equals 2

79
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,680
oh you can shift one position to the

80
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,120
right remember the binary

81
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,879
okay

82
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,519
okay look finally yeah

83
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,879
four binaries one zero zero right look

84
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,000
yeah

85
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:11,840
alright what's this in binary

86
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,640
uh that is

87
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,720
uh four four yeah four right look two to

88
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,879
the power of two then if i remove one

89
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,680
zero what happens what's the value

90
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:24,000
if i remove one zero fifty one to two

91
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,440
yeah it's like exactly here so finally

92
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,239
if you shift one position into a right

93
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,920
that's equivalent as dividing by two

94
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:33,360
okay and then now look

95
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,599
if if this is odd number we subtract one

96
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,080
if it's an even number we divided by two

97
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:40,400
and then both cases we need to answer

98
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,560
plus equal one right yeah and then

99
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,920
return answer yeah

100
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,560
okay

101
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,000
simple easy yeah

102
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,480
makes sense

103
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,480
yeah look if n n one is uh is is

104
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,560
odd number then we subtract one

105
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,159
otherwise we shift it one two to the

106
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,000
right like that is equivalent to n

107
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,640
divided by two equal and then answer

108
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,879
plus equals one right uh

109
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,959
return and so the time complexity

110
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,200
roughly all log n right because we have

111
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,040
this divided to keep dividing right it's

112
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,000
roughly oh logan okay

113
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,000
so

114
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,880
this is one way of doing it yeah pretty

115
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,239
sim simple and clear right

116
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,919
this is a simulation we call it

117
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:23,440
simulation because we simulate the

118
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:26,240
process and try to

119
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,479
do the subject divide division as long

120
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,479
as we can as long as this

121
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:33,040
even number okay any questions so far

122
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,040
for this one

123
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,280
ryan any questions so far do you

124
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,400
understand this one

125
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,400
yeah

126
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:46,800
okay so now let's take a look at the

127
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,680
binary for example like fifth uh let's

128
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,720
say

129
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:54,000
the let's say what's this in binary one

130
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:57,199
zero one zero zero okay

131
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,120
what's this in binary 2 to the power 4

132
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,479
this is 4 right

133
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,759
8

134
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:07,759
16 16 plus 4

135
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,639
20 right 2 to the power of look that's 0

136
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,479
2

137
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,919
4 so here

138
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,960
this is 4

139
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,800
8

140
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,240
16 okay

141
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:21,919
so this is 20 in decimal and maximum

142
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:24,639
okay so for each each yellow yeah for

143
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:26,800
each zero we just

144
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,039
have one division because if it's zero

145
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,800
at the right most it's an even number

146
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,960
right yeah

147
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,600
all right it's an even number so we just

148
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,720
need to divide it right so that comes

149
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,400
one

150
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,400
if it's one what happen

151
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:46,000
[Music]

152
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,000
if it's one will happen

153
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,440
this one

154
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,919
if it is zero if it is zero we need to

155
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,639
sub we need to divide it right if it's

156
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:58,639
one if it's one look if it's one we we

157
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,600
need to subtract it

158
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,840
right

159
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,600
subtract it but it becomes a zero again

160
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,400
right

161
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,479
yeah

162
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,960
it becomes we subtract it it becomes a

163
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,880
zero then what happened we have a zero

164
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,720
we need to divide it by again so each

165
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:17,759
one if each so if we we have a zero

166
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,880
we need to add one if it has one we need

167
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,039
to

168
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,919
add 2 right

169
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:25,520
am i does it make sense

170
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,440
yeah

171
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,319
can you tell me why this is 1 if we have

172
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,319
a 1 is 2.

173
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,039
i just i was just explaining to you if

174
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,039
it's a zero that's easy to understand if

175
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,039
it's a zero that's an even number now we

176
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,639
just divide it by two then get rid of it

177
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,560
if it's one what happen look if it's

178
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,880
this one one one one

179
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:49,360
this is fifteen right subtract the last

180
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:52,000
one subtract zero and then

181
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,560
so you need take two to get rid of

182
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,080
one digit right yeah so we can just

183
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:01,199
convert this number n to

184
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,440
binary and now we count

185
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,720
we count how many of them i

186
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,240
am right

187
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,560
yeah okay so how can we convert to

188
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,560
binary easy

189
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:15,360
so we can do this using the bin function

190
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:18,720
remember let's say this is b equals b

191
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,400
n right pin function binary okay pin

192
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,319
here is another thing it's the binary

193
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,400
stands for binary

194
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,000
and this will give me that prefix a

195
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,120
final prefix

196
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,360
yellow

197
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:33,039
b something and then look if it's 15 it

198
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,240
would give me 0b 1 1 1 1 okay and i need

199
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,360
to

200
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,639
i need to

201
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,080
get rid of the prefix too so i i start i

202
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,000
need to what

203
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,160
so because the first two characters are

204
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,080
meaningless to me so i have to start

205
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,879
from the second character yeah to the

206
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,639
end

207
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,120
and then now once

208
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,639
let me count how many of them so let's b

209
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,840
com

210
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,599
count

211
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,720
string one okay

212
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:00,560
and then zero zeros will be equal to one

213
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,520
the length of b

214
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,440
minus one right right because look this

215
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,360
b b

216
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,080
is only containing

217
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,400
ones and zero if one if what if there

218
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,479
are ones once yeah

219
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,319
you know this this number of ones here

220
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,400
so let's yellow i can do this simple

221
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,360
mathematics subtract it from the total

222
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,759
length right so number 10

223
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:27,360
return what once

224
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:29,280
times two right plus zero

225
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,120
okay here there's one more thing here

226
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,399
minus one why there is a minus one here

227
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:36,880
look just away if it's zero here

228
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:39,360
if it's zero here we already which

229
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:42,159
reached the target but

230
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,919
but we add one so we overcounted one so

231
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,320
we need to substitute one make sense

232
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,320
yeah yeah because if the input is zero

233
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,440
what happened you the result you give me

234
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,680
is one but

235
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,600
the the truth is it doesn't take any

236
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,200
step it's already zero okay so we have

237
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,240
to subtract one here

238
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:01,040
look look cll equals length minus one

239
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,399
right so look if we plug in here

240
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,880
all right

241
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,839
right if we plug in length b u here to

242
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,720
here

243
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,000
okay

244
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:12,480
return 1 times 2

245
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,920
plus length b

246
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,720
minus 1

247
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,760
minus 1 so these will become simplifies

248
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,200
this

249
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,200
return once

250
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,839
plus

251
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,839
well there are two ones minus one ones

252
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,360
so there's only one ones next plus

253
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,160
length b

254
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,000
minus one okay look this function

255
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,360
converted it's we already have these

256
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,160
impedance functions to convert the

257
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,519
integer to binary final string yeah and

258
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,120
we have to get rid of the first two

259
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,839
characters because the first two

260
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,320
characters is always zero b okay we

261
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,080
don't need this we need to get rid of it

262
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,480
okay so

263
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,160
how can we okay so let's review we talk

264
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,600
about how to convert the number back

265
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,600
into the integer

266
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,360
okay let's reveal a little bit i know b

267
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:59,360
okay so now look

268
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,560
uh 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 how do we convert this

269
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,279
into

270
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,880
how do we convert into decimal so first

271
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,399
of all

272
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,079
if it's zero

273
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,680
we start from the right hand side

274
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:12,800
zero

275
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:15,200
zero if it's zero zero but we look this

276
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:19,360
is two to the power two to the power of

277
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:21,519
one two right plus two to the power of

278
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,360
zero just skip it and one actually we

279
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,720
need to count how many digits on the

280
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,880
right so that would be one two three

281
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,360
four so two to the power four right so

282
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,399
the number is this yeah and how do we do

283
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:35,920
it back like 15 how do we how do we know

284
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,519
let's say 14 okay 14 what's the 14 in

285
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,800
this is the decimal how do we convert it

286
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,839
into binary

287
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:45,200
look divided by 2 7

288
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:47,920
which is remainder is 0 divided by 2

289
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,720
three which reminder is one divided by

290
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,160
two

291
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,160
one remainder is one divided by two zero

292
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:57,360
remainder is one

293
00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:01,200
okay and it's zero so now

294
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:04,240
we write this back so that 14 in

295
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,000
binary is one one one zero okay

296
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,200
yeah make sense

297
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,680
yeah look we divided by two

298
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,720
we had uh how do you call this kung

299
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,399
quote

300
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,680
you know how do you call this what's

301
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,560
fourteen

302
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:21,600
fourteen is quotient

303
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,600
divided by two negative the divided

304
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:28,000
the dividend divided by the difference

305
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,000
okay so which one is divided dividend

306
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,760
quotient okay so quotient and then i

307
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,399
keep dividing by 2. i write the

308
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,839
remainder here is the remainder right 14

309
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:45,519
divided by 2

310
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:47,440
remains 0. 7 divided by 2 remains 1 okay

311
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,680
i already remain here and then the

312
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,720
opposite way you write this so the

313
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:55,760
binary is b equals 14. okay

314
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:58,480
yeah let's write another one like

315
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,800
25 okay what's 25

316
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,160
divided by 2

317
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,279
12

318
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:07,600
remainder 1 right yeah because it's odd

319
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,560
number is 1 divided by 2

320
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,279
6

321
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:13,600
0 divided by two three

322
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,839
zero divided by two

323
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,839
one

324
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:22,720
yeah

325
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,880
one uh one one divided by two zero

326
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,519
one okay so the result is one one zero

327
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,560
zero one okay let's convert one one zero

328
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,560
zero

329
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,160
one what's this in

330
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,600
in decimal

331
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,480
that's one

332
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,839
two

333
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,360
four

334
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,720
eight

335
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,120
sixteen

336
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,120
sixteen plus eight plus one

337
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,399
twenty five okay we got twenty five you

338
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,720
got it

339
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,240
two ways of yeah finally just finally

340
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,920
