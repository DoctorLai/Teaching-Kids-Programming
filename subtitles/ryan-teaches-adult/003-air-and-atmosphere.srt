1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
hi my name is Ryan and today I'm going

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:08,580
to teach you about the air and

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:11,340
atmosphere so here is a pie chart that

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:15,179
shows what are the gases in the air so

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:18,720
78 of the world are is nitrogen

6
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:21,619
21 of the world is oxygen and one

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,840
percent is other gases

8
00:00:21,619 --> 00:00:27,960
oxygen is a guy that has no color or

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,939
smell so you can see nothing

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,300
as in here but you can't really see

11
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:35,880
anything and it doesn't smell anything

12
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:39,120
when animals breathe in uh they use

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:41,820
oxygen and breathe out

14
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,460
and then breathe it out and it comes in

15
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,940
like a different into carbon dioxide

16
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:50,820
what what do we put now carbon dioxide

17
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:54,300
okay so it's CO2 basically right

18
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:58,020
yes okay or you could just say other

19
00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:00,719
gases since carbon dioxide is just other

20
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:04,320
and that's only one percent of the world

21
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:07,080
when people are climbing mountains to

22
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:10,619
high paths don't really usually have

23
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:12,479
much air so they bring tanks to get

24
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:15,060
oxygen

25
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,760
so they didn't really just like and also

26
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:21,600
simple when you're under water you need

27
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:24,000
a tank to go scuba diving

28
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:28,860
carbon dioxide and

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:33,299
is basically is basically just

30
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:38,000
it is waste from its way from the humans

31
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:38,000
but plants like trees and flowers

32
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:47,040
[Music]

33
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:49,860
so trees breathing carbon dioxide and

34
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:53,939
their wasted oxygen

35
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:57,180
when humans breathe the carbon dioxide

36
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:59,820
goes and the tree socks here and gets

37
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:02,520
oxygen out of it the tree is also need

38
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:06,119
the sunshine to do this right yeah

39
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:08,340
okay carbon dioxide is also used to make

40
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:09,959
bubbles in fizzy drinks

41
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,239
so

42
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:14,400
um and then when if you take it the

43
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,260
bubbles will go up and try to escape by

44
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,060
the constantly but when you open it or

45
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:20,959
go camping

46
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:25,040
and explode

47
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,040
and the bubbles go up

48
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:30,480
to go up

49
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:33,000
and they try to get out of

50
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:37,200
the place

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,200
is also used for some fire in English

52
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,200
extinguishes

53
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:46,980
that you used to get out fire

54
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:51,959
is most flames and it's safe when

55
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:55,560
burning electrical equipment like

56
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:59,340
like the found one

57
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:04,280
and nitrogen is also a gas that doesn't

58
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:04,280
smell of anything and you can't see him

59
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:09,440
living there 78 pack yes definitely

60
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,420
yeah and turn with the food and it turns

61
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:20,400
it bad

62
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:24,239
like Chris

63
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,099
potatoes meat

64
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,959
yeah

65
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:31,019
filling packs it

66
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:34,260
or food with nitrogen gas health and

67
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:37,620
keep them 50 Foods fresh for longer the

68
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:40,799
other gases are found in smoother Mouse

69
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:42,780
than oxygen nitrogen and carbon dioxide

70
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,940
some using

71
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:48,180
store oh documents in case they're full

72
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:52,739
of organ gas it stops them from decaying

73
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:55,739
like it's not dark you can guess for

74
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:55,739
disappearing

75
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:03,120
so they did kept this bit okay neon is

76
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,299
colorless but it's close with an orange

77
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,099
red one that when electricity power

78
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:11,400
through it it's a used to make bright

79
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:15,299
glowing street signs so

80
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:18,120
so if you like see a sign and if you

81
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:21,000
just yeah it glows

82
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:24,180
so you can see online and methane Burns

83
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,860
easily and it's sometimes used as a fuel

84
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:29,660
in power stations

85
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,660
so if you get a power station

86
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,180
and did the chimneys

87
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:41,220
like those

88
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,620
and I'm also going to talk about the air

89
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:46,199
pollution which is like about the

90
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:49,080
congestion chart that's happening so air

91
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:51,240
pollution is built up of Gases such as

92
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:54,660
carbon dioxide methane there's smoking

93
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:56,880
there and atmosphere small amounts of

94
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:59,759
these gases occur naturally but

95
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:02,100
factories cars offices and have produced

96
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,720
a large amount that the plan they can

97
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:07,919
cope with

98
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:10,500
and the these places it is like in an

99
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:14,000
open area

100
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,000
away from the cities

101
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:19,320
from the smoke

102
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,940
no the air pollination can damage well

103
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:23,940
like rivers and building like those

104
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:26,039
breathing difficulties for people so

105
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:28,039
they have to have like the medicine for

106
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:32,460
it

107
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:35,220
the atmosphere is a blanket of gas is

108
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:36,199
that surround the planet it is made up

109
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:39,060
of

110
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:42,600
layers of different mixtures of gases

111
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:46,860
the atmosphere Shields that the planet

112
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:49,800
from the harmful ultraviolet rays

113
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:52,380
of the sun it also attracts you from the

114
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:55,199
Sun Ray close to the surface

115
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:57,479
this keeps the planet warm enough to

116
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,520
support life

117
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:01,259
and there's all it's also in protected

118
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,139
by the ocean and the reason why

119
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:05,880
Australia is like a desert is because a

120
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:07,800
meteor hit there before and now there's

121
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,660
a hole in it so the sun just goes right

122
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,100
through

123
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:15,979
oh really okay

124
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,979
I see well that's new okay and

125
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,560
this is the Earth and this is the song I

126
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:25,199
have to say

127
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:28,500
here's the ozone layer

128
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,479
and this is the Earth's atmosphere here

129
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:35,160
is where the song goes in and then it

130
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:38,340
makes it warm and over here this part

131
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:41,100
which is it just the right amount of

132
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:43,259
heat being trapped there so it doesn't

133
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,560
feel very hot

134
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:48,539
this part is food

135
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,580
greenhouse gases the greenhouse gases

136
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:53,639
such as carbon dioxide so the myth or

137
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:56,699
gases that help to trap some of the sun

138
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:58,580
seed neither in a similar way of grass

139
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:00,840
trapping heat inside the greenhouse

140
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:05,539
greenhouses are basically just like

141
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,539
glass with plants

142
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:13,680
a build up or

143
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:16,500
greenhouse gases trap too much she's

144
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,539
closing the general eyes in the World's

145
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:21,960
temperature known as the global warning

146
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:24,319
here and the ozone layer of the

147
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:27,900
atmosphere contains a gas called ozone

148
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:30,780
the nail absorbs harmful Rays from the

149
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:33,300
Sun by damaged by air pollution in

150
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:35,160
winter and spring a whole form in the

151
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:38,240
ozone layer at the south pole down

152
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,240
harmful right through

153
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,520
so so basically in the North

154
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:50,819
um I made the South Pole

155
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:52,979
here and then this is north

156
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:56,819
South

157
00:07:52,979 --> 00:08:00,960
east and west

158
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:05,900
the South Pole in winter and spring

159
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,900
which is currently right now spring

160
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,560
the ozone layer will make a gap for the

161
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:17,699
sun to

162
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:20,539
make harmful Rays allow go through there

163
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:24,060
okay so the black cap is that original

164
00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:26,599
flare or is it is caused by the air

165
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,599
pollutions

166
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:34,399
it's basically in Winter Spring it just

167
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:39,479
Falls in New England

168
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:41,820
I see so the Gap is it good or bad

169
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:45,120
well I don't really know

170
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:47,880
it says it lets home already three but

171
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,899
I'm not sure okay so it's humbles it's

172
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,360
not good

173
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:54,060
I think so thank you so we talked about

174
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:57,779
the air air pollution the atmosphere the

175
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:59,580
next I'm gonna talk about gravity whoa

176
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:03,120
that's interesting I'd like to hear more

177
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:05,279
about gravity okay I'll fix this yes

178
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,800
I think I learned some but I forget

179
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:11,700
almost everything okay thank you thank

180
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:14,480
you very much thank you bye bye bye bye

181
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,480
foreign
