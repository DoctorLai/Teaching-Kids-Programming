1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:06,920
hello my name is Ryan and today I'm

2
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:06,920
going to talk about this

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,760
is not perfect so cool

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,199
so on the circle

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,260
like that

6
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:23,160
there's a diameter which goes through

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:25,880
that part with that line is called a

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,880
diameter

9
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:35,460
the whole circle here

10
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:37,380
is called the surf ruins I don't really

11
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,600
have to pronounce it it doesn't really

12
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,540
matter

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:45,180
which is how long it is

14
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:49,100
half of the diameter

15
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:49,100
is called a radius

16
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:57,860
and part of the circle like this part is

17
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,860
the ark

18
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:03,960
to calculate how how long is someone do

19
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,540
you need to use

20
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,580
pie

21
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,580
I'm

22
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:14,600
um and Pi is the the letter P in the

23
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,600
Greek alphabet

24
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,100
foreign

25
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:27,500
like 3.142

26
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,500
and it is

27
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:35,939
3.14159 and T six five three five eight

28
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,520
nine

29
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:41,159
um we're taking well that's the disaster

30
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,439
for part of it okay it's good enough yes

31
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,000
yeah

32
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,240
and

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,020
and you can just use

34
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:54,840
3.142 which is special so basically you

35
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,820
just imagine the diameter so you could

36
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:02,100
just do PI

37
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:04,680
D or two pi r which is basically twice

38
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:07,680
the radius with because the radius are

39
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:10,800
the radius equal in the diameter because

40
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:14,400
it's basically half of it

41
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,760
and so if it was 10 centimeters you'll

42
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,760
just be

43
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:23,239
3.142 times 10

44
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,220
which equals

45
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:30,000
31.42 so it's like roughly

46
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:31,920
that centimeters of that part if it was

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,540
10 feet

48
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,379
and

49
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,739
um

50
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:40,200
also a semicircle is half of a circle

51
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:44,640
and you know we did pretty easy

52
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:48,860
this is the diameter of a circle and

53
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,860
a quarter of it is called a quadrant

54
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:55,819
cool slice of pizza yeah

55
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,819
like pizza

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,239
that part

57
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:02,580
okay

58
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:06,000
and

59
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:07,500
the radius the plural of it could array

60
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,040
the eye

61
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:13,560
just spell like this and the radii of a

62
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:17,300
quadrant is always a right angle

63
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,300
like that part okay

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,340
and

65
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:26,400
and or Circle

66
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:29,580
if you put a line across it not a

67
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:33,420
diameter it's called a cord and the and

68
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:35,819
the smaller part of it is called a minor

69
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:38,599
a minor

70
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:38,599
segment

71
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:44,040
and uh

72
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:46,640
the bigger part is called a major

73
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,640
segment

74
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:57,140
and also

75
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:57,140
um I need more space yeah

76
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:02,700
you'll use this okay yeah and remember

77
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:06,680
to wash your hands before you touch your

78
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:09,860
food okay okay also for the circle

79
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:11,599
two pie eyes the

80
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:14,519
parameters right

81
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:17,459
yeah yeah I know how big is this core

82
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:19,680
area yeah yeah is it covered in a book

83
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:21,660
okay okay let's try we talk about it

84
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,259
right it's pi times R times R right

85
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:27,600
remember High r squared notice I read in

86
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:30,120
just the first

87
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:35,220
100 did it and it says

88
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:40,560
um yeah it says three point one four one

89
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:47,639
five nine two six five three five eight

90
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:53,460
nine seven nine three two three eight

91
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:56,460
four six two six four three yeah okay

92
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,720
yeah and also I saw this tab which I was

93
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:00,660
looking at and it showed a million

94
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:03,600
digits of pie if I didn't want to write

95
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:05,220
all of them down yeah obviously it never

96
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,620
ends the pie for the important thing

97
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:10,080
about this place it's not a fix right so

98
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:13,020
they are Unlimited

99
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:16,320
the digits go forever and never repeats

100
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:17,639
right okay and and for the Greek

101
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,300
alphabet

102
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:23,220
um

103
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:27,120
the pie the uppercase that one is like

104
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:32,639
that okay but but the lowercase one

105
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:34,919
the lowercase one is it says it was this

106
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,080
which is normally what you use for pie

107
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:39,720
and you also degree also because it's

108
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,560
not the first one is called Alpha you

109
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,120
say

110
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,300
you said and it's written like that

111
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,699
simple yeah and the next one is better

112
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:50,580
yeah the last one is like Omega and it's

113
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:54,960
written like that the capital

114
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:57,000
and the lowercase was like this yeah and

115
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,419
the next one the old G which is like

116
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,419
gamma

117
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:06,199
something like that yeah okay

118
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:10,020
okay

119
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:11,759
so we talk about the circle okay and uh

120
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:14,220
what's the center of the circle it's

121
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,979
just called center right yeah the radio

122
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:20,039
is the distance between Center to the to

123
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:22,800
the edge of the circle and double it is

124
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:25,860
the is called the diameter diameter

125
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,740
diameter which one is diameter diameter

126
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:31,080
is twice of the radius yes okay the

127
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:33,860
radius is like that yeah diameter is

128
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,860
twice okay yes

129
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,460
better diamond

130
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:41,300
so and it also has infinite light of

131
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:41,300
symmetry

132
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,300
um

133
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:55,560
well I'm just showing the Angles and

134
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:58,440
that's a cute girl or two single reflex

135
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,400
and glue and right angle with it like

136
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,600
that

137
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:06,600
acute article is

138
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:09,660
which is smaller than a right angle and

139
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:11,780
an obtuse angle is bigger than the right

140
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:15,120
angle that's smaller than

141
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:18,419
180 degrees which is a line and the

142
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,860
reflex angle is greater than and it's

143
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:24,720
greater down there

144
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:28,680
80 880 degrees okay good that's good

145
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:31,620
okay so what's next

146
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,120
um yeah just give us a little preview of

147
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,840
what are you going to talk in next

148
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,840
lessons I

149
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:41,360
should always see you okay okay thank

150
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,360
you bye-bye
