going to teach you about being healthy

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,880
so keeping your body healthy is a matter

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,679
of staying active eating the right food

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,760
fighting illness and staying away from

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,440
stops and substance like that have like

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,340
ice cream

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,480
which is bad for you so you shouldn't

9
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,220
really eat

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,420
much of

11
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:33,239
lots of it but foods like fruits and

12
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:36,120
vegetables you can eat a lot because

13
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:38,640
they are healthy for you and normally

14
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,100
fruits have fiber so they could bring

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,420
along the food without them getting to

16
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,420
stop like a banana

17
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:53,120
and also you don't you really eat cake

18
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:56,399
much because they have a lot of sugar

19
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,980
and also no a lot of sweets

20
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,559
and also these are some foods that you

21
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:05,359
shouldn't really you should eat but

22
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:05,359
they're not a lot like eggs

23
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,920
chicken

24
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:16,820
and also they're like milks some milk

25
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,820
and um yogurt

26
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:23,220
and also I'm gonna talk about drugs

27
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,560
so annoying

28
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,140
drugs are basically

29
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,479
but it changed the way how our body

30
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,460
works so

31
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:36,140
Tom's indica's wearing some in a bad way

32
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,140
like medicines medicines

33
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,220
and also it's like addiction

34
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,140
when something is addictive it feels

35
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:49,439
like you're gonna need it even if it's

36
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:52,320

37
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,600
make you sick and physically ill and

38
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,740
many drugs are addictive

39
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,740
like alcohol

40
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,640
because the fact which you might not

also to be healthy you need exercise

63
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:40,739
