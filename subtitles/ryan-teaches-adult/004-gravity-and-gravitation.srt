1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:06,180
hello my name is Roy and today I'm going

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:08,340
to talk about gravity so gravity is a

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,860
force that pulls things together this

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,780
pull is because object has mass the

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:16,379
biggest amounts only bigger the pool

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:18,240
only gravity is really bad object and it

7
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:21,000
is noticeable

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,800
so gravity

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,800
so if you don't know what I mean by

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,859
gravity gravity is basically

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,380
pulls everything down like

12
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:33,600
there's a tree and then an Apple full

13
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:36,899
sounded because of gravity

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:40,559
yeah yeah the Newton right the apples

15
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:42,540
Falls and hit the head of Newton yeah

16
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:46,399
the scientists

17
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,399
okay and mass is basically

18
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:54,059
oh heavy right yeah okay it measures in

19
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:58,100
kilograms the more muscle we can do

20
00:00:54,059 --> 00:01:01,520
bigger photographs so if it is like

21
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,520
let's say

22
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,320
um a thousand

23
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:12,140
kilograms

24
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,140
or at least a million meters

25
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,220
which

26
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,920
don't really use

27
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:22,680
it will be more that it will feel more

28
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,140
quickly because of the gravity

29
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,540
the Earth's gravity is the force that

30
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:31,140
pulls everything towards the ground like

31
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,960
the apples and also this pen

32
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,579
yeah

33
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,740
when you drop something it will because

34
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:41,640
the Earth has a huge mass so the effect

35
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:44,159
of gravity is noticeable notable means

36
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:47,100
you can see it it's like you notice it

37
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:50,960
quite easily it's

38
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,960
and this is the Sun

39
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:57,659
and this is the Earth and the Moon

40
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,880
the Earth

41
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:03,780
I understand both have lots of Master

42
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:07,259
they pull of gravity is Big without this

43
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:10,800
pool if I move float away into space

44
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:13,080
so basically they're together the moon

45
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,879
circles are because of the poor gravity

46
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,800
between the mass of the Moon and the

47
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,379
mass of the Earth the mass of the Moon

48
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,420
is here and

49
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:24,959
so it floats around

50
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:26,879
here the Earth Cycles around the sun

51
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,560
because of the full of gravity in

52
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,800
between the mass of the Earth and Sun

53
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,260
like the moon and uh because the map of

54
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:38,760
the Earth and the Sun they're both big

55
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:41,400
so it's so cool all right

56
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,019
so this song and in case you didn't know

57
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,300
which probably you know if the earth

58
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:48,300
goes around it's have been a year and

59
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:51,920
I'm also going to talk about the weight

60
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,920
if it's up here

61
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,420
say weight is pulled downwards on an

62
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:06,300
object because of gravity it's a full

63
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:09,959
statue depending on where the object is

64
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:12,780
and how much mass it is on the Moon Moon

65
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:15,239
the pool of gravity is less than is in

66
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:17,819
the Earth because the moon had left Mass

67
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:22,920
extend it up

68
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:25,680
just so the gravity the gravity is less

69
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,940
since and the Earth has more since

70
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,000
there's more

71
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:32,819
this is more heavier than that let's say

72
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,580
I think that's nothing okay

73
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:38,340
if you're on the moon you would weigh

74
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:40,200
one sixth of will you weigh now you

75
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:43,500
wouldn't be anything so your mouth will

76
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:45,720
stay the same in space astronauts get

77
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,760
used to feed a night when they return to

78
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:51,840
Earth they feel heavier and they have

79
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:54,319
difficulty moving normally so this is an

80
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,319
astronaut

81
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,420
okay that's like one question

82
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:02,640
things the mass of the earth is bigger

83
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:05,159
than the moon why we don't pull the moon

84
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:10,159
towards you know why the moon doesn't

85
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:10,159
fall to the Earth because it

86
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,379
is a balloon

87
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:21,479
okay I don't know I mean any possible

88
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,860
reasons it's in the space and since the

89
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:26,580
Earth is pulling

90
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:29,000
and maybe the sun is also pulling the

91
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:31,620
Moon

92
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,320
no worries we can find it out later okay

93
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:36,479
the air Finders on both have lots of

94
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,940
maths so they would pull of gravity is

95
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:43,380
Big with Deadpool the Earth and Moon

96
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:45,919
would float away into space okay so it

97
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:49,160
will fly because of the

98
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,160
I see

99
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:55,440
a force meter okay

100
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,740
um

101
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:06,300
that's the fourth meter it's also known

102
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,220
as a Newton meter is a piece of

103
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:11,100
equipment you could use to measure force

104
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:13,800
it the strength of force is murdered

105
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,960
units is called Newton it's a named

106
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,280
after the English scientist so I don't

107
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:21,180
need to

108
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:24,300
yeah you've discovered gravity so it is

109
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:29,220
measured in Newtons yeah so it's n right

110
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:29,220
so the units and Newton yeah

111
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:35,699
and the force of gravity acting an apple

112
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:39,300
mass is pulling the scale down

113
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:42,440
so if you wear an apple

114
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,440
down here

115
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:54,360
it will full it will make this fool down

116
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:58,460
and the meter showed how the Apple

117
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:01,560
weighs in Newtons okay the gravity

118
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:04,080
gravitation new Fields is an objects

119
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,639
gravitational field is an area where

120
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,880
it's forced of gravity can be found

121
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:10,740
everything in our solar system

122
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,360
serpenterizing as it is with the solar

123
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,580
gravitational field

124
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:18,840
the sun currency Fields the planet

125
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:22,500
circle around it so because of its field

126
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:25,860
none of them could just leave like

127
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:29,180
none of them leave they all stay and

128
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,180
circle around the Sun

129
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:36,419
and the center of gravity is an object's

130
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,979
center of gravity it's the point on it

131
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:40,380
where all right same time it doesn't

132
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:42,360
mean that if you push an object up

133
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:45,479
supporting it directly underneath the

134
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:49,080
center of gravity it won't fall over so

135
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:51,300
if you're putting like a sewer lid

136
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,940
if you hold it here it will fall that

137
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:56,120
way so it doesn't but if you hold in the

138
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,120
middle

139
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:03,840
the middle of it is the center of

140
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:05,940
gravity and if you put object up around

141
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:09,120
the center of gravity is easier to keep

142
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:10,380
it balanced so let's say that build a

143
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,259
crane

144
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:15,660
is building and I hold it

145
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:18,720
if it holds in the middle it becomes

146
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:21,120
more balanced but if it holds it like

147
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,180
this it's not that balanced like for

148
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,639
spinning object to be spinning

149
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:29,580
balance it needs to be spinning around a

150
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,740
center of gravity so your plate spin is

151
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:33,840
a skill that involves it's been in place

152
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,979
around the center of gravity which is

153
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,860
very hard

154
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:39,780
so if you want to spin something if you

155
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:41,580
hold it here it won't spin well but if

156
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:43,919
you're holding them until it will Spin

157
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:47,539
and keep on spinning because it's

158
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,539
holding the industrial gravity

159
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:54,900
okay good

160
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:57,660
thank you so what's next

161
00:07:54,900 --> 00:08:01,819
I'm not sure okay we'll worry about that

162
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:01,819
later thank you thank you bye-bye
