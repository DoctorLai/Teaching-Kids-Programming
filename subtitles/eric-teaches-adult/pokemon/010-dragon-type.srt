1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,279
hello my name is Erica and I'm going to

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:09,300
teach you about Dragon time so dragon's

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:12,480
weakness is Dragon Eyes

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:14,460
so dragon is also one of these types

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:19,880
that is Venus and super effective

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:19,880
against himself so it's Dragon I swear

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,859
resistance is electric

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,560
fire

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,560
water

10
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:35,579
grass

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,640
first of all can you draw what it looks

12
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:37,640
like

13
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,059
okay so one thing I'm a little bit

14
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:53,219
confused is that these 18 Pokemon types

15
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:56,520
so for each type how many Pokemons are

16
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:59,760
there oh it's a lot it's a

17
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:02,340
little okay so because the yeah there's

18
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:09,060
a certain amount for each different type

19
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:12,600
so I'm not sure how much dragon has I'm

20
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:15,600
100 sure that ice has the least amount

21
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:19,220
of a Pokemon really the least amount of

22
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,220
Pokemon are ice types

23
00:01:22,939 --> 00:01:28,560
is super effective dragon

24
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,520
that's it so

25
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,659
um

26
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,659
not very

27
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:42,420
paper against steel so this is what

28
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:45,900
dragons look like it's the second best

29
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:48,920
type rank the first type is still right

30
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:54,259
yep Steel Dragon electric

31
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:57,659
fairy ground go guys water fire

32
00:01:54,259 --> 00:02:00,299
dark psychic poison I see yeah because

33
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:03,899
the most popular ones are those stronger

34
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:05,700
ones right so for example like last time

35
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:10,340
this is like

36
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,340
this is like a dragon type Pokemon yeah

37
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:17,060
and this is a

38
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,060
payment

39
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,160
so this is the dragon type Venus and

40
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,099
resistance

41
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,860
so so this is well you know if the

42
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:31,500
appointment these two other permanent

43
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:34,140
attacking the Pokemon the Dragon type

44
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:37,140
Pokemon and these are the weakness

45
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:40,020
weaknesses so if you use a dragon ice

46
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:41,940
fairy will be too effective and if you

47
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,680
use electric fire water grass they'll be

48
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,540
not very effective against the pure

49
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,519
dragon type

50
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,519
and this is a dragon type of Pokemon

51
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:57,959
attacking the Poland

52
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:59,640
so this is what this is super effective

53
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:01,860
against and this is what is not very

54
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,940
effective than this not very effective

55
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:07,140
thing

56
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:11,360
is what this can't do much against and

57
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:15,959
if I can do a law against you get yeah

58
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:21,120
okay good so poor Dragon we can pair up

59
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:24,659
dragon against a load of other types so

60
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:28,920
so one of the best

61
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:33,420
kind of combinations with dragon is

62
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:39,599
dragon and fairy a dragon and fairy is

63
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:43,620
like it's like make it out Mega Target

64
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:45,780
is a dragon effect so if if you look at

65
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:49,260
most of the dragon types the dragon

66
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:53,459
types are kind of Fizz and

67
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:55,920
face and stuff can kind of like a snake

68
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:58,860
photo kind of like

69
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:02,459
stuff that flies well well not all of

70
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:05,220
them flies so a dragon and fairy type

71
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:07,860
it'll be super effective against very

72
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:10,700
very significant against

73
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,700
fighting

74
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:20,239
oh yeah also I meant we've got to

75
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:20,239
imagine that dragon has no effect

76
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,460
no effect

77
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:32,220
against fairy

78
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:35,040
so no effect it's kind of like it does

79
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:38,040
zero damage too so no matter how much

80
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:41,280
power if it has a hundred part base

81
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:44,520
power it still does a zero and if it's a

82
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:48,180
200 base power it has zero ten by power

83
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:50,160
zero it is always zero so it does

84
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:53,900
nothing against fairy

85
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,900
dragon fighting dark

86
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,300
dark and dragon

87
00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:03,020
so and his weakness is no longer witness

88
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,020
to Ferry

89
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:08,520
an immune and the mean

90
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:11,639
it goes

91
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:15,840
goes down there and vanilla effect goes

92
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:19,699
up here because oh no birming goes here

93
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,699
and then nobody goes there

94
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:28,080
so the immunity is for resistance it

95
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:32,280
resist weakness weakness point is actual

96
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:34,080
dragon type body kind of taking the hit

97
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,500
or dying

98
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,500
foreign

99
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:47,100
type is immunity dragon

100
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:49,860
as fairy is immune to dragon

101
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:53,039
it doesn't matter what is paired paired

102
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,960
up with it at least at the fairy tale is

103
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,400
still immune to dragon

104
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,199
so

105
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,199
if not ween is the dragon anymore

106
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,840
poison

107
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:11,039
resistance irresistance to fighting

108
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:18,419
dark and it's not and fairy is not also

109
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:22,580
not very effective against Steel

110
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:22,580
not very effective against poison

111
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,520
so what have you learned today okay so

112
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,919
the best type of dragon yeah it's the

113
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,919
second best time okay so I can still

114
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:33,240
okay so uh how many Pokemons are in

115
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,660
dragon type

116
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:38,340
no I think it's like I don't know I

117
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:40,380
think okay maybe you'll tell me the next

118
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:42,780
lesson okay so each Pokemon type can you

119
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:45,660
name a few because all I have been

120
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:47,699
learning uh in the last 10 lessons

121
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:50,039
including this one is the the type

122
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:52,380
actual types so can you name a you know

123
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:56,160
a concrete Pokemon or the specific

124
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:57,840
a Pacific Pokemon oh yeah yeah

125
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,000
a dragon

126
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,560
oh or any other types it doesn't matter

127
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,940
any other time

128
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:08,660
so for a bit I'm gonna do dragon so

129
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:11,580
there's a Pokemon first dragons

130
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:14,759
including legendary Pokemon and mythical

131
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:16,500
Pokemon oh okay so there's there's

132
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:19,080
pseudo legendary Pokemon there's

133
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:22,199
mythical Pokemon they're the legendary

134
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:24,000
Pokemon Legendary Pokemon is a type of

135
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:25,740
Pokemon which is kind of legendary you

136
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,520
can guess by the name a mythical Pokemon

137
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:32,039
is kind of myth myth kind of thing and

138
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:35,340
pseudo legendary Pokemon are just normal

139
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:38,160
Pokemon but they're as strong as

140
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:41,580
legendary Pokemon and there's at least

141
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:45,660
one pseudo legendary for every different

142
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:48,539
region okay so each Pokemon is different

143
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:51,960
right I mean it has different skills

144
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:53,180
different okay it has different skills

145
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:56,580
abilities

146
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:58,380
and he has to obey in that group in a

147
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:01,860
type right because for example like if

148
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:03,960
it's a Pokemon is in the dragon type and

149
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:08,220
he has to obey all these Blues right all

150
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:11,300
these effective weaknesses yeah because

151
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,300
I see and if it's

152
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:19,080
improves of a very tight and for example

153
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:22,560
let's see um let's say four wheelers as

154
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:24,840
a dragon's minions to fairy but fairies

155
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,539
resistance to theory in the fairies one

156
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:30,840
and dragons and dragon's Venus to fairy

157
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:34,020
so so when they paired up uh

158
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:36,479
a weakness and a weakness and resistance

159
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:38,820
makes it neutral so it does neutral

160
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,940
damage okay and can two programs in the

161
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:44,399
same Pokemon type pair with each other

162
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,080
like two you know two Pokemons of the

163
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,279
same type pair each other tear up with

164
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:52,100
each other

165
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:52,100
so dragon and dragon yay or something

166
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,240
this is called

167
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:04,339
ah I see so this pair up is to waste uh

168
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:08,220
two times coconut type it's not actually

169
00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:11,339
Pokemons no so a single type is a

170
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:14,940
