1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:05,940
hello my name is Eric and I'm gonna

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:09,420
teach you about grass type so grass type

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:13,019
is grass like plants like Pokemon with

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,639
maybe with like leaves what does it look

5
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:16,740
like

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,520
I think it looks a bit I think it's kind

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,520
of like a leaf

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,240
greenness

9
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,579
is fire

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:36,120
eyes

11
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:37,800
flying there is poison

12
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,700
bug

13
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:45,239
not necessarily the best type because it

14
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:49,440
has five weaknesses is fire I find

15
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:54,480
poison fire burn ice

16
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:57,239
freezes flying birds poison

17
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,920
Ing and bugs like to eat grass like

18
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:02,940
caterpillars

19
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:07,439
I think there's like the Cycles like for

20
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:10,880
like fire water grass but and I just I

21
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,880
just talk about that

22
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,280
resistance

23
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,520
it resistance to water

24
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,000
electric electric

25
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:29,100
grass which is itself

26
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,619
around

27
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,580
water water

28
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:34,439
the grass

29
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:36,360
absorbs it

30
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:39,659
Electric

31
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:41,579
yeah there's nothing here yeah and

32
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:43,440
growth doesn't doesn't do it much

33
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:46,489
against

34
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,489
[Music]

35
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:54,119
so it says resistance to ground grass is

36
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:57,119
resistance to water electric Crossing

37
00:01:54,119 --> 00:02:01,680
ground yeah then how about the opposite

38
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:04,040
like water is water resistant to grass

39
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,140
water is not very effective

40
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:09,959
resistance and not very effective are

41
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:12,720
the opposite so water will be not very

42
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:16,020
effective against Grass Electric will be

43
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,940
very effective against Grass Grass will

44
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,319
be not very effective against Grass and

45
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,739
ground would be not very effective

46
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:26,280
against okay and you're basically even

47
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:29,099
seeing the same thing as saying grasses

48
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:31,500
resistance to water grasses resistance

49
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:34,020
to Electric grasses resistant to grass

50
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,120
and grasses resistant to ground okay so

51
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,680
the opposite is not very effective okay

52
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,520
it makes sense

53
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,520
super effective

54
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:48,360
is super effective on water

55
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:50,040
ground

56
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,220
and Rock

57
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:57,120
it absorbs water I think

58
00:02:53,220 --> 00:03:00,480
and Brass because the roots I think

59
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,400
and rock I don't know why I don't know

60
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,239
why it's super effective against Rock

61
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,239
but it just is

62
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:11,159
so the rock is not very effective on

63
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:15,360
grass as well

64
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:18,000
but I don't see in resistance so

65
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:22,440
grass is super effective against like

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,620
like these yeah is not always grassy

67
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:27,480
resistance to those I don't I don't know

68
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:29,400
why

69
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,580
you know if you're super effective to

70
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:35,159
something and that is something that you

71
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:37,920
resisted to right

72
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:39,780
oh that's a special case oh yeah I'm

73
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,459
trying to understand why Robbie seems

74
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,280
they're super effective but not in

75
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:48,480
resistance I think Pokemon

76
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:52,260
how one did it is is that the types they

77
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:54,659
kind of related to real life so like I

78
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:57,659
think grass is super effective against

79
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:59,879
Rock but rock is not like not very

80
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:01,739
effect not very effective I think it's

81
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:06,000
just effective because I don't think

82
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:07,519
grass like plants resist like a big

83
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,299
boulder or something

84
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,299
it's not very effective

85
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:16,700
not very effective against Steel

86
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,700
dragon

87
00:04:16,979 --> 00:04:24,240
cross

88
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:26,840
others dead since we just do a coffee

89
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,840
fire

90
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,660
there's a bug

91
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,800
poison fly it's not very effective

92
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:38,940
against

93
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:42,060
seven so it's not really good for like

94
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:45,120
attacking I think it has a little

95
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:47,400
weaknesses no very like it's not like

96
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,100
the best type I was saying in the

97
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,840
beginning like five like there's this

98
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:55,340
chain

99
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,340
it's kind of like a chain

100
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:02,880
like this imagine this arrows like this

101
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,160
is super effective against that and

102
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,740
that's super effective against that and

103
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,540
that's super effective against that so

104
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:12,780
fire

105
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:15,660
is super effective against Grass

106
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:18,180
but you see infected against water

107
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:20,940
and water soon infected against fire oh

108
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,979
yeah that's uh that's how you make a

109
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:26,220
game interesting because you want to

110
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:28,199
balance the different Pokemon types

111
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,639
well that's good yeah it's like a

112
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:35,220
daughter yeah

113
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:37,800
and normally only you're in in when you

114
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:39,060
when you plug no like Pokemon you know

115
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,820
it's like for

116
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:44,039
live Adventure like most of it like

117
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:48,060
Adventures like becoming the Pokemon

118
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:51,479
champion and your status are a fire type

119
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,919
of grass type and a water type and I'm

120
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:56,660
gonna

121
00:05:52,919 --> 00:06:00,960
um so I'm supposed to

122
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:04,500
show a dual type of breath I think grass

123
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:08,100
is like hard to like pair up because

124
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:12,660
grass has a lot of weaknesses here so so

125
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:16,440
if you get a bad combination it kind of

126
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:20,340
makes it worse so grass and The Rock

127
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:24,120
I think there's two girls and rocks uh

128
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:27,780
grass and one grass and rock is cradley

129
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:31,259
which is a I think if the fossil plant a

130
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:34,020
barnacle and I'm going to try to draw

131
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:35,580
here is like I think it's supposed to be

132
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:39,539
a barnacle

133
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:42,380
it's the animal plus flower animal with

134
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:42,380
a flower head

135
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:54,300
this means it does

136
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:56,460
um of a normal effectness and rock is

137
00:06:54,300 --> 00:07:00,360
moved us into fighting

138
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:03,780
as grass it's not resistance grass is

139
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:06,539
not resistance to fighting so and then

140
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:09,300
it just comes a Venus if a grass was

141
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:12,240
resistant to fighting fighting will be

142
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,960
here we rub that out and then put it

143
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,280
there

144
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,259
do you understand

145
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:20,450
yeah kind of yes

146
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:23,570
so for the flying

147
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:23,570
[Music]

148
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:34,740
yeah yeah that's what kind of it is if

149
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:37,919
Rock wasn't resistant to Flying then

150
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:40,380
then we'll just stay there like rock is

151
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,580
resistant to poison

152
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:44,160
well

153
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:46,560
I may put it here

154
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:50,160
broke his resistance

155
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:53,940
Rook oh yeah this is a

156
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:58,380
thing that I was explaining so rock so

157
00:07:53,940 --> 00:08:02,880
rock is my weeners to water water this

158
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:06,479
is n't a grass is resistant to water we

159
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:09,780
we rub the water out now so and now if

160
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:12,479
we put in the neutral

161
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:15,120
it as well as explaining before yeah

162
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:20,220
plus one minus on YouTube yeah

163
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:24,240
rock is also weakness to ground but

164
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:26,819
ground but grass is resistance to ground

165
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,280
so it becomes neutral

166
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:32,520
if it wasn't neutral

167
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:36,860
if if Rock wasn't we miss it'll stay

168
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:40,500
there like electric and rock is also

169
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:43,380
meanest to um Steel

170
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:45,779
grass has no resistance to skills so we

171
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:50,880
put that in

172
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:53,940
rock is also is this weakness to grass

173
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,720
and cross the resistancy grass so you

174
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,720
put that here

175
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:05,040
and rock is

176
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:05,040
resistance to normal

177
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,540
and we put that in

178
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:17,600
and like other ways this um

179
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:22,740
you can't really do that this because

180
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:25,800
this this we can do because and and for

181
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:28,200
one time we can we can do we can show

182
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,060
you what's super effective against but

183
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:33,779
when there's two

184
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:36,779
um when there's two times I we can't we

185
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:39,720
can't we can't do it because you can

186
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:42,839
choose what you're moving we can't like

187
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:47,000
determine what what you're gonna do oh

188
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:49,740
no that's how that's how you win and and

189
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,420
can you just pick two at the same time

190
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:53,220
you know two moves one move and one

191
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:55,860
Pokemon one move for another problem

192
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:57,360
that you just you just you know choose

193
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:59,399
two at the same time

194
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,320
although it doesn't look that way it

195
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:03,720
doesn't work okay you can only choose

196
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:06,060
one more at the time

197
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,279
that one weakness and resistant it's

198
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:11,360
just you can combine yeah you can do it

199
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:11,360
because you have your Pokemon

200
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:18,480
that's right yes

201
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:20,339
and your winner stays the same so yeah

202
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,220
we can do it

203
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:25,440
