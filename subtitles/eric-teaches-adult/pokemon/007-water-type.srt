1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:07,200
hello my name is Eric and I'm going to

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:08,760
teach about water types and water is is

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,120
water yeah

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:16,379
it's like Pokemon

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:18,119
seed like turtles starfish uh I don't

6
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,520
know accidentals

7
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:24,000
um okay so it's just like a thing like

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:28,560
leaving water not not this water

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,400
stuff like that um so the weakness

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,400
grass

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,800
electric yeah grass and electric because

12
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:41,100
if you if you don't like science and

13
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:45,059
stuff like water conducts electricity

14
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:47,840
very well that's right yes

15
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:52,200
so that's why I'm doing it another

16
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:54,000
plants drink water so yeah that makes

17
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,620
sense

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,879
and

19
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:02,820
and it's super effective

20
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:06,240
and obviously tired that doesn't need

21
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,979
explaining that's right yes look

22
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,320
um

23
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:12,740
grounds

24
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,500
Rock ground I don't know if

25
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:18,979
what uh cleans a rock I don't know maybe

26
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:22,500
lift into the ground or maybe

27
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:26,840
flows Rock didn't I but that is how it

28
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,840
is and not very effective

29
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,320
not very effective it's not very

30
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:35,220
effective against

31
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:38,280
water like you know water doesn't do

32
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:40,380
much against water grass because because

33
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,340
grass is a stirring kit

34
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,340
dragon

35
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,860
yeah I think that's it for Dragon I

36
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:52,740
guess like was it

37
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:55,320
like dragons yeah and nowhere effects

38
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:58,140
against Dragon it does it doesn't have a

39
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,939
name with you or anything or not no

40
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,079
effect it's kind of it's kind of just

41
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:01,740
like that

42
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,720
um

43
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,979
the thing is like

44
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:11,700
so this is kind of like a real Pokemon

45
00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:14,220
so this is kind of like oh this is like

46
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:17,220
a Pokemon and it has like a weakness

47
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:21,060
point and but this is kind of like a

48
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:22,680
move like the move and you do this and

49
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:27,599
sorry

50
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:30,599
okay so this could be a regular 35 like

51
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:33,120
this could be a this could be used like

52
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:35,160
any type can be used to get weakness

53
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,940
points and that this is what this is for

54
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:42,780
and five these are all the types that

55
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:45,959
has a weakness point of water and these

56
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:48,239
this has not very effective so this is

57
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:52,080
like kind of however however Pokemon

58
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:54,840
attacks because and it and it doesn't do

59
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,720
much against these

60
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:02,000
makes sense okay okay

61
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:05,760
what works well against water yeah uh

62
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,739
water they say water and

63
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,959
Steel

64
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:12,180
kind of like that so water and steel

65
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:13,739
types

66
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,540
it's

67
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:20,280
not Venus to

68
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:20,280
grass anymore between fighting

69
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:27,420
the greenness to ground as well

70
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:29,580
not very effective so still oh yeah

71
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:32,819
resistance

72
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:35,099
forgot to add that it has a

73
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:37,739
like last time still has a long

74
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:40,500
resistance so it's gonna be

75
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:45,299
loads of space there so it's gonna be

76
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:47,700
like steel Rock a load of that that one

77
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:50,040
is kind of like they're doing water now

78
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:54,120
so

79
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:56,180
so we've got a bunch of like that and

80
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:01,080
what the steam toe is kind of like

81
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:03,180
Empoleon and and water stiff water is a

82
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:06,540
kind of it's really like

83
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:10,319
different and and is and it's a really

84
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:13,980
good type as not very excited I mean it

85
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:17,040
was mostly a lot of water types has a

86
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:21,479
lot of ice type moves so it can get rid

87
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:24,960
of that and mainly with electric so yeah

88
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:27,120
and in real estate I think it's I think

89
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,340
it's like Seventh Place

90
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,880
what does it look like

91
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,880
yeah

92
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:41,300
a drop a water drop yep

93
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:41,300
it looks

94
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:48,060
[Music]

95
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:55,139
like

96
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,520
Peach

97
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,620
okay

98
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,880
so what's next

99
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,160
um I think

100
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,639
I think about

101
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,639
I think

102
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:26,060
fuck okay good thank you bye bye
