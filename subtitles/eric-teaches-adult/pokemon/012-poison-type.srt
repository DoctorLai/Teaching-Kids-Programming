1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,200
hello my name is Eric and today I'm

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,960
going to teach you about poison type so

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,820
poison types of neatness

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,360
what does it look like

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,360
so

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:22,260
okay looks like a ring

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:27,779
I don't know what's that the poison type

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:30,660
Venus is uh ground a psychics grand

9
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:32,700
grand psychic are just super effective

10
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:36,660
and I don't really know about poison

11
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:39,500
like science kind of thing so and it's

12
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,500
resistance

13
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,840
if resistance is

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,040
thrust but I think

15
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,980
poison

16
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,320
um bug and fairy

17
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:06,360
so it has quite a few resistance it's

18
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:09,240
grass fighting poison bug Berry poison

19
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,340
is kind of like that type which is

20
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,760
and not very effective against each

21
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,380
other but I guess most of them are like

22
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,780
that and

23
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:21,200
fighting fighting doesn't do much

24
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:25,740
against poisons

25
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:29,040
grass yeah bug blood's not very

26
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,040
effective very

27
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:38,540
I don't know fairy and it's super

28
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,540
super effective against

29
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,500
awesome fairy

30
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,740
so there's only two poison soup

31
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,479
effective but

32
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:52,259
is

33
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:54,540
grass and fairy and it's neutral to all

34
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:55,920
of us and

35
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,299
for

36
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,299
um it's not very effective

37
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,700
it's not very significant

38
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,920
um

39
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:08,780
poison

40
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,780
as is the ground

41
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:14,160
Rock

42
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:18,959
ghost

43
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:22,560
and it also has a no effect so it's no

44
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,819
there's no effect on Steel

45
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,459
so

46
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:30,420
this is kind of like the

47
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:33,780
the poison poison like me

48
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:37,860
there's last time you mentioned how much

49
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:42,180
was there for each type for for this one

50
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:44,580
it's there's 92 poison types

51
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:47,940
obviously it's gonna change you as

52
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:51,959
there's gonna be added more Pokemon as

53
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:55,680
a month a month about a month ago this

54
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:58,500
new paldia region

55
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,900
and it was in Pokemon Skyline Vada and

56
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:04,260
and there was a new region so me more

57
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:07,500
Pokemon was added and created and so and

58
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:11,099
in their new region there was eight more

59
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:14,280
poison types so so that's added on to

60
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:15,420
90. and so that makes it 92 obviously is

61
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:20,599
Gonna Change

62
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:24,300
throughout so poison types is a good

63
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:26,879
single time and daughter well I guess

64
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:30,239
the best combination with poison is dark

65
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:32,159
poison and dark and

66
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,720
today we talk about that last week right

67
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,080
yeah

68
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:40,159
so

69
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:44,360
what does it mean so it's a very uh

70
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:48,120
effectively feels poison in the dark

71
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:51,379
okay a poison and a dark type so like

72
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,379
Game Freak

73
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:59,819
how they design for dual types is is

74
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:02,360
most of like so if you look at all of

75
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:05,940
the Pokemon of that kind like poison

76
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:07,560
like for for example if you look at

77
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:10,739
normal

78
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:14,939
but for normal most of them are like

79
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:18,120
kind of white so and for the Ghost type

80
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:20,820
and in ghost eyes they're normally black

81
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,320
purple stuff like that so if they want

82
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:25,860
to make a normal and good stuff they

83
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,300
kind of merge them together

84
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,120
so

85
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,800
the poison and dark type I'm not very

86
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:35,400
good at drawing so

87
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,600
there's drapion and scum tank

88
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,720
so

89
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:42,259
and I'm just giving you an idea what it

90
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,259
looks like

91
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:53,460
is it like that no no no

92
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:56,940
I think it has some of this I see things

93
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:59,100
and it has a long well it's kind of like

94
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:02,160
that so it's like a poison and a dark

95
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:05,820
type so that's me trying to draw a

96
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:08,759
drapion the Whiteboard fan so poisonous

97
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:12,960
I guess is in my I think is the most

98
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:17,060
best one so for for poison so it's

99
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,060
really nice too it's not Venus too

100
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:24,139
anymore as you remember

101
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:24,139
dark

102
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:33,300
so immune

103
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:36,300
and it changes to me

104
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:38,820
so they kind of pair up together and

105
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,740
resistance

106
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:44,400
there's no resistance to ferret anymore

107
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:48,360
because because dark is Venus to it so

108
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:51,720
it's going to neutral section so

109
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:56,820
so it kind of does was ordinarily power

110
00:05:51,720 --> 00:06:00,000
is and all of these stuff this thing

111
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:03,060
it changes kind of like it like super

112
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,160
effective times two times divided by two

113
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:08,220
times four divided by four stuff like

114
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:11,160
that so that's going neutral and it is

115
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:13,139
no resistance to fighting anymore

116
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:17,360
or bug

117
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:17,360
as dark as weakness to those

118
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:31,139
and dark is resistance to dark so you

119
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,840
put slot that in

120
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:40,380
and dark is

121
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:44,360
and so it's super very inside here

122
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:44,360
two and ghost

123
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,979
s not very effective it's not very

124
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:53,520
effective against

125
00:06:48,979 --> 00:06:55,020
dark can hit goes like that

126
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,560
so

127
00:06:55,020 --> 00:07:02,699
basically so all you really need to know

128
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:06,300
is kind of like the two task what what

129
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:10,440
kind of like you do types really like do

130
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:13,139
so so they're kind of like oh if if oh

131
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:16,620
this type like if this title is going to

132
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:20,039
stick that to one toe and and and the

133
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:22,740
other pad if resistant to that then you

134
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:26,220
then you'll go to neutral

135
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:30,000
I see okay okay

136
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:32,520
so kind of like poison so right now I'm

137
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,620
just teaching about types but for poison

138
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:39,180
there's a loads of goods and moves like

139
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:43,080
for like for like let's say toxic so

140
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:46,199
toxic is a poison type move that kind of

141
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:49,919
like toxic really and and then it will

142
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:52,979
poison guitar a Target which and the

143
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:56,520
wind went and they hit they get hit by a

144
00:07:52,979 --> 00:08:00,120
poison but they get hurt by poison and

145
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:01,919
and every and and then the poison damage

146
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:06,300
does more

147
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:10,259
the small more every poison damage it

148
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:12,960
doesn't more and there's also abilities

149
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:14,699
for poison like

150
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,400
like

151
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:19,620
I think it's

152
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:23,340
corrosion something like that is allow

153
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:25,800
it to poison steel tights even though

154
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:29,840
it's not has no effect and also it can

155
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:33,000
poison types okay so in Pokemon

156
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:36,959
world there is a how many kind of damage

157
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:41,520
like poison damage and I guess there's a

158
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:43,979
physical damage the foot side so there's

159
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:46,160
stats so

160
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:48,779
stats

161
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,959
there's six I think there's six

162
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:54,240
different type of categories of stats

163
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:58,980
like there's

164
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:02,240
Health points also short H is also HP is

165
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,240
short for help points

166
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:07,080
defense

167
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,399
special defense

168
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,680
attack

169
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,180
special attack

170
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:15,839
speed

171
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:19,140
yeah and that's it so speed speed

172
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,640
obviously is how fast it is so in like

173
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:24,480
in the games

174
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:27,899
the faster the Pokemon so if like one

175
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:30,480
pug like like this is a Pokemon this is

176
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:33,060
a Pokemon this Pokemon is faster than

177
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,740
that Pokemon then this Pokemon gets to

178
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:36,779
start first

179
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:39,779
okay and

180
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:41,519
the special attack the special defense

181
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:42,839
and special

182
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,380
so

183
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:45,380
so

184
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:51,480
let's say attack attack is kind of like

185
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:55,019
physical moves like a like fire punch

186
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:58,380
drain punch wake up slap it's kind of

187
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:59,660
like moves that makes contact like a pot

188
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:03,660
like

189
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:06,480
500 from the punch um

190
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:09,060
uh kind of kind of ones that make

191
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,320
contact like like touches the

192
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,660
appointment

193
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,959
kind of need and

194
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:17,940
for life and special attack is different

195
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:19,760
it's kind of you it's kind of like a

196
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:23,339
range attack like

197
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:26,220
like if like I'm not sure if humans can

198
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:31,800
do range attacks I the only one I know

199
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:33,540
is a spit like meow I was like like

200
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:37,320
water gun

201
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:40,320
it is a long range attack it's from afar

202
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:44,220
it's kind of like opposite

203
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:46,620
so yeah so what's a defense and special

204
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:49,380
difference so

205
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:52,980
it's kind of like special defense is

206
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:57,360
blocking the far a range attacks and

207
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:59,040
defense is blocking the physical attacks

208
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,620
okay so you mentioned the physical

209
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:04,640
attack so physical attacks as opposed to

210
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,640
Ranger attacks

211
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:14,279
so there's no something like a magic uh

212
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:16,320
you know damage like when a castle space

213
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:17,480
you thought how you can cut cut the

214
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:22,200
stairs

215
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:24,600
for casting spells I guess I guess it's

216
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:27,120
there's three I think there's three

217
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,339
different type of attacks there's

218
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,519
there's special attack

219
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:36,000
physical attack and State

220
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:39,300
status attacks it's kind of stages is

221
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:43,019
kind of makes put a kind of condition on

222
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:45,720
the other Pokemon like you can use you

223
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:49,079
can use sleep powder to make them asleep

224
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:52,079
or you can use baby doll eyes which

225
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:53,160
which lowers their attack that's kind of

226
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:57,420
like

227
00:11:53,160 --> 00:12:00,480
status it's kind of like poisoning them

228
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:04,500
like you fund a wave you it's kind of

229
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:06,540
like blowing lowering their stats or or

230
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:09,720
put them in a condition like poison

231
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:11,220
poison paralyze

232
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,079
burned

233
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:14,220
sleep

234
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:17,100
