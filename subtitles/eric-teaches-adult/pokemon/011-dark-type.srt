1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:08,639
hello I'm Eric and I'm gonna talk talk

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:10,320
about um doctor so like the dark is kind

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,900
of like if you look at the dark time

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,360
Pokemon there's like dark yeah how do

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,780
you draw it what does it look like uh it

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,780
looks like

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,619
okay

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,220
I don't know so um

9
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:36,660
his weaknesses is a very

10
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:41,100
fighting and bug

11
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:44,700
so the fairy is kind of like the fairy

12
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:48,719
tales and stuff but it's very fighting

13
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:51,539
and bug I don't know why is that but

14
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,539
that's about it so those are the types

15
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:57,239
that the dark are Avail of a weakness so

16
00:00:54,539 --> 00:01:00,840
how do you interpret it so for

17
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:02,340
weaknesses is so we have a dark type

18
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,920
Pokemon just pretend that's the dark

19
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,520
type Pokemon yeah and so today's

20
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:12,420
Witnesses is this this

21
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:14,939
these type moves and and if that and if

22
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,520
there's the Dark type weakness yeah it's

23
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:19,020
kind of like Venus so this does more

24
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,259
damage to them

25
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:25,020
okay got it so

26
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:29,820
and it's resistant resistance kind of

27
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:33,780
like almost like opposite of weakness

28
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:35,780
it it kind of resists it

29
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,780
um

30
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:42,380
there is the resistance is well dark

31
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,979
and

32
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,979
ghost

33
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,320
s

34
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:57,000
I think that's that's it yeah

35
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,860
and so it's

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,860
it's not very effective

37
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,780
it's not very effective against dark

38
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:10,380
uh

39
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:13,260
don't worry about your kids fighting

40
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:15,000
not very fucking around the fairy

41
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:18,140
so um

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,140
and it's

43
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,280
and they're super effective

44
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,000
who's effective against

45
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,000
well ghost

46
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,660
and psychic

47
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,660
and also it has immune system and an

48
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,660
immunity

49
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,660
psychic

50
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,599
foreign

51
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:54,959
because

52
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,840
I feel like like last time

53
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:05,879
this is an appointment packing so this

54
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,480
is kind of like the body of a dark type

55
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:10,980
like it's resistance and its venuses and

56
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,159
it's also

57
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:16,980
and there's also needed immunities so

58
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:20,340
this is how it how its weaknesses

59
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:22,800
resistance how it how it damages the

60
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,420
dark type Pokemon how it like takes a

61
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,040
move and

62
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:28,560
here is

63
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:31,440
like like we don't have like I'm

64
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,500
attacking with everyone so this is this

65
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,599
is kind of like it it's defenses it's

66
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:39,659
Witnesses and this is kind of like his

67
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:42,239
attack how like how it damages uh other

68
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:44,040
Pokemon like us you can see the effect

69
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,220
against like it and it's not very

70
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:49,379
effective against stuff fighting fairy

71
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:52,459
our last time that appeared in here like

72
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:52,459
you know water

73
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:01,860
it does kind of like new tooth damage as

74
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:04,260
I see as it does like normal damage you

75
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:08,459
have the super stick it's moving forward

76
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:11,099
venuses for very fighting a buggy for

77
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:15,000
Pure for a few adult type

78
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:17,360
um if it does two times the amount of

79
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,360
damage

80
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:22,139
okay usually you say that there's a two

81
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:26,720
type you pair with other type yeah so

82
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:26,720
what's the type like it compared to it

83
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:37,160
[Music]

84
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:39,960
and so some do type Pokemon

85
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:43,620
combinations like I don't know rock

86
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:46,919
gossip I haven't there's no Pokemon

87
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:51,960
which is like a specific like double

88
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:56,479
Thai so for for a dark side let's say uh

89
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:56,479
let's say I'm an adult dragon

90
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:05,300
for adult Dragon it has a

91
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,560
uh so I wear that on your hair

92
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:10,740
and four times

93
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:13,320
Before Time filming this so it does four

94
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:16,740
times a month because dark hand Dragon

95
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:19,160
are both wieners to fairy so

96
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,160
so

97
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,820
much

98
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:32,220
right so if fighting bug

99
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,900
um

100
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,800
very

101
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,800
dragon

102
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:46,460
eyes

103
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:46,460
yes so and resistance to Electric

104
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:52,220
fire

105
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,220
bras

106
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,280
