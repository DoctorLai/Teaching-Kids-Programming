1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,100
hello my name is Eric and I'm gonna

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:08,220
teach you about bug patch so bug type is

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:10,500
kind of like bug and and work and it's

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:13,080
actually what's actually known as the

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,420
weakest type in the game

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,279
because it's so small right yeah I know

7
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,199
yeah yeah is that clean so that's

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,330
probably why so

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,480
it's um

10
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:23,480
[Music]

11
00:00:24,619 --> 00:00:28,820
fighting

12
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,820
around

13
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,720
and grass

14
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:42,000
it because for example for fighting you

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:45,000
can punch you can punch it if you can

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,520
punch your bag or maybe a mosquito or or

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,680
you can punch your wasp with but it'll

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,559
be really inconvenient because they can

19
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:58,879
fly and ground so you doesn't do much

20
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:58,879
against bugs grass bugs eat grass and

21
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:03,899
that's good

22
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,580
this is what they do against psychic

23
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:08,939
dark

24
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:12,600
broth well psychic I don't know why

25
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:15,900
because maybe me but I don't know maybe

26
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:18,540
and dog I think it's because like how

27
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,759
how some books have my videos and dog

28
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,680
doesn't do much against them and graph

29
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,299
they eat grass

30
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,220
okay this is the same thing that

31
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:29,580
resistance and the effective super

32
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:32,220
effective no for bug resistance

33
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:35,460
and see like the Pokemon like taking the

34
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:37,380
damage from from the apartment and

35
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:40,740
either will read spots and super

36
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:43,560
effective is this is how the Pokemon

37
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:46,799
attacks and that how the actual Pokemon

38
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,939
taken taking taking the damage and this

39
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,100
weakness

40
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:52,100
fire fire kills everything

41
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,960
[Music]

42
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,000
and

43
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:07,680
not very effective

44
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,020
so the bug is not buggy is

45
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,940
effective

46
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,640
on it's not very effective against

47
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:17,819
against fire

48
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:21,959
as as but can't do much against like a

49
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:21,959
flame and fighting

50
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:30,319
as as Bots can do much against the big

51
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:30,319
fist oof how about ice type

52
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:38,640
you know freeze it

53
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:42,800
it's not it's not in here okay okay

54
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,800
it's not very effective against poison

55
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:50,459
yeah because I think it's because

56
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:51,360
um I can't do much things we can flying

57
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:53,760
because

58
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,879
because it's a bird

59
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:59,280
it's a bird okay

60
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,260
and it's not very effective against

61
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,940
ghosts because

62
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:05,340
it can

63
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:08,580
really do much and

64
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:10,620
still and fairy you can't do it much

65
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:14,340
against the steel and

66
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:18,180
and fairy is just like the things in

67
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:21,239
fairy tales and it can't and I prefer

68
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:25,560
itself and about funding me

69
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:30,060
so this is it so so as you can see it's

70
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:32,760
it's not it's not like is is known as a

71
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,680
uh weakest guys you can probably see why

72
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:37,080
it's not very effective against

73
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:41,180
like seven times

74
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:44,700
and so it's probably best for a daughter

75
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:47,360
so looking at the bug type Pokemon

76
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:51,360
they're like stuff like bugs like

77
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:54,420
butterflies like beetles

78
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,599
beetles bees

79
00:03:54,420 --> 00:04:01,019
wasps

80
00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:04,799
mosquitoes mantis stuff like that so

81
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:07,620
let's say one of my best for bug is bug

82
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:10,799
and steel the worst type

83
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:12,959
with the best type basically because

84
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,239
steel is the best type and bug is the

85
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,940
worst type the bug toe is known as the

86
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:19,560
worst time and Steel type is known as

87
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,440
the best type I didn't have loads of

88
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:26,100
resistance you're like this this thing

89
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:28,560
is steel this has been here for like a

90
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:32,720
year or so and nothing and haven't had a

91
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,720
dent in it can you draw a bug type

92
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:38,400
no

93
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:41,100
is it like that um

94
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:45,060
is it like that

95
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:47,820
and so so let's see for bug and steel is

96
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:51,360
not really enough to Flying anymore so

97
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:54,240
that's neutral and bug bug resistant

98
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:57,780
it's not resistance to fighting as steel

99
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,960
is clean as if I think and it has a

100
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:03,840
whole body like dark

101
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:06,720
it has and its steel is also a

102
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:10,979
resistance across so

103
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:13,440
two kind of resistance as it resisted to

104
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:16,560
buy twice so so it does

105
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:19,199
so it does four times less

106
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,259
well for number resistance it is two

107
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:25,380
times less but but scaling bug um are

108
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:26,639
both so they go to graphs grass goes

109
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:31,680
here

110
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:34,259
and and it has a hole and Weiner so far

111
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,720
steel is also meaning supplier so it

112
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:39,199
makes up to

113
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,199
oh

114
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:49,080
okay so would move times four times and

115
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,620
the normal

116
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:56,100
quickness is times two but but this is

117
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:58,340
times four so it has a mean weakness bug

118
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:01,080
resistance is not mean it's not

119
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:03,960
resistancy graph ground anymore because

120
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:08,300
because it still is really super brand

121
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,300
and it has a whole one very

122
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:13,680
it's not really listening to rock

123
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,740
because like if green is a rock I am

124
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,560
Rock if there's it and so and see let's

125
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:22,380
do this and so yeah ice

126
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,100
it goes here because yeah

127
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,360
um

128
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:28,319
I

129
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:30,360
and it fairy eyes grass

130
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,960
Electric

131
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:35,699
not very effective against electric

132
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:39,800
I feel that it's not

133
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:39,800
it's too effective against fairy

134
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:45,900
so this is what basically it looks like

135
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:49,199
for a bargain stereotype it

136
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:51,780
it has four times Venus is fire which

137
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:55,100
which is basically like a mainly with

138
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:57,720
weakness for like weaknesses for Pokemon

139
00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:01,380
the damage

140
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:04,560
Times by two twice and but for the main

141
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:08,039
limit as it has to be a dual type and

142
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,800
and both of them have to be penis to a

143
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:13,199
certain point and and it has a day and

144
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,120
it's weak making this is fine

145
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:18,180
so what have you learned today okay okay

146
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,699
the box and the weakest it's not your

147
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:23,720
favorite type right yeah okay your

148
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:23,720
favorite type is uh

149
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:28,580
okay okay thank you bye

150
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:31,699
foreign
