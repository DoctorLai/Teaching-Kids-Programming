1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:07,620
hello my name is Eric and I'm going to

2
00:00:03,319 --> 00:00:10,980
teach you about Pokemon and stuff so

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:17,699
every Pokemon has a weakness every

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:21,240
distance and um some has immunity so I

5
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:24,600
I'm gonna take ice type because it's a

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:27,320
good time to start from and

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,320
it's

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:34,980
Venus to rock fire

9
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:37,680
[Music]

10
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,300
deal

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,840
fighting

12
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,840
weather

13
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,920
squeaky pen yeah

14
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:52,680
okay and and it's super effective

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,579
against Grass

16
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,579
flying

17
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:00,620
um

18
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:00,620
oh yeah ground

19
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,280
and dragon

20
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:13,380
a super effective means it so so

21
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:17,820
it's the grass one of grass's weaknesses

22
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:21,299
is ice so I will do double the amount of

23
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:23,580
damage to these types and and and and

24
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:24,540
these would do double amount of damage

25
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,740
to that

26
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:32,520
I mean Pokemon Pokemon has has some

27
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:34,680
has made sense to color real likes like

28
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,320
rock you can chuck a rock out of Earth

29
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:41,579
and it will break fire you can melt ice

30
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:47,040
with fire it turns to water Still Still

31
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:49,380
um let's say uh a steel got so nice if I

32
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,479
think you can punch a nice annual break

33
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:54,720
grass you can

34
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:56,880
freeze freeze freeze freeze dragon is in

35
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,840
real life so

36
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,340
um

37
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:04,380
so

38
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:08,520
so you have Pokemon has types and

39
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:13,260
and ice and they're single type and do

40
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:17,520
type single type is single type is only

41
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:19,140
has one type and and dual types it has

42
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,940
two types

43
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:26,720
so I if let's say what Pokemon

44
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:31,140
let's say um

45
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:33,959
uh Pikachu Pikachu is uh

46
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:37,260
is a a single type because these are

47
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:40,440
only electric type

48
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:45,120
and it has nothing else really and that

49
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,720
single type and do types for two types

50
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,900
um

51
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:51,720
it has more than two has three times

52
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:54,959
Pokemon's maximum entices two and

53
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,660
minimum entirely as one and

54
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,739
so

55
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:02,879
let's say

56
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:05,420
let's say Charizard is

57
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,420
is

58
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:13,680
a fire

59
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:16,500
and and flying

60
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,819
that's a dual type because it has more

61
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,800
than one type

62
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:21,780
and

63
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,300
for

64
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:28,260
and for eyes

65
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:31,459
and and do toys can change your

66
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:33,900
weaknesses and can change the

67
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:37,319
effective Effect one of the super

68
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,220
effective stuff kind of thing so

69
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:40,680
um

70
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:42,959
that I should be using Rock fire still

71
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:47,879
fighting and

72
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:51,560
let's take let's let's take ice

73
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:51,560
and flying

74
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:59,340
item flying is in okay

75
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:02,640
current combination and flying is

76
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:04,379
resistant to fighting because a bird can

77
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,319
can

78
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:09,480
um pick a person

79
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:12,000
so super weaknesses

80
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:14,280
so awesome flying is not weakness in

81
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,139
fighting and

82
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,959
steel fire

83
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:21,660
Rock flying is Venus to rock because

84
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,400
because Birds hate it when you Chuck

85
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:28,320
rocks at them I'm not sure about that

86
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:32,220
but Pokemon that does it and and steal

87
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:35,900
fire rock and flying flying is also

88
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,900
weakness to Electric

89
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:45,419
it also means to rock so so that's times

90
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,800
two so rock does four times the amount

91
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:51,720
of damage to death so it's kind of over

92
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:55,020
weak uh weakness Point

93
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:58,080
um so an electric and

94
00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:01,080
and there's also flying it's also Venus

95
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,419
to ice but as ice is resistant to us

96
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:05,100
because ice ice

97
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:09,419
um if you

98
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:11,940
Chuck and Ice a knife um it's not very

99
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:14,400
effective so so there's no weakness to

100
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:16,380
Iceberg so these are the weakness so

101
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,500
yeah

102
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:20,540
ending part uh so what have you learned

103
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,600
today

104
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:26,160
okay and then the ice

105
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:29,360
okay that's very interesting thank you

106
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,360
thank you for that thank you
