hello my name is Eric and I'm gonna

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:08,099
teach you about family time and fairy

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,620
types are kind of like like in English

4
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:13,679
like fairies like you have like fairy

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:16,639
tales so it's

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,639
super effective

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,370
[Music]

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,140
it's super effective against

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,140
dragon

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,080
dark

11
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:32,960
I do

12
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:38,880
for Dragon normally in fairy tales I

13
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,940
guess I guess that's kind of a dragon

14
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:44,040
pair somewhere I don't know and not

15
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,260
normally because I don't I don't know

16
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,420
what happens in fairy tales but very

17
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:51,660
very Tales like kind of

18
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:55,320
it it's a based on fairy and very super

19
00:00:51,660 --> 00:01:00,559
effective Dragon Dark fire

20
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,559
so I just we know

21
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:07,020
his weakness is

22
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:09,420
for steel

23
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:12,299
and

24
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:15,299
I I think it's kind of like steel is

25
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:18,060
kind of like a night in fairy tale night

26
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:22,080
and I don't know what's with poison very

27
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,080
can be poisoned yeah

28
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,380
how about a ghost type

29
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,720
yeah so dancing

30
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,680
okay

31
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,020
so it's resistance

32
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:55,159
is resistance to

33
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,159
Very Yes resistance here yes

34
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:05,520
like oh oh it doesn't do much really I

35
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,520
have really sensory bug fighting

36
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,960
foreign

37
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,179
[Music]

38
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:36,440
defeat the Dragon

39
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:43,319
and okay so why the dragon appears in

40
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:46,340
new emu and Super 8 defective how do we

41
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:46,340
interpret this

42
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,200
things and

43
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:55,019
these are kind of like these are kind of

44
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:58,980
like defensive like like the type itself

45
00:02:55,019 --> 00:03:00,660
and and how it how it's um

46
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:04,459
how it

47
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:07,620
um takes the attack and this is how the

48
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:11,480
how it attacks

49
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:20,310
wow they can open doors perfect

50
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:20,310
[Music]

51
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:30,599
yeah so that basically yeah because

52
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:34,200
sometimes kind of like is defensive like

53
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:37,340
fighting dog fighting so like like you

54
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:41,060
said you ghost and

55
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:46,379
and the fairy

56
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:49,019
it's one one of his stuff is mimikyu

57
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:51,360
I think I think that

58
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:54,840
I think that's like we only got some

59
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:57,420
fairy type there is like a non-existent

60
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:02,340
type combinations like fire and grass

61
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:06,120
and and rock and ghosts and so

62
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:07,760
so it goes down very the way we do it is

63
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,879
writing

64
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:14,480
it's no longer

65
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:17,519
it's not as dark because ghost with me

66
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,979
but then like neutral systems

67
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:24,120
and so effective

68
00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:26,880
um ghost is super effective against

69
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,430
ghosts

70
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,199

[Music]

72
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:36,800
and resistance and oh it means you know

73
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,800
more

74
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:00,589
