00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,759
hello my name is Eric and I'm going to

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:09,960
talk about Evie so EV stands for effort

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:11,519
values and in in Pokemon so Evie's is

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,880
basically what you get from like

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:17,820
battling a Pokemon uh every every

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,520
Pokemon drops like different Eevee

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:23,760
different EVS don't drop like the same

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:28,680
EVS I think the maximum EV they can drop

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:32,099
is free so you can get HP EVS attack EVs

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:36,360
and all of the stats EVS

11
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:39,059
I'll be added to you a Pokemon's stats

12
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:42,600
so depending on what Pokemon you like

13
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:45,440
the velocity if a maximum amount of EVS

14
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:49,320
you're a Pokemon can get is

15
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:53,940
510 EVS it takes quite a long time to

16
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:59,160
like even train them a lot they only can

17
00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:01,399
get 255 maximum in one of that

18
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:06,780
by the time your Pokemon

19
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:10,619
reaches level 100 every four EVS will be

20
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:15,299
one point added two you start

21
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:18,180
but I definitely until a little 100 it

22
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:20,700
when you start like low level you don't

23
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,939
see it like added to your stats right

24
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,939
away

25
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:29,659
so since there's only four EVS as it

26
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:33,320
makes one stats

27
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:38,159
one point I mean is

28
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:43,619
255 isn't divided by divisible by four

29
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:46,259
so it's only useful to get 252 EVS EVS

30
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:50,840
which will be 63 points and the last

31
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:50,840
three if you get them will be wasted

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,140
okay and then there's also like vitamins

33
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:04,680
for TV

34
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:08,880
EVS which are 10 10 points no 10 EVS to

35
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:15,000
to depending on What vitamin is it so HP

36
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:20,099
up as 10 EVS to the HP stats

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:26,360
uh protein I had 10 attack EVS

38
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:30,120
and I went as 10 defense EVS

39
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:36,000
and calcium as

40
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:37,739
10 special attack EVS zinc as

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,800
10

42
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:43,980
special defense EVs and

43
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,800
something called carbos at

44
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:50,459
10 EVS to speed

45
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:54,060
since there's only you only can get 510

46
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:56,040
EVS in one Pokemon there's these like

47
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,319
berries

48
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:01,260
team which is

49
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:04,379
can refuse for

50
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:09,620
um EV so you can get like maximum on

51
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:09,620
others thank you bye-bye bye bye
