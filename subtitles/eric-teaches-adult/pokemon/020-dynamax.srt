1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,620
hello my name is Eric and I'm going to

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:07,460
teach you about Diamond neck thing

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:10,980
so from that thing is the thing in

4
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:14,099
generation eight and in sword and shield

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:17,359
so if you don't know if you need this

6
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:19,980
time next brand and uh this we can stop

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,020
what's Timex I mean how do you spell it

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:26,600
like that

9
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,600
okay this is new it basically

10
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:35,280
like Malaga Pokemon have at most full

11
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:38,760
moves it could have three two one and it

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,559
removes change so it depends on what

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,140
type it is

14
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:46,260
and and you're changing to a certain

15
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:49,140
move so obviously they're gonna be some

16
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,039
tumors which become the same time next

17
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:55,820
move

18
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:55,820
so the first is Max strike

19
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:01,699
any normal type attacking move so this

20
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,699
is normal

21
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:08,720
let's just put it as a table

22
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:22,520
and this is going to be the additional

23
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,520
facts so

24
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,520
foreign

25
00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:47,159
strike is it

26
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:50,340
lowers but

27
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:54,439
lose the speed

28
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,439
all the other opponents

29
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:00,560
so the next one is

30
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,899
I don't think we have to pay for like 18

31
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,899
so

32
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:12,180
is Max there

33
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:16,860
is there any fire time we will turn to

34
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,860
max player it will summon

35
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:24,599
in harsh sunlight five housemates are

36
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:28,560
raised by 50 and water timers are

37
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:30,660
decreased by 50 percent and in rain it's

38
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,800
basically we always say water Titan is

39
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:38,760
increased by 50 Cents still type

40
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:41,040
yeah so two times still have to choose a

41
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,400
move and all the moves have a certain

42
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,400
type

43
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:51,980
of water

44
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,980
is Max geyser

45
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:03,680
some someone's rain

46
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:03,680
next

47
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,959
Electric

48
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,959
is Max lightning

49
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:25,680
which summons the electric green looks

50
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:27,360
like it's like the art in Dota is it the

51
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,700
ultimate skills it's not really Earth

52
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,500
and I'm just going to tell you like all

53
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:36,720
of this because we'll be here forever

54
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:41,120
the grass one

55
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,120
is a Max overgrowth

56
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:46,739
we summoned but

57
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:49,519
grassy Terrain

58
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:49,519
poison

59
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,000
Max is

60
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:03,299
what to lose

61
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:06,140
eyes Max hailstorm

62
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:06,140
fighting

63
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:11,120
next knuckle

64
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:22,280
I don't think we have a space on the

65
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:26,340
Whiteboard to squeeze those 18 types

66
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:29,100
one two three four five six seven eight

67
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:32,280
nine halfway there yeah yeah we can

68
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:34,680
squeeze it like this okay yeah maybe we

69
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,440
can some more space on the right okay so

70
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,340
you haven't answered me what's messed

71
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,620
what does it mean

72
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:45,020
is a move

73
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,020
okay this is the name of the move yeah

74
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:53,100
okay it's quite abstract

75
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:54,479
a Max what's the one under the max

76
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,960
imum

77
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,960
this one

78
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,000
of them how about those additional

79
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:07,199
effects you haven't put any on the last

80
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:10,680
five this one is grassy Terrain

81
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:13,500
this one is really special attack

82
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:17,400
this one always attack

83
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:18,720
special defense hail storm okay

84
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,840
I'm not gonna write that down because

85
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,360
that would take for like yeah okay and

86
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,660
also you have some more space because

87
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,660
more

88
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:35,759
stuff well that's what I think yeah

89
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:39,259
we're flying

90

mix

99
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,280
rock or

100
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,940

101
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:32,479
Max

102
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:36,589
[Music]

103
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,479
Darkness

104
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:51,740
Steel

105
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,560
Spike

106
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:04,500
and finally fairy which is

107
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,900
next

108
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,680
Le they're only 17 there is one more

109
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,680
missions I think

110
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:23,520
oh yeah ghost oh

111
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:30,840
thank you Max

112
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:33,560
Anderson

113
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,560
some

114
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:40,979
and also for every stated movie status

115
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:44,220
means are like protect like sources and

116
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:46,759
sleep powder and all of those become Max

117
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,759
guards

118
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,539
so

119
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:54,660
so basically when you dominate the

120
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:57,000
Pokemon becomes bigger and and then the

121
00:07:54,660 --> 00:08:00,199
Diamondbacks is only for three turns and

122
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,599
then he'll become its original size

123
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:06,479
is there a cooldown for that

124
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:10,139
you only can use it once in a battle if

125
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:12,780
the original Pokemon uses protect or

126
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:15,120
detect it takes a little bit of damage

127
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:18,060
you're not fully protected by the

128
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:21,060
Diamondback moves but for Max card it

129
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:24,780
protects it from everything even the

130
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:26,759
dominant and download the last for three

131
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:29,520
times

132
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:32,820
and unless it's already died it just

133
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,979
becomes original and and if you return a

134
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:39,360
dark next Pokemon and you send it out

135
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:41,760
you'll it'll be not done mixed

136
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,800
um what have you learned today okay so

137
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,200
this the time Max is the kind of like

138
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:50,160
level up in the battle and can be only

139
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:54,779
used once so it becomes stronger right

140
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:57,320
yeah yeah it sounds bigger figures means

141
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:57,320
stronger

142
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:08,360
okay that means that in every Pokemon in

143
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:08,360
the battle should do this time maximum

144
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,440
well you don't have to down next

145
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:21,240
very interesting it just last for three

146
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:24,420
turns and then it's only once per

147
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:29,160
beta Okay so

148
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:32,160
is there a counter to that well

149
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:36,300
for like a counter I think it's more

150
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:39,000
like a typing not really like what's

151
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:41,399
accounted to a diamond X it depends on

152
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,560
what the time next Pokemon is because

153
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:47,160
the Pokemon which is dime next is

154
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:50,580
basically uh that Pokemon but strong is

155
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:55,260
and the type of that Pokemon is still

156
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:58,019
the same so you can just use like

157
00:09:55,260 --> 00:10:00,720
but you can go like down next Pokemon

158
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:03,360
against another next Pokemon

159
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,260
okay okay thank you great thank you very

160
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,260
much bye

161
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,140
