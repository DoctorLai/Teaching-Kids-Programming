1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,600
hello my name is Erica mango let's teach

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:10,139
you about rock type so rock type rocks

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:13,980
or Pokemon's make our rocks rocks

4
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:18,980
they're also fossil Pokemon The Rock

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,980
so rock types are weakness

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,119
to grass

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:30,480
water the rock is like a stone right

8
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:35,960
what does it look like

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,960
uh it I think it kind of looks like

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:45,540
weaknesses is like that rock type has a

11
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:49,739
very good defenses and and the stats

12
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:52,739
have a high defense so it has quite a

13
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:54,600
few weaknesses so it's kind of easy to

14
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:57,480
take them down but they still have high

15
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,160
defenses it has a second highest defense

16
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,620
average

17
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,680
start at the highest and we're first

18
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:07,380
place to steal and rock is the second

19
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,580
place for the highest defense yeah it

20
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:14,520
still is harder than the rock I guess

21
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:18,080
and then it's resistance

22
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,080
it's really listen to normal

23
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:27,979
poison

24
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:27,979
it's also resistance to Fire and flying

25
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:35,939
is resistance to normal because like a

26
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:40,079
normal thing can't really a rock

27
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:43,920
poison poison doesn't damage a rock fire

28
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:47,040
I don't think fire travels and rock well

29
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,920
I don't know applying come pick a rock

30
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,000
yeah Fire doesn't burn a rock right yeah

31
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,259
okay

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,259
it's super effective

33
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:01,380
against fire I think you can just Chuck

34
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:03,899
rocks on fire and then you'll cool down

35
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,219
um via ice

36
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:10,979
you can

37
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:12,360
crack a knife from rocks bug

38
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:15,660
s flying

39
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:20,599
I think we're flying I think you just

40
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:20,599
Chuck rocks and it's not very effective

41
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,160
it's not very effective against

42
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,160
fighting

43
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,620
another very quickly against ground

44
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,400
and it's also not very effective against

45
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:42,780
Steel I think it's for steel

46
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:45,660
I think steel is Venus is super

47
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:47,580
effective against rock and

48
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:49,200
rock is not very effective against Steel

49
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:52,379
so against Steel

50
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,700
I have a lot of high defenses so for

51
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:54,840
rock

52
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:59,099
um

53
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:02,099
we can pair up rock with

54
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:05,519
bug if you can't imagine a rock and bug

55
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:10,379
type it's basically a bug with some kind

56
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:13,200
of rock like let's say uh one bottom

57
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:15,680
rock type is shackle and shackle is

58
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,680
basically

59
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,319
it's basically what kind of shackle

60
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:27,540
looks like a a bug with a shell as a

61
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:30,420
rocket it's not a perfect drawing but

62
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:33,360
that's what kind of it looks like and I

63
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:36,840
think fossil Pokemon so if also Pokemon

64
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,599
is is Pokemon okay that came from

65
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,580
fossils and in Pokemon there's also

66
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:44,519
fossils and then you can put in the

67
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:47,940
machine that will turn them to a life

68
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:49,560
and and a lot of rock and I think all of

69
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:52,200
them are rock tops

70
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:55,680
so rocking bug type

71
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,400
is so that's a rock and back yeah that

72
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,400
guy

73
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,200
looks weird and this is also a rocking

74
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,799
bug type Russell

75
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:08,340
looks like the turtle then but you know

76
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:11,060
it has got a very long neck

77
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,060
this is awesome

78
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:20,820
available carrying a big rock it's about

79
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,100
a rock type called crossover I think

80
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:27,060
these are the crusts

81
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:29,400
bug is resistance to grow so it's not

82
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,440
Crossing beneath to a second so it

83
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,340
doesn't know the damage Rockets

84
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,340
resistance to ground

85
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,600
the ground there

86
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:44,060
Mark is resistance you fight in

87
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,380
fighting room is the star

88
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:55,199
Buck is in resistant to water steel so

89
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:58,860
we didn't put any of them there the bug

90
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:02,180
is Venus with fire rock is resistant to

91
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,180
fire so we put that there

92
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:10,380
bug is also means to Flying but rock is

93
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:14,160
resistance to fly plus one minus one

94
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:17,280
zero that's kind of how it works and

95
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:20,040
also the last type bug is Venus 2 is

96
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,180
Rock but Rock is in resistant to rock as

97
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,560
you can see

98
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:24,560
so you put that there

99
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:30,979
so these are all kind of it looks like

100
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,979
for bugging rock types

101
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:44,580
like I said it's kind of like the body

102
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:47,460
but for this one super effective you can

103
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:51,419
use full move so it's he so you can't

104
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:53,639
really like determine like like oh like

105
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:57,120
super effective you have full moves and

106
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:59,940
like the player can easily remove

107
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,699
your Pokemon wants to do so let's say

108
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:07,039
you can choose a type of move you have

109
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:07,039
like on the last one you have four moves

110
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,660
I think it's called the move set so you

111
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,400
have four different type of moves and

112
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:17,039
then you can choose evil for moves to

113
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:20,520
find the other Pokemon but like I said

114
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:23,100
it's your choice so you can't really do

115
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,380
this it's super effective because

116
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:30,080
because it is your choice it's your

117
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:30,080
choice of move so I can't really do this

118
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:37,199
rock is the slowest

119
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:39,840
of all of the types

120
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:43,319
because they're so heavy it moves so

121
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:46,020
slow yeah and it has a lowest average

122
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:50,039
and all of the rock type

123
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:55,039
stats rock type Pokemon stats average

124
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:58,199
speed is lowest is the lowest

125
00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:01,020
so what have you learned today the rock

126
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:03,240
the second is that the second high is

127
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:05,520
the defense Pokemon type after speed

128
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,319
right yeah it's a good story still

129
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,940
moving Pokemon

130
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:12,900
what's next

131
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:15,740
