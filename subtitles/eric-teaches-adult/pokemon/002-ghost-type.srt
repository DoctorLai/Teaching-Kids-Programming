1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:06,839
hello my name is Erica this is the

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,760
second day and I I'm gonna teach you

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:11,519
about

4
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:14,460
ghosts uh go upstairs to go this is kind

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:18,420
of a spirit of a dead person in real

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:21,720
life and it's I I think it's mostly a

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:24,900
myth I'm gonna say about immunity

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:27,359
because ghost has the most immunity I'm

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,400
gonna talk about immunities because I

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,820
know you're gonna say what's that huh

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:35,280
it's like immune and said okay ghost is

12
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:39,540
it's immune

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,100
I mean to oh yeah two

14
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,680
two

15
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:48,000
normal and fighting

16
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:51,300
and guys for me in mutant Pokemon it

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,920
means for example it does zero damage to

18
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:57,840
to the type so so no matter like if it

19
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,660
if it does 10 damage

20
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:04,140
the zero there's there's a hundred

21
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:06,960
damage still the zero so for example

22
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,700
fighting the like you can't punch a

23
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,760
ghost like you can't punch a ghost

24
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:14,520
because yeah you can't yeah zero damage

25
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,920
two girls so it doesn't matter how hard

26
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:20,460
you punch a ghost

27
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:25,400
um because it still does no damage

28
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:25,400
and Ghost types are weakness to

29
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:36,680
and oh wait this is

30
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,680
good

31
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:44,880
this is a very confusing type as it's

32
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:48,180
weakness to him itself so

33
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,640
so it does super effective damage

34
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,220
against ghosts and also his Venus it

35
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,439
goes so ghost does super effective

36
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:59,460
against damage to ghost I don't expect

37
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:04,259
you to understand that but not so dark

38
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:08,579
yeah and oh and and also I'm talking

39
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:08,579
about res resistance

40
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:17,099
resistance means it it kind of resist

41
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:19,800
resist it means it doesn't actually do

42
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:23,580
zero damage it means it's kind of like

43
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:25,260
you it does half damage

44
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:28,760
for example

45
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:30,959
uh if it goes through resistant as a bug

46
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:34,260
and poison

47
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:37,379
for example so it means like blood does

48
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:41,760
half amount of damage to ghosts and

49
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:45,300
poison because like bug you if you bug

50
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,220
doesn't goes and you can't really poison

51
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:51,360
the goat so it doesn't make any sense

52
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:52,680
and so it's kind of resistant

53
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,720
and

54
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,300
and what else

55
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:00,060
weakness resistance

56
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:02,220
okay so which one is uh Stronger like

57
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:05,340
the ghost type or ice ice type we talked

58
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:07,620
about last week oh good size okay

59
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:11,700
so always stronger

60
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:13,680
is it always stronger against times

61
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,180
types in Pokemon if you

62
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,599
guys talk

63
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:22,319
best cut as it is and it also has the

64
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:24,300
most immunities I see okay good what

65
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,840
does it look like can you try it

66
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:29,819
the Ghost type oh it's a kind of drawing

67
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:32,700
this type of sign is this

68
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:35,280
ah

69
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:39,500
it does look like a ghost I guess it

70
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,500
doesn't have red nose and ears and hairs

71
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:46,280
what does it look like

72
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:56,120
I think it's kind of like a snowflake uh

73
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:56,120
it's basically a snowflake

74
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:01,280
yeah I'm not very good

75
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,040
I don't know

76
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:15,780
anyway Pokemon isn't just throwing

77
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:18,660
snowflakes okay yeah okay okay I got it

78
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,500
so oh yeah the super effective we're

79
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,940
super

80
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,380
effect

81
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:25,259
Ive

82
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:29,940
means it does ghost does double amount

83
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:34,320
of damage ghost obviously and psychic

84
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:37,020
okay psychic is basically like light in

85
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,000
Pokemon it does super effective damage

86
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:43,580
and so

87
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,580
so you know like I talked to you about

88
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,380
[Music]

89
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:52,020
a pair of eyes and ghosts like for

90
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:55,680
example a nice and Ghost type is like

91
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,680
for example is

92
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:03,479
um is it like that what's less it is I

93
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,460
think Ghost type Pokemon and so

94
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:07,740
so if

95
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:11,580
so

96
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:14,360
um it's ice isn't resistant to ice so

97
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,360
you put that there

98
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:20,880
ice ice is not clean as you bug and

99
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:23,699
poison so it does normal damage so you

100
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:27,740
keep that there for super effective ice

101
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:27,740
and you put on grass

102
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,520
um

103
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:39,060
dragon

104
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:42,680
and round

105
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,680
you can't really see that but

106
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,520
[Music]

107
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:51,539
and so

108
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:53,340
and its Venus is ISA is leanness to

109
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:56,280
Rock

110
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:57,500
okay Steel

111
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:01,860
fire

112
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:04,620
and that says immune to fighting so as I

113
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:07,259
said no matter how much damage it does

114
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:09,660
there's still zero so it's immunity

115
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:13,320
fighting and normal so you don't put

116
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:16,139
fire in there and yeah okay

117
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:18,240
oh I will have you been today okay so I

118
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:20,400
learned this uh Ghost type yeah so it

119
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,080
looked like a ghost and it's a meal to

120
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,900
fighting normal

121
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,280
what's normal normal fighting no one is

122
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:29,960
oh

123
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:33,300
no one ties is kind of like oh I see

124
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:36,240
okay so he said not like a Pokemon thing

125
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:41,220
right yes okay no it's another type okay

126
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:43,919
and also ghost also has no has no effect

127
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:46,620
on no one I don't know because no one

128
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,960
guess it's kind of like

129
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,960
I see okay

130
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,960
okay

131
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,580
good thank you bye-bye
