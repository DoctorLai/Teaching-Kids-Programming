1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,660
hello and I'm gonna teach you about a

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:09,780
Steel type and a few times has a lot of

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:13,200
this is has a great defense it's more

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:15,960
like a Defender than attacker if yeah it

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,440
defends a lot of other types and and

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:22,279
there's more defense and if it

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,279
resistance

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,420
for resistance is

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,420
resistance to normal

10
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,300
still

11
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,020
sidekick

12
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,440
cross okay bug

13
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,820
ice

14
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:51,620
okay

15
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,940
that's good

16
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:57,180
[Music]

17
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,820
lion Rock I see okay these are not all

18
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,440
of the times

19
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:05,159
these are only one two three four five

20
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:08,040
six seven eight nine okay one two three

21
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:12,060
four five six seven eight nine yeah yeah

22
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:15,540
nine okay so normal is like a person can

23
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:19,200
like a person can't do much uh to a

24
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:22,500
steel boarding like that ah and still

25
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,340
doesn't do much that it's still sidekick

26
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:28,740
like it doesn't do much thing

27
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:32,900
Grass Grass you can't really make a dent

28
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:36,720
bug bug also can't make a dent dark

29
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:38,700
darkness doesn't do much I can't really

30
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,939
freeze it like

31
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:46,579
too hard for beak and rock if you can't

32
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:46,579
make it then okay and there's weaknesses

33
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:55,560
I guess Ghost type is fire ah oh yeah it

34
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:58,200
makes sense yes fire up and make it like

35
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:01,740
soft yeah yeah it doesn't really need

36
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:04,159
that cleaning but I think

37
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,159
okay

38
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,220
around

39
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:14,520
well we advertised which are not in here

40
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:18,300
I definitely need food damage it means

41
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:20,660
no damage and and none of these none of

42
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,620
resistance agreements affected and also

43
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:24,599
now I

44
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:27,680
oh

45
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:27,680
I mean

46
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:34,400
still also has a mean which is

47
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,400
poison

48
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:41,700
ous is fire yet obviously but I think I

49
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:46,040
don't know why but if I think I don't

50
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:46,040
know break punch it really hard

51
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:53,220
and ground to an earthquake chatted to

52
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,980
pieces

53
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:58,920
how about Ghost type

54
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:01,860
neutral okay we need to one two three

55
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:05,220
four five six seven eight nine ten

56
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:07,980
eleven two thirteen and the oven the

57
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:10,140
neutral neutral it means it does no more

58
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:13,440
damage and these don't really affect it

59
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:18,180
it does what is supposed to be but but

60
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:20,640
neutral is um a good good

61
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:24,480
Seattle water

62
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,760
oh oh yeah I forgot a dragon okay so how

63
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,920
many times are there like look like 15

64
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:33,080
right three four

65
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:35,760
here all together they are 15 so

66
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:38,560
there's 18 types okay so that's so

67
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,749
you're missing on there yeah

68
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,749
[Music]

69
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:47,879
10 11 12 13 14.

70
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:53,879
goes in

71
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:59,280
water they are 16. right yeah and also

72
00:03:53,879 --> 00:04:02,819
also steel steel is super effective if

73
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:06,239
it doesn't have much super effective

74
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:08,159
as because it's not a Defender like I

75
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:12,180
said because it has a loads of

76
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:14,180
resistance super effect

77
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,180
Ive

78
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,859
him

79
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:23,460
Rock

80
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:25,860
ice fairy okay but you I see the rock

81
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:28,620
you put it on the resistance as well so

82
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:32,880
look uh yeah yeah it's also super

83
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:36,840
effective and also it's still the super

84
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:39,300
effective is like remove like steel like

85
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:42,199
a Steel type move is super effective

86
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:44,639
against these it's not like

87
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:46,500
yeah so

88
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:50,040
I guess

89
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:52,880
yeah one two three four five six then

90
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:57,780
eight nine ten eleven three

91
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:59,639
fifty sixteen and and 17 18. so

92
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:02,880
basically a little touch that on the

93
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:05,280
board right now uh but I see the rocket

94
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,259
appears twice yeah it does

95
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,720
another ice

96
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:12,360
so but why is it the same type or it's

97
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:15,360
not the same time it is the same time

98
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:18,479
okay but you count it twice yeah but

99
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,800
because this is the move and this is the

100
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,900
actual Pokemon

101
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,620
ah okay

102
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,620
this is

103
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:30,300
the moon actual Pokemon

104
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:31,800
hmm

105
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,199
okay

106
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:38,160
okay a little bit confused about that I

107
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:40,979
think I I got it yeah okay

108
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,840
I see I see okay so what does it look

109
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:44,820
like the Steel type I mean

110
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,740
can you draw I mean every week that you

111
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:51,380
draw something yeah

112
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:51,380
it looks like let me think

113
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:54,960
is this

114
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:57,539
I don't know

115
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,820
if

116
00:05:57,539 --> 00:06:03,840
we actually don't know what's this you

117
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:08,820
look okay I know I know what we are with

118
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:11,120
for fire is oh yeah okay fighting is

119
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,120
just

120
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:20,280
the fifth

121
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:21,840
ah yeah oh this is the Fist and ground

122
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:26,340
is

123
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:29,180
uh looks kind of here okay okay I see

124
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,180
oh poison it

125
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:41,100
and these are the neutrals so if for

126
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,960
example if I want to pair still up with

127
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,360
ghost

128
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,560
deal

129
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,039
ghost

130
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:53,160
huh which is a steel on Ghost type is

131
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:56,100
like eager slash if you can slash is a

132
00:06:53,160 --> 00:07:00,360
stealing this time also also red Pokemon

133
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:04,800
on on Ryan's and Ryan's cake last

134
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:06,479
birthday uh okay yeah I'm still still

135
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,960
good so

136
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:13,560
so fighting as steal his Venus to

137
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:18,060
finding is a meaning to fighting

138
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:19,380
because of ghosts and and we've crossed

139
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,580
that out

140
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:23,819
and

141
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:25,800
and let's see no more

142
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:29,360
it's it

143
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,360
no one has no effect

144
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,199
and psychic

145
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,819
grass

146
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,220
bug

147
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:42,780
dark dark

148
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:46,259
now that need to

149
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:49,440
neutral damage because ghost is weakness

150
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:54,180
to dark so we put that to Nature that so

151
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:57,840
it kind of evens it out okay good good

152
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:59,699
and it's too effective against

153
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,139
sidekick

154
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:04,020
and

155
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:06,539
and guess as low because because that's

156
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:08,819
all for good stuff

157
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:10,560
okay nice

158
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:15,720
yeah

159
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,720
and where have you learned today okay so

160
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:21,120

165
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:34,620
itself is it's just like uh what it

166
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:37,200
means yeah for example like still it's

167
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:39,180
the steel glass is the grass ice is the

168
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,459
guys love is a rock yeah and there's

169
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:45,000
different Pokemon of that type and also

170
00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:46,500
it can turn into two types so it's kind

171
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,040
