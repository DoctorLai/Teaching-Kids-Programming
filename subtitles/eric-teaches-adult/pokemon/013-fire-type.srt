1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,940
hello I'm Eric and I'm going to teach

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:09,620
about fire time fire type is like fire

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:13,920
so I think the majority of them are red

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:17,519
uh orange kind of like that so it's

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,519
super effective

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,580
what does it look like just like a fire

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:27,300
yeah well a friend the Orange is red and

8
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:31,140
the inner bit is like Kind of Blue

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:34,260
yeah the inner bit the bottom part of

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,600
the flame It's Kind of Blue a little bit

11
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:40,559
tiny bit it's still effective against

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:43,860
Grass you can turn the glass yeah I

13
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:46,680
think it's super effective against steel

14
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:49,079
I guess ice and

15
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,600
fire they are just super effective to

16
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,039
each other right because eyes can put

17
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,840
out fire

18
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,480
yeah I

19
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,899
I think that's wrong

20
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,260
[Music]

21
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:04,500
fire melts eyes and then I and then the

22
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:06,540
eyes will melt into water and then the

23
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,060
water will fill out a fire yeah I think

24
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:12,780
that's where you get it from but the

25
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:15,600
thing is the real Pokemon is is

26
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:19,200
and it's kind of like you kind of knock

27
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,960
knock a Pokemon out if

28
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,520
I think it's

29
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,180
sort of

30
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,100
and that I don't think that's actually

31
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:31,799
so a fire super effectively against ice

32
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,960
but I say super effective against

33
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:36,540
ice is not very effective against fire

34
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,360
but on the water water is super

35
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,439
effective against fire okay it makes

36
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,759
sense yes

37
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:47,220
so I and I also I don't really think a

38
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,600
Pokemon will melt

39
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:53,180
okay

40
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,180
and it's not very effective against

41
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:00,360
it's not very effective against

42
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,939
fire

43
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,640
obviously a flame is not very faced

44
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:07,560
against another Flame

45
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,780
water

46
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,540
Rock

47
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:16,500
and dragon

48
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:19,860
Through Fire like I said I think if even

49
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:22,260
I I think most of it is not very

50
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:24,060
effective against each other

51
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:27,360
water

52
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:28,800
that doesn't need explaining rock kind

53
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,280
of I think

54
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,800
it can really burn I don't know I think

55
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,480
it's something to do with like it can't

56
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,440
really spread fire stuff like that

57
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,220
Dragon

58
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:45,900
[Music]

59
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:47,760
so it's Venus is Venus it is a weakness

60
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,760
against

61
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,760
water

62
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,680
Rock

63
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,840
round

64
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:04,800
I think it's kind of like if you Chuck

65
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:06,420
sand or dirt on fire I'm not sure but

66
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,420
maybe it's

67
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,420
resistance

68
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,280
the resistance to

69
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:16,980
fire

70
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,480
grass ice

71
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:21,480
bug

72
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,480
fairy

73
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,239
uh oh yeah and steel

74
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,780
and a vlog has a kind of big chunk of

75
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,720
resistance

76
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:39,900
I think it doesn't have any no effects

77
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,900
or immunities

78
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:48,360
I say I mean there's only two types of

79
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:51,659
fire type as well I think that they

80
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:54,420
um covered most of the Dual types like

81
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:57,060
even though they're like over a thousand

82
00:03:54,420 --> 00:04:00,299
Pokemon they still haven't covered all

83
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:03,599
of the door type like normal and

84
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:07,440
no more and Bug there isn't a normal bug

85
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:09,900
type in Pokemon like 18 times right if

86
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:13,620
you pick two awesome 80 so how many

87
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:16,680
possibilities see 18 times pick two two

88
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:20,699
as a due time all right so this equals

89
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:25,259
18 times 17 divided by two so that's uh

90
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:29,880
9 times 17 so that's uh what 17 times

91
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:33,259
nine I think it's a 157

92
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:41,040
so it's 170 minus

93
00:04:33,259 --> 00:04:42,900
70 right 753 yeah 153 153 okay so 153 at

94
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:47,639
least one Pokemon for each two type

95
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:50,460
right so it means 153. I think

96
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:54,540
show you example of like fire and Bug

97
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:56,340
yeah an idea of fire Embark is one of

98
00:04:54,540 --> 00:05:01,080
the Pokemon Legends in the fire and Bug

99
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:04,080
there is one which is which is a volcano

100
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:06,320
so I think I'm not very good at drawing

101
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,320
so

102
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:11,960
you like a flower

103
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,460
it's like

104
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:23,580
it's something like that butterfly

105
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:26,400
it's it's supposed to be move Moss okay

106
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:28,440
okay so these wings are ready so I think

107
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:32,639
it's kind of or whatever

108
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:35,280
um representation yeah of a sun so and

109
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:38,039
with me to find bug type so there's no

110
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,080
real Instagram anymore because bug is

111
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:42,419
resistant to ground so which makes

112
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,240
ground in a neutral second because a

113
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:46,979
minus one and a plus one makes a zero so

114
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,479
it's a neutral okay

115
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:51,900
do you get that

116
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:55,020
yes kind of yes

117
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:57,180
bug is weakness to flying

118
00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:00,419
so you pop that in

119
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:03,660
we we were flying in as far as no

120
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:07,620
resistance to Flying hole or immune and

121
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:09,360
bug is also Venus to rocks and rock is

122
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,880
already dead so I think it's a rock

123
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,880
count too because so normally normally

124
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:18,360
venuses is times two if so times two of

125
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:21,419
a not neutral amount of damage and but

126
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:24,120
if it's twice a chord weakness

127
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:27,000
it can only happen for dual ties because

128
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:29,340
dual ties have two ties and if those two

129
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,039
dice have one of the same weaknesses

130
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:33,740
it's a chord weakness so if I embark is

131
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:38,100
Rock

132
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:41,639
2v times four and next bug is also

133
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:43,940
winners to fire but fires resistance to

134
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,940
fire

135
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:54,360
which puts it into the neutral section

136
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:56,940
and also bug is also resistant to Grass

137
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:59,520
which makes it which makes it resistance

138
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:02,520
by four times so that's kind of

139
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:05,039
obviously a recording this so I chose

140
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:07,440
this tote in particularly because it has

141
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:10,380
a quad weakness and it also has a

142
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:13,380
resistance so this grass is resisted

143
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:15,360
twice because fire is resistant to grass

144
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:20,220
and bug is also resistance to Grass

145
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,220
which is resisted by twice sidekick

146
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,819
grass

147
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,520
grass is already there yet

148
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:30,300
and dark

149
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:33,060
[Music]

150
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:35,580
yeah so what have you learned today okay

151
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:38,099
the fire type it seems the fire type is

152
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:40,740
very strong right

153
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:42,900
because fire depends everything so who

154
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:44,759
beats the fire

155
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:47,819
uh

156
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:50,759
um water Rock and ground okay so I would

157
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:53,280
look for the uh which were not very

158
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:54,900
effective right so if this is what fire

159
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,180
is not very effective

160
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:59,819
but in Samsung that means that those

161
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:01,800
type speed site can I understand that

162
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:03,240
that way

163
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,599
so

164
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:09,419
so like water in there right so Japan is

165
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:12,720
not very effective against water so it

166
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:15,960
means water is very effective to fire oh

167
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,280
it's not always it's not always so are

168
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:20,280
we done fighting

169
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:23,160
no okay that's good so today is the 13th

170
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:27,419
