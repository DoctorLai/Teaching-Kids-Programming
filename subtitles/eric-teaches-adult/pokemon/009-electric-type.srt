1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:05,339
hello my name is Eric and I'm going to

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:08,820
teach about electric type and so

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:10,740
electric code is kind of if you look

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:14,519
over Electric Touch they're probably

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:18,240
stuff to do with like electric like you

6
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:21,000
usually like Thunderbolts and stuff so

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:25,619
it's weaknesses

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,560
his weakness is ground

9
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:30,180
and that's really it and it's a ground I

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,780
don't know why but I think it's like

11
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:37,380
earthquakes are maybe rattle a socket I

12
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,680
don't know so it's resistance

13
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,680
foreign

14
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:53,520
type is resistant to itself because it's

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,980
the same type not always not always okay

16
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,480
can you give me an example why this is

17
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,940
not the case

18
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:04,160
you know you know in the center like

19
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,160
water is it resistant to water yes

20
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,340
so one of them is ghost ghost is super

21
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,080
effective against each other and also if

22
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:17,700
I think that neutral damage to yourself

23
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:20,119
okay okay thank you electric fly and and

24
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,119
steel

25
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,580
so electric yeah it kind of like I'm

26
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,580
flying like a bird I don't know

27
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,580
electrified

28
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,520
steel because like you know how steel

29
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:39,119
how it comes you can definitely that

30
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:42,540
just say yes yes so yeah so and it's

31
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:46,799
super effective

32
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:50,820
against water and climb yeah if you know

33
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:54,899
like five and sounds like the water for

34
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:57,780
like water conducts electricity well and

35
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:59,640
so like because we're made we have water

36
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,579
inside so that's why we get electric

37
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,259
shocks yes

38
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:07,259
flying I don't know what's good birds

39
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:09,300
and electricity but that's how it just

40
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:12,239
works

41
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:15,920
and it's not very effective

42
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,920
they're effective

43
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,300
okay

44
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,180
not very effective against electric

45
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:26,340
obviously

46
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:29,480
graph

47
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,480
and dragon

48
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:36,840
so

49
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:39,360
so this has been going on as as so this

50
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,440
is like the actual Pokemon like the

51
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,360
actual

52
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,860
the actual Pokemon

53
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,300
okay

54
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:50,940
and and and there's a appointment

55
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:52,319
wait a minute and but this is the

56
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,620
appointment

57
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:57,120
this is a permit

58
00:02:54,620 --> 00:03:00,540
attacking the Pokemon

59
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:03,000
opponent attacking the Pokemon so this

60
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:07,280
is this is this is the Pokemon's

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,280
resistance and the Pokemon's weaknesses

62
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:15,659
would you call it kind of yes so so the

63
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:18,300
weakness and resistance and you notice

64
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:21,780
they might have the same thing so this

65
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:23,580
is where my attacking the Pokemon and

66
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,220
this is a Pokemon's weakness and

67
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:28,459
Pokemon's resistance and what with this

68
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,459
one

69
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:40,739
the Pokemon attacking the appointment so

70
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:42,840
this is what this Pokemon is super

71
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:46,220
effective and this is what is not very

72
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,220
effective against uh let's see

73
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:51,180
so super thank you not very effective

74
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:55,019
and water and we're listening electric

75
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:58,799
is like a very a pretty good type it's

76
00:03:55,019 --> 00:04:00,599
unless if the third referred best

77
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,860
what's the top best

78
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:08,000
deal what's the second dragon

79
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:08,000
what does it look like in a job

80
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:13,700
ah yeah okay okay looks like a chicken

81
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,700
neck

82
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:22,579
but oh you can or you can do uh if we

83
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:22,579
like this better

84
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:29,720
yeah

85
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:29,720
yeah okay okay I see okay

86
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,000
okay so what have you learned today yeah

87
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:39,240
electric type what's next

88
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,220
I think I'm gonna do

89
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:46,100
today I see now we cover the top three

90
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:46,100
best all right yeah thank you thank you
