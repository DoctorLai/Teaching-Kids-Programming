1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,700
hello my name is Eric and I'm going to

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:08,460
teach about fighting type so fighting

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:11,820
type is kind of like the Pokemon which

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:14,580
are like very good at fighting uh you

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:18,420
can look at them and then you can say oh

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:20,279
that's a karate guy so and this fighting

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:25,460
type weakness

8
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:25,460
what does it look like oh it looks like

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:32,759
it kind of looks like that

10
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,700
kind of like that

11
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:39,300
like that I think yeah it's supposed to

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:42,860
be stopping weakness is

13
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,860
is psychic

14
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:46,040
fairy

15
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:54,239
I'm not actually sure why is fighting

16
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,520
being a psychic fairy and falling okay

17
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,920
so this weakness these Pokemons beat

18
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:02,100
fighting it means it kind of has an

19
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,920
advantage it doesn't mean 100 beat okay

20
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,700
and it means like if it uses like a

21
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:11,280
flying time if it does double the damage

22
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:14,640
neutral damage is what it normally does

23
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:18,540
um flying so if it's super effective it

24
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:21,360
does it it doubles it and it says if

25
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,820
it's a chord weakness then what weakness

26
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,340
is for dual type because if both of the

27
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:28,920
types are winning still in a particular

28
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,460
time and then it'll do four times as

29
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,460
much okay

30
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,380
so the fighting is

31
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,880
um resistance

32
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:42,840
to

33
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:47,280
its resistance to bug I think because

34
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:50,880
bugs are small bugs can't do much

35
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,979
same like rock

36
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,479
and dark

37
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:57,540
Rock

38
00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:00,600
so fighting is resistant to rock and

39
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:03,479
dark dark I think I don't know I think

40
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:07,700
they can see me dark or something rock

41
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:07,700
is uh they can punch a rock

42
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:21,599
it's it's super effective against normal

43
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,400
Rock

44
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,120
ice

45
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,120
dark

46
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,420
deal

47
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:41,459
so fighting is a a pretty okay time it's

48
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:43,800
not as as is the only time which is

49
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:45,959
super effective against normal as normal

50
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,720
as when he has a one witness

51
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:52,080
no more it can punch

52
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,540
rock you can punch a rock but I think a

53
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,599
punch your eyes dog he can punch dark

54
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:59,280
steel can kind of Steel I think these

55
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:02,940
fighting type Pokemon are really strong

56
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,940
fists because they can point to steal

57
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:09,800
all right

58
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:09,800
effective let me guess fire

59
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,940
a poison

60
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,940
uh okay yeah we have

61
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,940
um flying

62
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,980
very

63
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:28,099
psychic

64
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,120
and bug

65
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,580
is resistance and nowhere effective so

66
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,080
bug and fighting can't do much against

67
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:40,140
each other I don't know why it's not

68
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:43,440
very effective against Bug for poison it

69
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:46,140
it can't really karate people are not

70
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,239
scientists so what's karate I mean what

71
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:51,720
does it mean it seems like

72
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,280
pancake stuff like that like it's kind

73
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,340
of like a gym for

74
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,360
fighting

75
00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:01,220
karate card is very

76
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,019
k-a-r-a-t-e

77
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:07,379
k-a-r-a-t-e okay I don't know what he

78
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:09,959
means flying I think flying flying I

79
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:12,720
like birth I don't know why birth why

80
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:15,200
birth can do so much against a guy with

81
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,200
Fists

82
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:24,960
yeah but I'm seeing why the birds can do

83
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:28,199
so much damage to the fighting guy fairy

84
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,900
I don't think like fairy is a kind of

85
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:32,759
Pokemon which ones too right but I think

86
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:35,520
I don't know why it's that there and

87
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:40,040
sake is kind of like mind controlling

88
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,040
and also has a no effect

89
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,580
can I remember it from um

90
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,040
what no effect

91
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:53,100
yeah I talked about the time which

92
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:57,180
fighting has no effect on and I love

93
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:59,040
that video it I put immune to fighting I

94
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:03,020
know

95
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:05,699
water no no attack

96
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:08,759
oh okay

97
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:11,580
because you can't punch your ghost I see

98
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:15,000
I mean okay so you never says then

99
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:18,600
not many types come from girls because

100
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,120
it's just like uh non-existent a ghost

101
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,860
type Pokemon and no more and fighting

102
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,020
type moves

103
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,180
so it's an effect because you can't

104
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:29,580
really touch it or punch it but it does

105
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:31,919
it's also different moves like Thunder

106
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:34,680
Punch Thunder Punch is electric I mean

107
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,780
and there's also Fire Punch which is a

108
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,120
fire type move I used to punch which is

109
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:42,660
the ice type move and there's also

110
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:46,320
Shadow punch which is a ghost type move

111
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:49,139
okay and they're also there are 91

112
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:52,340
fighting type Pokemon the fighting type

113
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:56,220
Pokemon have the most average attack

114
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:59,880
stat the average of a fighting type

115
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:02,280
Pokemon stat is the highest I'm not

116
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:04,320
saying like it's on the limit I'm saying

117
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,580
it's higher than the rest yeah okay you

118
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,400
mentioned that yeah because it's

119
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:10,919
fighting yeah yeah for the fighting I

120
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:15,120
think they did all of the fighting type

121
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:19,280
of doctors I I'm just gonna do fire and

122
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,280
fighting so fire

123
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:25,020
if I am fighting fire in the fighting is

124
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:27,139
kind of like

125
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:31,020
um

126
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:33,360
Inferno Inferno is kind of to to get the

127
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:35,580
image of a fine fighting type Pokemon

128
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:40,440
Inferno is a

129
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:44,060
punching ape or monkey with with fire on

130
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:47,280
his head and it's red

131
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:50,039
well not really red not like not like a

132
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:53,460
tomato I think you already know how this

133
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:55,759
works fire is this is nasty fairy so he

134
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:59,220
popped out in the neutral section

135
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:02,960
so it does no more damage like minus one

136
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,960
plus one make zero

137
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,840
it's weakness to five weakness to water

138
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:13,940
so you pop that in

139
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:17,520
fighting is not resistance to water

140
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:20,699
so we pop that in if it was resistant to

141
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:23,460
water we've rubbed water from here and

142
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:26,880
we've popped our neutral section we

143
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:28,740
don't put Rock in because fighting is

144
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:32,099
resistance to rock and the fire's

145
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:34,699
weakness of rocks so minus one plus one

146
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:34,699
zero

147
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,660
whoops

148
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:48,479
is also weighing us to ground as

149
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:51,060
fighting is no resistance to ground and

150
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:54,419
as you see as you've seen forever broken

151
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:57,660
that would happen if fighting was that

152
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:59,880
so he popped that in there the fire is

153
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:03,680
really listen to fire

154
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,680
through this into grass

155
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:09,380
fires also a resistance to bars

156
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:15,720
since fighting and fire are both with

157
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:18,180
the social bug so it does four times

158
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:21,360
less instead of two times for normal

159
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:26,280
resistance the damage divided by two if

160
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:30,000
both of them are resisted by five so

161
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:32,399
this these two are both resist bug so it

162
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,839
does four times less so let's say we

163
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,779
have a bug time move and there's 80

164
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,700
damage then it will turn to 20. okay on

165
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:43,099
a final connecting type

166
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:43,099
so for time to do this

167
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:57,000
is also resistance to ice

168
00:08:52,260 --> 00:09:00,660
also resistance to steel

169
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,220
and I think that's it fires also

170
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,519
resistance to

171
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:09,800
um grass

172
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:09,800
uh eyes oh your eyes is already there

173
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:17,279
do you leave us there

174
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:20,180
is anger I already figured them

175
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,180
oh yeah bug

176
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:32,580
three for for fighting fighting is a

177
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:36,000
good count for steel and steel is I I

178
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:39,000
think is one of the I think it has the

179
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,120
highest average defense

180
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,660
so fighting is a good counter for steel

181
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:49,339
it can super effect all of these I'm not

182
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:49,339
sure if there's a word so

183
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:57,600
so for dual type

184
00:09:54,300 --> 00:10:00,240
for super effect super Effectiveness and

185
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,640
and not very effect is is a different

186
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,640
thing to weakness and resistance because

187
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:09,300
a Venus resistance is uh kind of like

188
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,320
like I said the body of a Pokemon or

189
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:13,680
Pokemon

190
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:16,560
being hit by the move this is

191
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:19,680
it's using the move

192
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:22,860
using the moon yeah

193
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:25,740
so to make this clear it says super

194
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:28,200
effective and not very effective is to

195
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:31,140
do with the move like what how the

196
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,880
Pokemon attacks so if I Pokemon attacks

197
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:35,160
or an ice type it will be super

198
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,920
effective and when it attacks aov not

199
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:40,800
very effectively gone fair so for dual

200
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,660
type it's hard to put that because one

201
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,700
time I'd be super effective one time

202
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:48,060
might be not very effective so it's

203
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:51,000
basically your choice of what move do

204
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:53,399
you use okay I thought you become

205
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,740
neutral if there is one type for

206
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:58,820
Humanity yeah yeah that's that's what

207
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,820
this doesn't

208
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,899
because that's a body you can't change

209
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,959
your body

210
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:12,600
ah okay yeah but but this you can choose

211
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:15,060
which attack do you use

212
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,519
this is kind of Defending you on you if

213
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:19,079
you use a fighting or fire or or

214
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:22,079
whatever so

215
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:24,899
you can choose one at a time right yeah

216
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:28,320
so and and the Pokemon can at most

217
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:30,839
Remember full moves if it says it wants

218
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,060
to learn a new move if you want it you

219
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:35,519
can replace the move by by the Pokemon

220
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:39,200
forgetting one move and learning a new

221
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:42,899
move okay so move is a skill

222
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,579
it's like casting a sphere

223
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:46,680
what kind of movie what can you give me

224
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:50,399
example what movie is that there's a lot

225
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:55,500
of the news like let's say let's say um

226
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:58,500
psychic earthquake oh yeah okay okay

227
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:01,800
so the move the different Pokemons have

228
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:05,100
different moves right yeah sometimes

229
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,800
they have the same move if it depends on

230
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:10,079
what they can learn but

231
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:12,320
not all of the Pokemon can learn all of

232
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:16,079
the moves

233
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:18,660
that each Hero has a four or five skills

234
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,760
and you can learn the heroes can learn

235
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:22,920
the skills customers there there's a

236
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:26,279
physical damage there's a magical damage

237
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:29,220
the impact on the special special and

238
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:33,240
physical physical is making contact and

239
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:34,860
and a special is is like arranged I saw

240
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,019
you at the other day the sniper the

241
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:39,060
Delta with the oh it's a gun yeah and

242
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:41,459
then it's a range attack right similar

243
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:43,380
okay okay good that's interesting yeah I

244
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:44,940
should play the Pokemon some other day

245
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:46,440
because it really seems really

246
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:50,120
interesting to me

247
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:53,339
how hard it is to learn how to play this

248
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:56,639
it kind of depends on how quick you

249
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:59,940
learn it since the um lots lots of types

250
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:02,600
and lots of parts to it so I'm not sure

251
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:05,399
how long I think it will be

252
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:08,700
pretty long how many a thousand eight

253
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:11,160
and eight wow that's a lot yeah that's

254
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:13,440
really a lot I can't even memorize that

255
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,899
much do you feel like I can't remember

256
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,180
all of them but but when you mentioned

257
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:21,360
it and then I remember it all of them

258
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:24,420
are in my head so if you say it so if

259
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,579
you kind of say oh I'll name some

260
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:29,040
psychic and fairy type pokemon I'll name

261
00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:31,320
some but I can't remember all of all of

262
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,360
them okay so they are a thousand and

263
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:35,279
eight Pokemon but they are only 18

264
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,279
Pokemon types

265
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:41,339
yeah and they are two types that they

266
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:43,620
can you can mix too okay a thousand and

267
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:46,019
eight Pokemons there are some are due

268
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:49,740
type right yeah and some are singles I

269
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:52,800
see okay stuff like yes fire just

270
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:54,779
fighting I see I see okay okay so that's

271
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,540
good okay so what have you learned today

272
00:13:54,779 --> 00:14:00,000
okay so ladies are fighting and you say

273
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:02,459
they are 91 Pokemon which are fighting

274
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,220
right yeah and then it seems a pretty

275
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:07,500
okay in terms of ranking where it fits

276
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:11,940
in a ranking paper it's the last time

277
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:13,500
the most strongest type is still is it

278
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:17,459
still yeah okay

279
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:20,459
so roughly which place number

280
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:22,920
I think it's 12. okay so it's just in

281
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:25,279
the winter it's kind of like yeah it's

282
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,279
kind of like

283
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:31,320
a two-thirds so what's next so we have

284
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,060

um

288
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,839
yeah I think we haven't talked about it

289
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,480
I have to check like this but the locker

290
