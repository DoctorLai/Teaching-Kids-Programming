1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:05,520
hello my name is Eric I'm going to teach

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:08,760
you about psychic type but if I can't

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:12,059
type is an okay time it's kind of made a

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:17,160
leak I don't know because and it's

5
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:19,440
sweetness is um let's see oh yes bug

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,439
okay

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,900
and dark

8
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,420
okay the sidekick is something like

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:30,779
light or something it's like basically

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:33,300
mind controlling and light so kind of

11
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:38,300
like that I like fagot

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,300
um so it's super effective

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:44,280
but

14
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:47,760
psychic is like a person who is uh crazy

15
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:51,899
crazy person the person like can mind

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:55,739
control like for example in in the book

17
00:00:51,899 --> 00:01:00,620
Matilda Roald Dahl it I think she has

18
00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:00,620
like psychic powers oh I see okay

19
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:10,619
and fighting

20
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:13,740
oh okay fighting like a psychic I think

21
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:17,420
you can mind control and like and

22
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,420
you also have no effect

23
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:25,920
okay effect on dark

24
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,920
uh yeah because this weakness to dark

25
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,580
okay I didn't imagine this yeah because

26
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:37,159
my mind control like with like Darkness

27
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:37,159
or kind of thing so oh yeah resistance

28
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:46,159
resistance is a

29
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:46,159
is psychic

30
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:53,520
and fighting you can't really it doesn't

31
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:56,060
do much if if you like

32
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,399
psychic one another that that's

33
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:02,340
resistance like it's it's not very

34
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:06,020
effective against each other both types

35
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:09,599
both ways that's normally what what most

36
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:11,819
majority of types are I see come here

37
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:15,239
and the

38
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:16,920
and were not very effective on not

39
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:19,319
effective

40
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:22,040
not very

41
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:22,040
effective

42
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:27,840
they're less types today than the

43
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,020
previous one I remember in the previous

44
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:34,250
video you well you put out something in

45
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,879
different types yeah you know

46
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:38,580
[Music]

47
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:41,340
it it said to be like the best type it

48
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:42,959
has load of defenses the difference is

49
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:46,860
it kind of

50
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:48,840
it's kind of neutral it doesn't deem so

51
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:51,200
it normally doesn't do much damage

52
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,200
against

53
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:58,220
one two three four five six seven eight

54
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:06,379
ah yeah

55
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,379
and we have ten types of neutral I see

56
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:11,099
because Steel

57
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:13,319
and psychic

58
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:17,879
steel and psychic type is something like

59
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:20,040
Metagross Metagross is like on coding on

60
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:23,099
coding last time we talked about the

61
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,580
table and one of them was Metagross oh

62
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:28,739
okay you'll remember okay

63
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:31,879
it's really good type combination

64
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:34,560
so still

65
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:38,659
Okay so

66
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:42,180
so it's not lean is too dark anymore

67
00:03:38,659 --> 00:03:46,379
in a neutral section okay

68
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:52,459
because steel is resistancy dog so so

69
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:52,459
like if you even out it makes it a bug

70
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:57,319
okay okay

71
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:04,739
uh

72
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:07,319
good steel is also weenies to fire oh

73
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:09,840
look around so we add that on since

74
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:12,780
psychic isn't resistance to firing

75
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,299
ground so if you put them at but it's

76
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,579
also weenies to fighting but since it's

77
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:20,579
resistance we wrote that off and then

78
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:23,759
put it in so you can combine the

79
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:26,120
different Pokemon types and then we put

80
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:30,440
a load on here okay I

81
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,440
so so we put

82
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,380
dragon

83
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:38,040
Rock

84
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,880
Steel

85
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,880
grass

86
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:52,880
you don't put bug Virgo duck so we have

87
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,880
what else is there oh yeah very

88
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,440
and um

89
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:05,220
like I think it's okay there's a load of

90
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:08,699
different defenses from steel and it's

91
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:10,139
not very effective against

92
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:15,380
steel is

93
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:15,380
so too effective left foot Rock

94
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:19,340
and ice

95
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:29,100
oh okay so we also have this four times

96
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,100
resistance

97
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:38,280
which means it's resisted by four times

98
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:43,979
so when that happens it's like this not

99
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:46,500
very so that so resistance is to psychic

100
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:51,120
so I give a Stealers both of them are

101
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:55,020
resistant to say to remove that out and

102
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:57,060
put it there and it's not not very

103
00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:00,240
effective on

104
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:03,060
steel is not very effective against

105
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,100
also another effect is gonna steal so if

106
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:08,300
that's already there so you did so can

107
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,300
you draw a psychic type

108
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:26,360
okay it's I yeah I see okay good

109
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,360
that's great okay

110
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:31,919
okay so the psychic is like a person

111
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:34,259
looking to this mind reading right yeah

112
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,520
okay thank you okay so what's the next

113
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:38,280
one next week

114
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,800
I think it's gonna be

115
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:44,300
um normal okay okay thank you thank you

116
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,300
