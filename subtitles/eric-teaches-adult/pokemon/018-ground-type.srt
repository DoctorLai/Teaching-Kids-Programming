[Music]

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:15,719
oh yeah yeah

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:18,139
so it's Salinas what does it look like

4
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:18,139
it's like

5
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:31,980
water and ice

6
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:37,380
I think grass because like you can plant

7
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:39,059
plant it at Water you can moisture and

8
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,980
ice freeze

9
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:44,120
okay last week we talked about grass

10
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:46,739
across the weakness is it is it weakness

11
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,420
I see okay okay that's super effective

12
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:50,520
and weakness

13
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,379
you can pay us right yeah like like I

14
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,780
say like grass is super effective

15
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:57,420
against the ground it's the same same

16
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:00,539
ground as weakness to grasp if

17
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:03,500
resistance is a rock

18
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:03,500
and poison

19
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:08,820
Rook I think it can carry Rock and I

20
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,760
don't know why poisoned because maybe

21
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:15,720
you can pop with them and it doesn't

22
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:18,180
and it's immune to Electric I think

23
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:21,479
electric because you can't really uh

24
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:25,020
electric can't do any damage to a ground

25
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:29,720
so this is ground it's not a lot here

26
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,720
and it's super effective

27
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:36,140
milk

28
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,740
deal poison

29
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:43,340

foreign

32
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,420
weakness

33
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,640
and it is not very effective

34
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,060
they're not very effective against the

35
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:14,959
grass

36
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,959
and bug

37
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,700
and as an effect

38
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,840
and flying

39
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:29,580
and I don't think I'm flying because it

40
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:33,000
flies that doesn't really need

41
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:35,640
explanation and like always

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,420
every Pokemon has a weakness there's no

43
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:41,940
light if a Pokemon is weakness to a

44
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:44,580
specific type then it's bad because

45
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:46,980
every Pokemon has weaknesses and

46
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:49,860
resistance like this you can see it's

47
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:52,140
very powerful and these two types are

48
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:54,300
one of the most weakest types and ground

49
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:56,400
is not very effective against them

50
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,920
the steel is a

51
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,040
strongest type in the game with DC

52
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,599
Harbor most weakest type in the game and

53
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,519
the ground is nowhere effective and the

54
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:09,060
super effective against that

55
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:11,220
see sometimes my arm needs one of those

56
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:14,700
toys because like ground is number 50

57
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:18,019
videos like every type has a wenis and

58
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,019
grass is a good one for ground

59
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:25,920
is in first place for most highest

60
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:28,580
defense average and the 89 Grand Pokemon

61
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,580
ringer

62
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:34,580
I'm gonna show you a steel and ground

63
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:45,780
once you ground the Pokemon is Steelix

64
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:49,680
Steelix uh is basically a kind of

65
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:51,739
snake made out of rocks which is made

66
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,299
out of steel

67
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:56,159
okay and

68
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:58,280
so

69
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,280
um

70
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,920
Steel

71
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,920
if

72
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,680
that's my hard drive don't worry about

73
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:09,680
it

74
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:21,799
so both of those

75
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:29,400
go there like if it's one that's

76
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:30,900
weakness one type is resisted then it

77
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,680
becomes neutral

78
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:38,220
steel is weakness to um fire but ground

79
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:41,639
it doesn't resist fire so we put it here

80
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:43,919
if ground was resisted by fire it will

81
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:45,419
be here and we will rub that off and and

82
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,479
then we put it there

83
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:50,820
let's see steel is also been up to

84
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:53,460
fighting the ground both of those tires

85
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:56,840
are not resisted by ground so you put

86
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,840
put them both there

87
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:03,960
they're feeling ground type is is one

88
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:07,860
instagram ground is one of those types

89
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:09,660
that is not resisted by each other so if

90
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,120
you see a steel and ground type of his

91
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:17,220
wieners stick around

92
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:19,860
and if steel is resistant to normal

93
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:24,500
we put that there

94
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:24,500
is this in to flying

95
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,900
Steelers resistors

96
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,900
psychic

97
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,919
also releases it

98
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,880
um bug

99
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:37,880
fairy

100
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,060
dragon

101
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,600
and a steel

102
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:55,979
that's what I listen to still has a lot

103
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:58,380
of resistances so that makes it a good

104
00:05:55,979 --> 00:06:02,460
dual type to pair up with which can

105
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:05,340
cover a lot of uh weaknesses and also

106
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:07,520
still is immune to poison so we put that

107
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,520
there

108
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:15,259
so this is what steering ground looks

109
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:19,440
like so there's also a disability

110
00:06:15,259 --> 00:06:21,780
levitate of levitate there's also in

111
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:25,199
Pokemon there's abilities which can

112
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:27,360
which you like for example the levitate

113
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,660
ability

114
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,600
makes it immune to ground

115
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:36,300
so if the Pokemon had levitate then it

116
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:40,259
will be immune to ground immune can get

117
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:42,780
you forgotten immune means you're you're

118
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:45,360
you're able to like avoid the attacker

119
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:48,600
like right resist the damage and it

120
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:51,120
always become zero damage if I said oh

121
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,639
I'm immune to you if you attack me then

122
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,139
it will do zero damage no matter no

123
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:57,840
matter what you did it will do zero

124
00:06:55,139 --> 00:07:00,000
damage like let's say earthquake to move

125
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,039
with the Pokemon with levitating it'll

126
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,280
do zero damage so desserts have a

127
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:09,000
concept of the Pokemon dying and respond

128
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:12,139
thing if it takes too much damage

129
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,139
Pokemon died

130
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:22,500
Pokemon at the time no like many at once

131
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:25,800
the maximum you can carry is six Pokemon

132
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:28,500
in your party it's called party party

133
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,660
which is the basically your Pokemon team

134
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:34,199
your Pokemon team is called your party

135
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:36,120
and if a Pokemon has fainted you can

136
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:38,580
send out another Pokemon

137
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:41,220
you could send out another Pokemon and

138
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:44,099
also there's different things you can do

139
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:47,819
in a battle you can fight you can switch

140
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:51,440
out to another Pokemon you can heal a

141
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:54,539
Pokemon by using an item from your bag

142
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:57,900
and that's basically it sometimes you

143
00:07:54,539 --> 00:08:01,080
can run away from a battle for like a

144
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:03,780
wild Pokemon you just run away and from

145
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,919
your back you have potions potions which

146
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:08,099
he will like

147
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:11,580
a specific amount like a person I think

148
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:15,419
it does 20 super Pokemon 60 and Hyper

149
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:18,960
potion 120 and there's also antidote

150
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:22,259
which can heal poisoning

151
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:26,099
there's a ice heel which can heal

152
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:27,780
freezing like if you're Frozen you if

153
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:29,639
one of your Pokemon is Frozen then you

154
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,660
can use an IP landed and then you'll

155
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:34,260
fall out

156
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:36,839
and also there's this item revive which

157
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:39,959
you can put on the Pokemon and a fainted

158
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:41,940
Pokemon and then your respawn but it

159
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:44,580
wouldn't go too Max Health it'll be like

160
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,380
half and there's also Max revive like

161
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:48,360
you can put them on the Pokemon and then

162
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:51,300
they will restore to full health there's

163
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:55,200
also this move in I think it's

164
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:59,459
introduced in year 9 which is a new gen

165
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:02,279
uh which I think is like there's this

166
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:06,240
Pokemon called Hound Stone which is the

167
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:09,540
ghost dog and it has um it didn't move

168
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,940
which is called last respect and it does

169
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,380
the amount of damage depending on how

170
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,779
much Pokemon

171
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:19,380
of your party has died

172
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:21,060
hasn't been fated so let's say zero

173
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:24,839
Pokemon have been fated then you'll do

174
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:27,300
50 damage and if all five Pokemon the

175
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:29,959
maximum is five Pokemon has been fainted

176
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:33,720
because the maximum is six and

177
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:37,080
houndstone can't be fainted to use the

178
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:39,959
move so the maximum is five and which

179
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:42,120
will do uh and if all of your Pokemon

180
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:45,120
has been painted a step on a hamster

181
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:48,260
then you use last respects then you'll

182
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,260
do 300 damage

183
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:53,399
so what have you learned today the

184
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,100
ground type the last type so we cover

185
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:57,779
all the types so what's next okay so

186
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,339
we're going to talk about the Mega

187
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:03,980
Evolutions

188
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:03,980
what's it about it's about every

189
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,600
into another Pokemon and then you can

190
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:17,760
evolve again and then sometimes there's

191
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,380
a Pokemon which can't evolve and

192
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,140
sometimes they put one with any two

193
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:24,300
evolutions and sometimes it was free and

194
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:27,899
sometimes we have a different Choice

195
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:29,540
like depending like let's say Evie has

196
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:32,940
eight different

197
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:38,040
eight different Evolutions he can evolve

198
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:40,500
to any of them and you and to evolve to

199
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:42,959
evolve it you can you have to do a

200
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:46,500
specific thing like level up to like

201
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:50,040
let's say 40 I don't know use a use a

202
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:54,200
stone and maybe level up level bar

203
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:56,579
30 night time maybe trade maybe Stones

204
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:59,220
evolutionary stones

205
00:10:56,579 --> 00:11:00,600
okay good okay so looking forward to it

206
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,760

207
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:06,980
Evolution will come from monkeys okay

208
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,980
