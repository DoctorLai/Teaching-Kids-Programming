1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,740
hello everyone I'm Derek and I'm going

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,540
to teach about Pokemon Mega Evolution

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,580
so

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:12,240
so normally in Pokemon there's there's

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:14,160
Evolution country is like how we evolved

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,580
from monkeys

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,619
do we yeah okay yeah monkeys evolved

8
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,800
into humans

9
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:25,740
so like evolution is permanent like we

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:29,460
can't turn back to monkeys

11
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:31,920
in only for evolution you have to to

12
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,739
evolve you have to come like mostly it's

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,800
mostly you have to to evolve yeah I have

14
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:40,620
to do like something like like it's

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,800
mostly a level like if you're this

16
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:46,500
certain level you will evolve but you

17
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,260
always can stop the evolution you also

18
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,960
can stop the evolution from happening by

19
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,239
pressing the B button from the remote

20
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,520
control or not anyway I'm not telling

21
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,739
you how to play a video game I'm just

22
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:02,280
telling you how it really works

23
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:04,440
and you also can let a person a voice

24
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,479
every two people normally do you

25
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:09,900
evolveware Pokemon it gets stronger and

26
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,119
then it has the higher stats and and

27
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,400
then you can learn more moves and then

28
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:17,760
it comes more powerful but you also can

29
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,520
put some like high friendship you also

30
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,619
can involve but also you have to evolve

31
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,320
Pokemon by high friendship you don't

32
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:29,759
have to evolve a Pokemon with birthday

33
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:34,680
but and four Pokemon like Eevee Evie can

34
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:37,439
evolve into a to different forms so far

35
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:41,700
it can evolve to Flareon Jolteon

36
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:45,180
Vaporeon Leafeon Glaceon espion

37
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:47,759
Umbreon and Sylveon each have a

38
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:50,820
different type

39
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:54,000
it only can evolve into one of them or

40
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:56,220
you can not let it evolve

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,840
so like I said you don't have to evolve

42
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:00,899
with Pokemon let's see in the generation

43
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:04,259
like let's say this this Pokemon like

44
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:06,960
Onyx and and Onyx was uh had no

45
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:09,239
Evolution you also can get Pokemon which

46
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,440
doesn't evolve and doesn't have any

47
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:12,780
evolution

48
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,459
so it just stays as it is and in

49
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:18,080
generation one it didn't have any

50
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:21,120
Evolution and in Gen 2 they added

51
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:24,540
Steelix which was a

52
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,940
Steelix which was onyx's evolution is

53
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:29,640
like it when I was talking about ground

54
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:31,260
type I was using the example Steelix if

55
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,680
you remember I'm not sure if you

56
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:37,920
remember that but now you do yeah and

57
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:41,580
also you can have a Pokemon there's this

58
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:45,060
item called evolite you can put it on a

59
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:47,879
Pokemon which can evolve which can

60
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:50,340
evolve which hasn't evolved

61
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:52,260
to its final stage

62
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:55,080
and you're comfortable another problem

63
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:57,360
with no Evolution and and then you read

64
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,519
the special defense of a defense of a

65
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,500
Pokemon which can still evolve

66
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:05,640
okay

67
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:08,640
so so for media Evolution Mega Evolution

68
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:12,540
is temporary so the first formica

69
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:16,319
Evolution you need a keystone and the

70
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:19,319
mega evolution stone with it so one

71
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:21,900
thing is this is a trainer

72
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:25,260
and this is a Pokemon

73
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:26,519
how do I make it more like a yes a

74
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:29,879
trainer

75
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:33,260
hat with a Pokeball

76
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:33,260
and a backpack

77
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:37,560
the key thing is they're Pokeball right

78
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,159
whoever gets their book cover become a

79
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,159
trainer if

80
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:50,760
and as a Pokemon Pokemon is actually not

81
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:53,819
like that so this trainer

82
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:57,500
has to have a keystone

83
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:57,500
it kind of looks like this

84
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:05,099
is an item you have to have it like in

85
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:07,860
its back any Pokemon can have a can hold

86
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:11,159
only one item

87
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:13,920
Pokemon only can hold one item or zero

88
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:16,320
items for Pokemon to mega evolved the

89
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:19,680
trainer needs a keystone and and the

90
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,959
Pokemon needs a mega evolutionary stuff

91
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,540
stand you have to hold the diamond get

92
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:28,979
evolutionary stone that Pokemon must

93
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:31,740
hold uh hold a stone which is kind of

94
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:34,020
like this

95
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:36,300
it doesn't really look any different but

96
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:39,479
this one this one has color and that one

97
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:42,800
doesn't well it supposedly has color

98
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:42,800
well the color thing

99
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:53,040
for coffee this is kind of like a marble

100
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:56,699
well it's not actually a marble so this

101
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,740
Stone this Stone there's other Stones

102
00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:01,620
there's different stones and this

103
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:03,720
Pokemon has to have its own Stone you

104
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:05,639
can't give it another Pokemon's Mega

105
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,979
evolutionary Stone and because it

106
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:10,979
wouldn't work so let's say this Pokemon

107
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:13,919
was um let's see

108
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:16,860
what's easy to draw

109
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:21,020
a b Grill

110
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:21,020
V drill is basically a bee

111
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:34,220
like that

112
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,220
if antennas

113
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:42,180
filling point is this has a stone kind

114
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:45,380
of like as a stone with like kind of

115
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:45,380
purpley outside

116
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,039
this part is purple and this has like

117
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:53,460
black

118
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:54,539
and this line in the middle is yellow is

119
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:57,900
for that

120
00:05:54,539 --> 00:06:01,500
is for that Pokemon is a bibra

121
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:04,639
and let's see let's take another Pokemon

122
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,639
um we can take a Gengar

123
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:09,840
foreign

124
00:06:06,979 --> 00:06:11,940
like that I'm not talking about like the

125
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:15,440
drawing I'm talking about the Mega

126
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:19,259
Evolution so this guy have

127
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:22,139
uh also has a standard like purpley

128
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:24,419
outside I think it's more blue and this

129
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:27,180
guy also has a

130
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:29,460
right inside ever had they had red

131
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:32,759
inside instead of yellow you can't give

132
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:34,979
this Gengar has to hold this to to Mega

133
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:37,800
Evolve and this has to hold this to Mega

134
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:40,319
Evolve this Pokemon has to hold this hit

135
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,600
this and this trainer has a whole disc

136
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:46,139
but you can't give a Beedrill a Gengar

137
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:49,319
up Ginger right and you can't give a

138
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:52,139
Gengar a big relied

139
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:55,080
that's what the mega evolutionary stones

140
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:57,319
are called it is normally called with an

141
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,319
eye

142
00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:02,400
so this is a bigger light and that's a

143
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:04,860
Gengar right so you have to hold this

144
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,860
when the mega evolves you only can make

145
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:09,720
it evolve one Pokemon in the battle you

146
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:12,419
can't evolve two Pokemon

147
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,400
Mega Evolve two Pokemon because I think

148
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:16,500
it's because of this Keystone

149
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,800
and when you make a Volvo if that's

150
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:21,479
increased which makes it very which it

151
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,780
makes it even more powerful and it has

152
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:27,479
and it's mostly have different abilities

153
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:29,759
I think they only have one ability for

154
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:31,979
Pokemon sometimes they they can have

155
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,259
more than one ability and it has to have

156
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:37,740
one ability it's like a chance to have

157
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:40,080
disability and turns it has disability

158
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:42,300
so Mega Evolve problems have different

159
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:46,199
abilities and mega evolved Pokemon has

160
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:49,440
like one one like Gengar make a Gengar

161
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:52,680
have Shadow tag which prevents the

162
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,940
problem from switching or which is like

163
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:57,539
fleeing

164
00:07:53,940 --> 00:08:00,840
and this mega b Grill has

165
00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:03,599
um adaptability which makes the moves

166
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:06,300
moves of its same type powerful if you

167
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:08,940
don't understand like this video is a

168
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:11,520
bug and poison type so it will boost the

169
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:13,560
bug and poison type moves in the battle

170
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,300
you also can return your mega evolution

171
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:18,300
and send it out and it will still be

172
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:20,759
mega evolved and like some other things

173
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:23,039
like down next Pokemon when you return

174
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:24,960
Dino Pokemon and then you send the

175
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:28,440
number and then eventually you send it

176
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:30,479
out again and then it won't have uh it

177
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,039
won't be dominant ax when you make a

178
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,260
bowl of Pokemon it's always going to get

179
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:37,140
involved in the battle but after the

180
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:38,880
battle a good one goes back to its

181
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:41,399
original form

182
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,020
so it is temporary

183
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:45,420
so

184
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:48,000
if you have any questions okay so that

185
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:50,700
Visa evolution is that it's permanent so

186
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,519
in the game Pokemon I mean is it also

187
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:56,880
prominent no for the Mega Evolution is

188
00:08:53,519 --> 00:09:01,339
temporary uh okay so what is spoken

189
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,339
other Evolution like like this is

190
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:09,000
when they put on the balls it needs to

191
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:12,180
like go up to this level evolutionary

192
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,279
Stone high friendship or have to use

193
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:17,399
just moves at certain times

194
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:21,080
and that's kind of like any other stuff

195
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:21,080
it needs to have a nervous

196
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:27,180
Weedle

197
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,980
looks like a caterpillar yeah yeah it is

198
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:31,440
a caterpillar okay

199
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:35,040
and and then because this is the B and

200
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:38,399
this and this is a cocoon

201
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,880
and it's called cocoon Weedle Kakuna and

202
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,880
region

203
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:50,100
if this is supposed to be a cooking I

204
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:55,519
think it's like level five elbow

205
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:55,519
I think and this is level 10.

206
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,620
perfect

207
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:04,320
so it also can stop it

208
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:07,080
you can let a Pokemon evolve and you can

209
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,880
and you can stop an evolution you don't

210
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:12,060
have to evolve a Pokemon if you want to

211
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:14,760
so you can stop it

212
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:16,380
it's not like you have to have to evolve

213
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,839
a Pokemon when it's on the evolution

214
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:22,320
let's go it says oh

215
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:24,540
okay your what is like what when your

216
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,240
Pokemon is evolving whatever Pokemon is

217
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:29,880
evolving and and then this says

218
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:34,200
something like congratulations deal

219
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:37,320
your Pokemon evolves into a wild Pokemon

220
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:39,740
is it like the level up thing yes it's

221
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,740
not always

222
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:47,300
and then it's

223
00:10:55,019 --> 00:11:05,279
so there's something is like level 25.

224
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:07,459
25 I think and this is you have to trade

225
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,459
foreign

226
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:33,959
between you there's two people playing

227
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:36,300
playing the game or like console to play

228
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:38,579
a Pokemon game and then you trade and

229
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:40,860
then you'll have to try to do a Haunter

230
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:44,459
and then wherever Haunter has been

231
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:47,160
traded the other person who has been

232
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:51,899
trading with you for haunted will evolve

233
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:56,519
there's also evolutionary stones

234
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:56,519
so like Evie

235
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:05,760
this Evie I'm just going to draw his

236
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:08,279
face finally so it can evolve into eight

237
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,260
different forms for

238
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:14,339
each stove

239
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:16,260
there's a firestone uh Thunderstone and

240
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:20,000
a water stone

241
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:20,000
is for the First Republic

242
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:30,560
for Firestone Evie is a normal type and

243
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:30,560
full Varian is gonna be a fire type

244
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:37,459
is a fire type Pokemon

245
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:47,519
a fire type and then fire time which is

246
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:51,660
called Flareon water type from a water

247
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:56,040
stone uh electric type of electric from

248
00:12:51,660 --> 00:13:00,959
the forgotion for um Leafeon you need to

249
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:03,899
level up near a Morsi Rock I think I

250
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:06,600
bought a Glaceon you need you need to

251
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:08,940
level up near uh icy Rock

252
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:11,940
for espion you need to have high

253
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:13,980
friendship in the daytime which is a

254
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:17,040
psychic type refill in the grass type

255
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:19,260
and Glacier only the eyesight and what

256
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,120
I'm really need is a dark type and you

257
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:22,320
need to have high friendship in the

258
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,980
night

259
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:29,160
for uh Sylveon you have to have high

260
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:31,740
friendship while knowing a fairy timing

261
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:33,600
fairytale means that Evie can learn is

262
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:37,200
like baby doll eyes

263
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:39,720
I feel like charm I think I'm not sure

264
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:43,139
if I can learn playgraph so if you want

265
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:45,660
to like to Umbreon your Eevee mustn't

266
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:47,880
have a fairy time moves always it will

267
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:50,519
automatically go to seal field instead

268
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:54,540
of Umbreon

269
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:57,000
and if you want to roll to Espeon

270
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:59,959
you need to have high friendship without

271
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:05,300
a fairy time with always it goes through

272
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:08,940
Silverado instead of svl ambiance

273
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:11,220
so what we learned today Mega Evolutions

274
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:14,579
this is something new so all Pokemons

275
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:17,120
can make a Evolution right this is

276
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:17,120
temporary

277
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:26,100
I mean like some Pokemon can ever evolve

278
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:29,459
and you need uh this another thing yeah

279
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:30,779
obviously and who can initiate these

280
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:33,180
process

281
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:37,139
the trainers all the Pokemons can do

282
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:39,959
make a evil yeah the trainer has to have

283
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:43,019
a keystone and just have to have their

284
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:45,800
own like this means this beef will need

285
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:49,320
to visualize to forget this mirror again

286
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:51,959
it's called The Beatles

287
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,880
okay they have to have both like if this

288
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:55,740
beedro didn't have a beetro light then

289
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:58,139
then it wouldn't work

290
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,579
then it wouldn't make a wall and you

291
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:01,560
have to find it didn't have a keystone

292
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:03,839
then it wouldn't work okay so in the

293
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:07,260
process of Mega Evolution can it be

294
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:09,060
interrupted or cannot be abandoned in a

295
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:11,579
in a meter weight

296
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:13,320
no no I want to say it's initialized it

297
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:16,040
has to finish

298
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:20,040
and can it reverse I mean

299
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:23,399
no it can't it can't reverse you

300
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:25,139
it goes back to its original form after

301
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:27,180
the battle

302
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:29,579
when you mega evolving Pokemon in a

303
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:30,720
battle it's always Megan evolved in the

304
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:33,839
battle

305
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,519
and and after the battle it'll go back

306
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,920
to his original I see that's why it's

307
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:42,019
temporary okay

308
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,019
okay thank you thank you bye-bye
