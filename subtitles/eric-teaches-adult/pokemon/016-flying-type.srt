1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,460
hello my name is Eric and I'm gonna

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:07,980
teach uh flying types flying types are

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:11,519
like birds and basically

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:14,160
things that are wings I think all of the

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,260
entire Pokemon can fly you can't have

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,539
wings I mean and not necessarily fly

7
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,580
like like a penguin

8
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:24,380
so I thought okay it's a penguins

9
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,380
there's no fries so it's not a fried

10
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:31,640
there's like ostriches and they're

11
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,480
flying type where they can't fly so it's

12
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,620
[Music]

13
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,620
two Electric

14
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,579
eyes

15
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,579
Rock

16
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:48,600
this and that's it

17
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:50,940
so for electric I think it paralyzes the

18
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,320
eyes that can freeze it

19
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,739
lock

20
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,739
you can throw the lock to it yeah it's

21
00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:00,539
resistant to grass

22
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:03,500
bug

23
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:03,500
I'm fighting

24
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,320
I've been Grass Grows something like a

25
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,939
bug if I couldn't do much and fighting

26
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,720
fighting is on the ground

27
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:18,680
and also has immunity

28
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,680
to ground

29
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,720
as ground can do anything to find

30
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,700
because it flies in the air like for

31
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,619
example groundhog you because the

32
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:32,040
earthquake and earthquake doesn't look

33
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:34,340
like pets flying types it's super

34
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,340
effective

35
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:41,939
against the grass bug

36
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,340
I think it's the same as resistance it's

37
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:46,979
super effective

38
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:50,000
basically the same it's not like it's

39
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:50,000
strange or anything

40
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:56,960
because this is like my Pokemon

41
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,960
like the Pokemon

42
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:03,720
and this is the appointment

43
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,960
and then this is this is all you need to

44
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,960
know

45
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:13,260
if the payment is attacking you this is

46
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,959
all you really need to know oh and that

47
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:18,599
too but this is the opposite this is

48
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:20,700
like the user attacking the

49
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:23,940
Pokemon but you've got choices because

50
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:26,459
you got more than one move so you can

51
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,959
choose your move that's kind of how you

52
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:30,739
win

53
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:30,739
I see

54
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,860
not very effective

55
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,340
Electric

56
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,560
Steel

57
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:44,099
and Rock

58
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:47,120
it can't do damage to Rock still

59
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:50,519
and electric and there's

60
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,959
132 friends have Pokemon right now so

61
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:56,300
there's a lot

62
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:56,300
how many in the Pokemon you like

63
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:01,660
[Music]

64
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:07,379
they only total 46 right in Pokemon

65
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:10,620
United they're all together is it yeah I

66
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:14,519
think so okay

67
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:15,959
and and also trying to

68
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:17,879
highest

69
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:23,040
speed

70
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:27,120
yeah yeah of course it's right yeah

71
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:29,580
so I do type I'm gonna do is flying in

72
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,000
the seal but if you in case you can't

73
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:36,000
imagine the flying on Steel type Pokemon

74
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,599
uh I'll go live through a fun type I'm

75
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,280
still tired is covering there's

76
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,280
um there's a Quebec night

77
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:50,420
okay sounds like coffee that 19th

78
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:55,640
okay

79
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:55,640
and they're both dealer see

80
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,379
Ryan's theater is this camera I'm just a

81
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:04,400
little girl's coming is the kind of like

82
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:04,400
a bird

83
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,500
okay a steel book yeah it's basically

84
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,500
still bad

85
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:22,320
okay so it doesn't matter so

86
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,979
look at this

87
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:29,060
so is weakness to electric ice rock I'll

88
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:29,060
just put it right back there

89
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:37,139
still it really listens to ice and rock

90
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:39,120
so we get rid of that okay by the way

91
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:41,040
still frying is the same as frying still

92
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,620
right it's just different way of telling

93
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,020
it yeah okay

94
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:49,380
and we put that there so it does normal

95
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:54,199
damage and steel is resistance to normal

96
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:54,199
so you put that there oh no yeah

97
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:04,280
hey

98
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,280
out of the resistance

99
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:12,300
steel is weakness to fighting and flying

100
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:16,940
is resistance so like minus one plus one

101
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,940
it's in neutral

102
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:23,820
we put that

103
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:28,280
with the right

104
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:28,280
yes oh yeah fighting I remember

105
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:39,720
you've got me I forgot

106
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:43,080
and we also put

107
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:46,440
four times with this resistance as as

108
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:48,419
four times resistance only works on

109
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,840
those types if they're like both

110
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:55,280
resistance to that time and they're both

111
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,280
resistance to grass and bug

112
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:06,320
but it is also a steel is resistance to

113
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,320
psychic

114
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:12,360
resistance today is also resistance to a

115
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,160
dragon

116
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,160
the distance the flying

117
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:24,360
is really sense to steal

118
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:27,539
is assistant too fairy the steel is

119
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,639
Venus to ground but is immune to ground

120
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:33,660
so and also if

121
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:38,039
weakness to fire so but flying is not

122
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:40,919
resistance immune so all means so

123
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:44,460
let me put that there

124
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:47,639
and and also steel is immune to poison

125
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:49,800
so let me put that there

126
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:53,759
for like this one

127
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:56,520
I can do this but for this part I can't

128
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,740
really do it because because it's kind

129
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:01,080
of like your choice like I can't

130
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:05,400
determine this move for like a daughter

131
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:07,319
you can just move or a different move so

132
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,539
it's kind of your choice

133
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:11,819
um which moves you use so and I can't

134
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:13,919
really determine what move you use so I

135
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:16,440
can't really do this

136
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,960
but I can't do that because that that's

137
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:21,000
kind of like my Pokemon that's the

138
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,560
Pokemon that's the Pokemon that's like

139
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,500
the Pokemon's 40. you can't really

140
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,920
change your body it makes sense or

141
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,160
choose your body

142
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:31,380
[Music]

143
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,599
so yeah

144
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:37,020
what have you learned today ah okay so

145
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:39,060
that I'm flying type the fat is the

146
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:42,120
moving Pokemon

147
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:45,360
and we also take a look at this the

148
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:48,660
flying sphere so usually you combine the

149
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:51,120
two Pokemons which has different

150
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:53,720
strengths and weakness

151
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,720
yeah

152
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:02,639
one can only have one type

153
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:06,259
okay so we have two more to go which is

154
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,259
the grass and grounds yeah

155
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,139
okay okay

156
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,740
thank you

157
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:12,740
bye
