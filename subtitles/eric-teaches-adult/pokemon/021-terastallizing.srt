1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
hello America I'm gonna teach you about

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:07,620
math sliding so interactivating is a

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,760
thing in let's put on skull and water

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:13,639
that like you can like you only can like

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:17,279
die relaxing

6
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:21,440
and Mega Evolution you only can

7
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,440
you can trust them at once

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,539
okay so time vaccines make it bigger so

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:30,000
what's this it's making like tarately

10
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,980
it's like basically like Chris Crystal

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,920
kind of like

12
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:38,219
it's like it's hard to explain it's like

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,680
kind of like Crystal make it Crystal

14
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:44,579
yeah make a crystal and they also have

15
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:47,280
this like head key and and which hints

16
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:50,100
about who is it's Terror type when you

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,440
trust a lot of it but they they also

18
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,960
gain a terror type and it's only one

19
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,840
territory it can't be dual type and it

20
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,719
only can be one type so you can get into

21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,840
what one time let's see like

22
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,320
like a meowskarada is one of the

23
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:10,740
starters is a grassland dog type it's

24
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:14,760
mostly going to be is a grass I have a

25
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:18,600
grass territory and and that is primary

26
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:21,180
is grass type is grass and the evolution

27
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:25,080
before are just pure grass types like

28
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:27,659
grass and also you don't need to have a

29
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,520
there's such thing as a character having

30
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:32,939
a Pokemon having a terror attack which

31
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,280
is not noticed and time like like a

32
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:37,380
Pikachu could have a flying territory

33
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,759
when there's no flying type a Pikachu is

34
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,759
just electric it doesn't offline

35
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:46,619
also it will gain Boost from that from

36
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,200
its Terror type so let's say it's Terror

37
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:52,380
type is I don't like poison and then you

38
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,899
can get a boost for Poison type moves

39
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:58,500
okay

40
00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:02,579
and and for different territory it has

41
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:05,399
different like taxes and and and it's

42
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:08,119
like and then you can know what what's

43
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:08,119
this character

44
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:16,920
at the same time

45
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:19,319
they're not in the same game so I get no

46
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:22,680
what do you mean not in the same because

47
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:24,660
die next thing is is in sword and shield

48
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,060
and trializing in

49
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:29,400
in Scotland violet

50
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:32,459
and it's kind of violet there isn't done

51
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,500
nothing and then sword and shield there

52
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:37,800
is into asphalizing

53
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:40,680
I see okay okay and then both of them

54
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:44,040
there is a Mega Evolution so before you

55
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:46,440
ask okay yeah we also talk about make a

56
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:49,620
little Evolution okay so I see so the

57
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,060
Pokemon is like different games and you

58
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:54,540
can't mix

59
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:57,000
the skills set but you don't need to die

60
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:59,459
an actual trash size or

61
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,840
Omega rub or whatever because you also

62
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:02,459
have a

63
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,280
problem you don't need to do that till

64
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:08,040
like win there's this like Terror race

65
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,340
in sword and shield there there were

66
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:14,640
dinosaurs and down next race you battle

67
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:18,120
with three other people and then against

68
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,980
a down next Pokemon and then you and

69
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,900
then you fight yeah and then and then

70
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:24,000
you have the Killer and then and then

71
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,739
you can catch it or you don't have to

72
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,019
catch it you don't have to catch it so

73
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:31,200
but you can catch if you want and in

74
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:33,360
draculating you can go to this Terror

75
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,800
race which are basically like a bunch of

76
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,200
crystals so

77
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,720
and then you can battle a

78
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,780
terrestrialized Pokemon and I think with

79
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:46,680
terrestrialized Pokemon is uh now I'm

80
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:49,620
not with Terror type is random so so you

81
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:52,200
can get a Pokemon with a completely

82
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:55,440
different Terror type two which is usual

83
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:58,319
sometimes you can get Pokemon with

84
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:01,440
Terror attacks with with Terror types of

85
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:04,620
which they don't have a move for it like

86
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:06,840
let's say uh you have a cloth Style with

87
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,239
a terror type flying it doesn't have a

88
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,299
flying type mode so it won't get boosted

89
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:15,780
so that's why uh they I think that's why

90
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:19,979
they made a move called Terra Blast so

91
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:22,560
if I were to to rasterize a class higher

92
00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:25,740
into flying type and then use Terra

93
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,360
Blast Terror blast will become a flying

94
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,660
time move and then that will become

95
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,840
boosted it doesn't change his music and

96
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:36,479
it still is basically still the same but

97
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:40,860
just like if the appearance is different

98
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:44,780
and one move is boosted and I'm not

99
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:44,780
saying my king is type

100
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,560
changes type what do you mean so it

101
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:55,440
could be from water to park okay yeah

102
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,600
you can get them from like terrorists

103
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:01,199
but sometimes they're the same I see

104
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:04,080
okay interesting okay and in case you in

105
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,900
case you want to learn like what it what

106
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,600
like what I hate you look like

107
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:12,600
um

108
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:16,860
I'm gonna draw example like ghosts okay

109
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:20,419
so so it had a hair give like this

110
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,419
it was that and then

111
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,560
something like that no okay okay

112
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:51,360
and then I just have that on his head

113
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,620
and the negative

114
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:58,220
it also has a mouth

115
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:58,220
