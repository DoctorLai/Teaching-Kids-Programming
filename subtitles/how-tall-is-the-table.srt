1
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:18,060
yeah so let's say t equals table

2
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:20,820
[Music]

3
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,140
C equals okay

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,279
and

5
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,279
T equals

6
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:28,629
[Music]

7
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:39,059
so obviously there is two the same

8
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:40,450
tables right yeah let's do some table so

9
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:42,660
this is turtle

10
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,300
[Music]

11
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:50,280
this is the

12
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:52,260
this is the table table so table is X

13
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,559
here

14
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,739
and this is the

15
00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:00,739
cat okay

16
00:00:57,739 --> 00:01:02,539
so what can we get from here

17
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:05,280
170 plus

18
00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:08,280
170 plus t

19
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,280
X

20
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:16,560
classy all right yeah 170 plus T is it

21
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,840
this big right is it equals to X plus C

22
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,979
and now let's take a look at this one

23
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:25,799
here this is no cap right same thing cat

24
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:27,479
plus 130 equals

25
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:31,759
please speak

26
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:33,960
X Plus what's the speed this what's this

27
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,840
X Plus t

28
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,400
what do we get we have these two we want

29
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,420
to find out

30
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:48,020
x x equals 170

31
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:51,720
plus T minus C and then here x equals

32
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:54,420
130 plus C minus t

33
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:59,700
add it together what do we have ADD it

34
00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:04,079
together 2x 2x equal here is T minus t

35
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:06,860
here is C is minus C cancel out

36
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,539
equals 300 what's X

37
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:12,300
okay we're looking at this this equation

38
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:14,900
what's the size of the table okay I'm

39
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,900
working 24

40
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:21,120
this table

41
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,940
make sense

42
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,819
they have no idea why because it's hard

43
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:30,000
to to do less mess in your head but when

44
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:35,640
I put it down I can hear the value T C

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:38,099
cat X table so look Tata plus 170 is it

46
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,599
equal this high right this is the same

47
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:43,200
as X

48
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:46,140
cable plus cap yeah that's no cat that's

49
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,239
a human okay the first equation and how

50
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:52,920
about this one

51
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:56,040
X Plus Theta is equals cat plus 130

52
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,260
right look the right one has a

53
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,379
yeah

54
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,379
what happened

55
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,599
we are interested in this x variable

56
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,879
right how about if we move these things

57
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:10,860
from the right hand side from one side

58
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,599
of the equation to the other side what

59
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,879
happened to the side we make it the

60
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:17,459
opposite right look when you put move

61
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:20,340
the C to the left side you need to minus

62
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:23,940
C right it makes sense yeah

63
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:27,000
yeah it's like a hundred equals 60 plus

64
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:28,800
40. so when you move the 40 to the left

65
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,379
hand side what happened

66
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:34,319
minus 40 is the same thing look

67
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:35,700
we want to know that X we move the T to

68
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,099
the left hand side so it needs to be

69
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:41,640
minority and then look x equals this x

70
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:44,640
equals this we add it together

71
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:47,159
the left hand side is 2 times x the

72
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,099
right hand side look here is T here's

73
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:53,540
minus t comes out here is C here's minus

74
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:58,200
C because R so only constant of seventy

75
00:03:53,540 --> 00:04:02,220
170 plus 130 300 so 2x equals 300 x

76
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:04,980
equals 150 but to the other hand this

77
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:08,599
this value of T and C matter can we

78
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:13,500
solve all the T and C here can we

79
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:17,760
look two equations two two equations

80
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:20,760
three unknowns yes we are known as

81
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:23,220
we can't we can't solve it right

82
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:25,560
why can we solve solve the X here

83
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:28,680
because we cancel out

84
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,139
the two T and C but T and C can be

85
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,900
anything right

86
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:35,460
exactly we don't know the value of TNT

87
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:39,620
but that's that's okay we can still find

88
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:39,620
out the x value okay that's it

89
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,560
foreign
